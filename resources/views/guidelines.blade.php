            <h1>Childcare Center Review Guidelines</h1>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to share your daycare experience. We value your review,
                as do other parents searching for the best daycare option for their family. To better serve
                parents and providers, and to maintain a safe and professional website, we reserve the
                right to withhold or remove reviews that do not reflect the following guidelines:</p>

            <p><strong>Keep it professional:</strong>
                Most reviewers are sharing what they love about a provider. However, in the event you
                are unsatisfied with your experience, please state your objections clearly, and without spiteful
                words, obscene language, or personal attack.</p>

            <p><strong>Keep it focused:</strong>
                To better assist others, please share specifics about your experience.
                Here are some ideas to make your review more precise: attitude and helpfulness of
                leadership and staff, safety, cleanliness and overall orderliness of facility, daily schedule
                and routines, snacks provided, availability of educational toys, size and quality of play
                area(s), options for extra enrichment programs.</p>

            <p><strong>Keep it timely:</strong>
                Whether you have used this provider for years, or have recently taken an
                introductory tour, parents appreciate current information. Please share details that
                describe the current operation. If you are sharing a past experience, please include this in
                your review.</p>

            <p><strong>Keep it unbiased:</strong>
                We prefer reviews written by parents/primary caregivers sharing their
                personal experience with a provider. Daycare providers may respond to patron reviews,
                but should limit promotion of their facility to their profile page.</p>

            <p><strong>Keep it safe:</strong>
                Please do not mention any child or minorâ€™s name. Leadership or staff may
                be named specifically, in a respectful manner.</p>

            <p>We thank you again for taking the time to share a thoughtful review of your provider.</p>

            <p>Please encourage others to share their experience also.</p>
