Little Red is Montessori Based Preschool and Early Learning Center (Philosophy), located in the beautiful, mountain town of Breckenridge, Colorado. We offer Infant & Toddler programs as well as Preschool and Pre-Kindergarten Programs with ages ranging from 8 weeks to 5 years.

As a school we are committed to the independence and uniqueness of the individual; therefore, our approach to education is based on/around the child’s needs and values. We believe that the early years are the most formative in child’s development and we strive to instill in each child that they are capable and competent.

As qualified and educated teachers we engage, observe and document the children to better understand and support their individual needs and design age appropriate experiences and lessons.

As a Community we strongly encourage and take part in volunteering and fund raising. We value the reciprocal relationships we form with our children and families as well as the relationships our children form with one another.

In essence, our goal, as teachers, community members and a school environment is to prepare the children for future experiences, and inspire, encourage, and facilitate lifelong learning. ";"http://www.littleredbreck.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/LittleRedBreck";"Mon - Fri:

We follow the curriculum of Archdiocese of Denver and CAEYC (Colorado Association for the Education of Young Children).

Self-paced controlled play is the best way for children to learn.  Play touches on every aspect of development and learning.  Children at play are actively involved in creating themes, exploring and establishing environments, solving problems, and developing shared understandings.

All of our teachers are trained in early childhood education.  In order to provide a quality childhood educational experience for each child, the ratio of teachers to students i no more than seven children to one teacher.

It is so exciting to see both of these transitions. The growth each and every child has made physically, emotionally, socially and academically is something to celebrate.

We are  located only an hour away from two world - renowned ski resorts, Aspen and Vail, and our area provides year round opportunities to appreciate the beauty of Colorado. We serve a  community of 285 students from Preschool through fourth grade. Our student enrollment  is a reflection of our community population, with our student count being 48% White and  45% Hispanic along with 47% of our students receiving free/reduced meals.

 Our school opened as a Preschool - 4th grade elementary school in the fall of 2008 when our neighboring school became overpopulated. Many of our staff worked together previously at the former school and came willingly to Elk Creek Elementary. Through the years here at Elk Creek our experienced staff has work diligently every day to bring our vision to life that “we will create a positive learning community that inspires all students and staff to become lifelong learners who will reach their highest potential.”

 Elk Creek Elementary has set a tradition as being a school of high achievement for all students. We have a network of Solutions Teams that focus on the areas of Family/Homework, Community, Response to Intervention (RtI), Positive Culture, Attendance, and English Language Learners, all led by teacher leaders. Each of these teams set quarterly goals to work towards.

 Some goals focus on school wide needs while others focus on specific subgroups of students, ultimately focusing on our “hotlist” students. Each team meets monthly to review progress towards their goals and we also all meet together as one group at the end of each quarter to share our results and any new goals that have been set. This tight network allows the whole team to stay informed and enables us to support each other while helping all students to be successful.

We have many traditions at Elk Creek Elementary to readily provide students and families with books to create a love of reading. Books are given to families at the beginning of each year at Fall Home Visits and approximately 1,000 books are awarded to students throughout each year as positive incentives for weekly student successes.

 Elk Creek Elementary exhibits a variety of strengths. We have a culture of high expectations for our students and staff. Both our leadership team and classroom teachers advocate maximizing our time within our schedule to provide opportunities to learn and thetime on task of our students. We continuously work to improve our home to school relations and welcome parent feedback through an online parent surveys. We have multiple parent, community, and high school volunteers present in our classrooms each day, strengthening our support system for our students. Families who struggle with homework, can be supported by staff and parent volunteers who run our daily homework support system called Homework Café. With frequent monitoring and feedback provided around instruction, our teachers work each day to become better at their practice. Systems are in place that allows teachers to observe and give feedback to each other as well, which is successful because of the trust and respect that they have in each other as a team.

 In the short amount of time that Elk Creek Elementary has been in existence many great accomplishments have materialized due to the hard work of our students, strong partnership with our families, and dedication of our staff. We work hard “to encourage, nurture, and challenge every student, every day,” just as our district vision statement sites. Students with significant gaps are supported and embraced by the whole staff as it takes a village to raise a child. In 2012 we were honored to be a recipient of the Colorado Governors Distinguished Improvement Award, recognizing our efforts to be a school of high achievement and high growth. We continue to work hard each day to rise to these high expectations. We take an intense look at our yearly data and put into place our plan to address the needs of our students so that we can continue to close the achievement gaps and see the growth of all of our students.

The Community of Karval came into existence with the second “homestead act of 1908.” This act allowed individuals to apply and settle on 320 acres of land. If they satisfied the government requirements, the property became theirs. A portion of these requirements were to live on the property for a period of three years, build a residence, and plow a required number of acres.

In the early 1900s, Til Hershberger, Jim Peyton, the George Barker family, and others settled in this area. These early homesteaders had the responsibility of building the first churches and schools in Karval.

In the fall of 1903, George Barker built the first little red school house. He hauled the lumber from Hugo and the building was erected by Mr. Anderson. The first teacher was Vera Tobine, who received $40.00 for her wages. Out of that, she paid $12.00 for her room and board. School started in November and the school year lasted six months. The first students were Joy and Bertha Barker. As the early settlers migrated in, the Huckaba children, George Wezel, and the Culver children attended the school. Soon, another school was built near the Wezel’s and additional teachers were hired. By this time, more homesteaders were using the schools

Gulick Kravig was the first postmaster of the post office established in 1911. He had the privilege of naming the post office. Having come from a valley in Norway called Kars Valley, he suggested using the first three letters Kar and Val making the name Karval which has been used since.

In the spring of 1913, District 23 was formed. It had two townships and two sections. Bonds were passed to build the Karval, Webb, Cross, and Dudley schools. Prior to this, many schools were held in people’s homes. Three high school girls attend the first school built, the Webb School. The Carl Kravig school replaced the little red school house built by George Barker, and the Cross school only lasted one year.

In 1921, a new school was built and all the schools were consolidated into the town of Karval. This one-room school house was only 14 feet by 16 feet. The second school had four rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs. The third had four rooms and an auditorium. In 1951, Blue Cliff District combined with Karval to make a larger district and a better school. This school had seven teachers and the principal was a local gentleman, Quentin Kravig. Mr. Kravig was related to Barker who built the first school.

This new school had a grade school, high school, full size gymnasium, a modern kitchen, and lunchroom. It cost $160,000 and was the culmination of the hopes and dreams of many of the Karval residents.";"http://www.karvalschool.org/";;;"http://www.karvalschool.org/administration/jobs/";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.karvalschool.org/wp-content/themes/cleandistrict/images/karvalsdlogo.png";;;;;;

We have an environment designed to motivate each child as an individual to grow, explore, discover, make decisions, practice social skills, and develop their creativity.  Through daily interactions children will realize their full potential at each stage of development while challenging their bodies and minds to move forward to the next stage.

 Our classrooms enhance learning through discovery.  It is important to us that children learn from hands on experiences, which are provided in science, math, social studies, music, art, and large and small motor development.

 Our program will have a vast focus on literacy/language.   We want to provide all children the opportunity to communicate in a way that best fits them as an individual.  Print is integrated into most of our activities exposing children to the written word.  Communication will be mastered through role modeling by the staff, which will facilitate problem solving and language building.  All areas of the classroom provide opportunity for children to express themselves in a variety of ways including verbal communication.

 Most important to our program are the children and their families.  We know that you are our biggest asset and your little ones first and most important teacher.  If at any time you have concerns, ideas, or questions, you are encouraged to visit with the preschool staff.  Together we can create a safe nurturing environment where children learn through their experiences.  We (family and staff) as a team can make your child’s preschool years very positive and enjoyable.

Day Care Center Norwood NJThe one thing we know about all children is that they will grow and one day become adults.  It is during their educational years when they will become most knowledgeable. The goals of education are to provide the children with the tools necessary to obtain knowledge in an environment that is both caring and compassionate.  It is important to provide this environment for children for their comfort and ability to learn. Children will be encouraged to learn by interacting with one another.  Collaborative working and social involvement will lead the children to become excellent problem solvers.

The Norwood PreSchool philosophy is to engage children not only in the learning process, but also in developing the desire to learn.  In order to engage children, we feel there needs to be creativity, hands on activities and a challenge.  The challenge will lead to questions, observations, ideas and curiosity.  Every child learns differently, and with this in mind we will create a learning environment that best suits the needs of all children.  Engaging children to learn will be something they’ll never forget. They will take the knowledge we have taught and use it throughout their lives.  We will never know where our influence has stopped!

At Holy Trinity School, each child will learn the truths of the Catholic Faith, a love of prayer and its importance in daily living, an awareness of the need for each child to work for peace and justice and be guided to integrate these religious truths into daily life.

The second primary goal, equally important, is to provide superior educational opportunities in the preparation of each child to meet the challenges of an ever-changing society through a consistently excellent curriculum of study.  Holy Trinity prepares students to be self-confident, life-long learners and responsible citizens.

A third major focus of Holy Trinity Catholic School is character development.  Through a strong faith-filled and academically challenging curriculum, children at Holy Trinity develop a response to God’s call for their lives.  This call is exhibited by an increase of religious values, respect, foresight, and responsibility for the self and others.

Focus: Indian Peaks has an instructional focus of Science, Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) along with Early Transitional Bilingual Instruction. The STEM Instructional Focus is the foundation of the high-quality research based instructional programming that is offered to all students PreK through grade five. The natural convergence of the sciences, partnered with literacy, provides students with an outstanding foundation of essential skills while integrating the development of problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills and the ability to collaborate to enhance learning.

Our Early Transitional Bilingual Instruction offers Spanish literacy instruction K-3rd grade to students whose dominant native language is Spanish. Students receive literacy instruction in Spanish, which includes reading and writing instruction. They also receive 60 minutes daily of English literacy instruction, affording them the necessary skills to be successfully bi-literate in Grade Three. Math, Science, and Social Studies are taught in English with Spanish support as necessary. Our goal for our bilingual instruction students is that they will be successfully bi-literate by third grade. Teachers provide differentiated, rigorous instruction to all students in order to prepare them for continued academic success.";"http://ipes.stvrain.k12.co.us/Preschool.html";"https://www.facebook.com/svvsdindianpeaks";"9:00 a.m. to 3:40 p.m.";;"http://www.svvsd.org/schools/enrollment-registration";"http://ipes.svvsd.org/about/handbooks";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://ipes.svvsd.org/files/ipesHeader.png";;;;;;

A recent study by the British Medical Journal found the regular to vigorous exercise improves teens' academic performance and seems to help girls do better in science.

Young girls are more likely to have lower self-esteem and body image that boys of the same age. The study found that confidence, self-esteem, emotional well-being, stress, body image and eating disorders can improve as a result of physical activity.

Results of this study and a recent emphasis on STEM education has brought companies together to support Girls on the Run.

The program is a physical activity-based positive youth development program designed to develop and enhance girls' social, psychological and physical competencies to gain positive life experiences.

Participants in Girls on the Run will train for a 5K and use curriculum targeted to building competence, confidence, connection, character, caring and contribution.

There are 130 schools working with Girls on the Run across the Front Range.";"http://vaughn.aurorak12.org/";;"7:45 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Their commitment to safety, fun and learning and the professional staff to see it through provides the foundation for their hope that all children will come through their programs with a lifelong love of learning.

The ECC has been serving children and families in the Fort Collins community since 1929 and we are dedicated to working in partnership with families to ensure a quality educational experience for children.  In our Reggio-Emilia inspired school, meaningful educational experiences are planned in a caring atmosphere to promote the physical, social, emotional, and intellectual growth of each child. We believe that by encouraging self-expression and curiosity and by supporting the active exploration of the environment, both at home and at school, that children will develop a healthy self-image, a sense of responsibility and helpfulness, and that they will learn problem solving and decision making skills.

We invite you to browse through our website and learn more about the Early Childhood Center and our Reggio-Emilia inspired philosophy.

In a faith filled atmosphere, the message of Christ takes priority and becomes integral to all areas of school activity.

All the members of St. Therese School staff have been specially chosen by Christ to be Christian role models. They proclaim the ""Good News"" of Christ to our children by teaching Christian values and serving God, the church, and the community through prayerful reflection, traditional academic and social skills, and by nurturing the development of the total child.

We believe in offering the best opportunities to all of our students while fostering a well-balanced and multi-cultural environment. Our students are of a diverse ethnic background consisting of an even percentage of Caucasian/mixed, Black, Hispanic, and Asian.

We provide play and learning experiences that are age appropriate, stimulating, and fun! A balance of active and quiet play is offered. All activities, both individual and group, are geared toward the emotional, social, physical, cognitive, aesthetic and individual growth of young children. We conduct self-evaluations of all our teachers using the CLASS system (see below to learn more) to ensure highest quality of teacher student relationships.

Popular “Camp Experiences” like Mud Mucking, At Home in the Woods, and Bird Banding utilize local prairie grasslands, evergreen forests, and wetland habitats as a classroom and enable youth to connect with and learn about nature. While we cannot guarantee your children will return home clean from Thorne Summer Camp, we are certain they will have both a big smile on their face, and probably one or two things to teach you about a local trail, a native wildflower, or one of many creatures they encountered while playing and learning with Thorne.";"http://www.thornenature.org/programs/summer-camps/";"https://www.facebook.com/ThorneNatureExperience";"8:15am

Here, the child is the focus, the teacher the facilitator.
We approach each child's academic, creative, emotional, physical and social development as a unique and interconnected process. From the early years through adolescence, our goal is to provide students with age-appropriate educational and developmental experiences that encourage them to learn by making connections.
An experienced, perceptive faculty works to cultivate a familial environment in which each student can achieve his or her potential. Rather than imposing a finite, generalized body of knowledge, our curriculum stresses experience and the application of skills, tools, and understanding as the most effective method to build confidence and character.
Through a multitude of methods and environments, we work to engage our students in the learning process. By making it relevant to them personally, by helping them reflect on who they are and how they, as individual citizens, can apply their knowledge, we release them solidly into the world. They emerge from Cannon Learning Center self-assured in the quality of their ideas and actions, confident in their abilities, and well prepared for the path ahead.

Built on an in-depth understanding of multilingual education, we offer the ICLCA a totally innovative curriculum designed to lay the strongest possible foundations of Early Childhood. By using language and creative art as the common ground, coupled with our holistic approach, we understand how early exposure to multilingualism and creativity will influence the learning process and shape the child's future more comprehensively than most people realise. Throughout a unique learning environment, we encourage the development of the children's’ self-esteem, their self confidence in their own abilities, and the independence that will enable them to unfold their imaginations and learn from successes and mistakes alike. Evident to our success, are our 3 strategically placed multilingual Kindergarten schools in Dubai which are located in the Green Community, in Jumeira and in Al Barsha, catering to over 640 children of more than 50 nationalities……..and we don’t plan to stop there! The concept of The Children’s Garden is special and not comparable to other Nursery schools in Dubai.

We are so excited that you are considering our facility as an option for your little ones. Our educational childcare goes far beyond what you’d find in traditional daycare. We take a different approach to early childhood education based on the belief that every child is willing and eager to learn. We also believe that for a child to develop a love of learning, meaningful relationships with responsive and respectful adults is absolutely essential. Our teachers strive daily to develop exactly those kinds of relationships with our students.

Our teaching strategies also offer a different approach to learning. The program seeks to develop every child’s individual interests and abilities through an emphasis on hands-on active learning. It also provides every child with frequent opportunities for self-expression — something widely recognized to be an essential component in every child’s development. Choose from year-round, summer camp, or school year, full or part-time, programs for children from six weeks to six years old.

We encourage you to explore our website for additional information. Feel free to contact us to schedule a tour of our brand new 5000 plus square foot facility and natural outdoor play area.

Daws always had a heart for boys and continuously sought new ways to minister to them. In 1953, The Navigators purchased Glen Eyrie in Colorado Springs, and moved its headquarters there. The 330-acre Eagle Lake property was included in the purchase, on the condition that it be used for youth work. In 1957, Lorne Sanny, Trotman's successor, asked Cec Davidson of the Glen Gang to get something started up at the property. Cec and four other men acquired some old marine tents and took 13 local boys camping for a week. This was the beginning of Eagle Lake Camp. Since then, second and third generations of campers from all 50 states and dozens of foreign countries have attended Eagle Lake. The great outdoors, combined with the fun and energy of being with others their age doing things they may have never done before, is an atmosphere kids of all ages want and need. At Eagle Lake, we make every effort to understand and fulfill this desire...and bring the person of Jesus Christ into their lives as well.

In 1995, a group of parents came together believing that they could create a school where high academic standards, small class sizes, and respect and responsibility are valued and emphasized. Lewis-Palmer Charter Academy (renamed Monument Academy in 2000) was founded in 1996.

The first year opening enrollment was approximately 180 students. We have steadily grown since 1996 to the current school year, offering classes to Preschool through 8th Grade students. We are continuing to carry the torch of a rigorous academic curriculum with small class sizes in a caring community environment.

Since Monument Academy’s founding, we have remained true to our mission and vision by effectively educating students in a caring atmosphere that includes high standards and expectations. Our test scores have remained high even though as a charter school we operate on less funding than other public schools.

As a charter school we are a publicly funded, tuition-free school (with the exception of Preschool and Full-Day Kindergarten) created by parents, teachers, and community members for the purpose of creating a distinctive school. We are required to meet or exceed district and state academic standards, as well as abide by all state and federal non-discrimination, health and safety laws.

Our current enrollment has surpassed nine-hundred students with a staff of over one-hundred dedicated professionals. We comprise nearly 15% of our entire district enrollment. Through our newly negotiated contract with the district (2012), we enjoy a collaborative and communicative relationship of mutual respect. District 38 is a high-performing district of which Monument Academy contributes in stellar fashion.";"http://www.monumentacademy.net/";;;"http://www.monumentacademy.net/employment/";"http://www.monumentacademy.net/enrollment/";"http://www.monumentacademy.net/studentparent-handbook/";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

On Monday, you could build a rocket ship, on Tuesday take a trip down the Nile River, and on Wednesday read and discuss your favorite book. By Thursday, you could move on to solve quadratic equations, and to end the week you could plan and host a party. How could you ever grow bored if your job provided you the opportunity to do all these things in one week, followed by a host of new challenges the very next? Picture how your ambition would soar if you were able to have the versatility to choose what you would like to work on.
 When a child enters a Montessori classroom this is what they encounter, on a child’s level. Through activities that the children call “works,” they can build a model rocket ship using wooden blocks, or they can take a trip down the Nile by learning about the people and animals of Africa. Maybe they can’t solve quadratic equations (yet!), but they can learn how numbers relate to each other using counting beads and an abacus. They learn to serve themselves a snack, and clean up when they are done. They are immersed in an environment that caters to their needs. They find furniture that is their size, a cabinet that is ready for them to choose what they would like to have for a snack, and shelves filled with enticing and enriching “works.”    
 Dr. Maria Montessori developed her approach through observing the ways in which children learn; discovering that children have “absorbent minds,” that
they literally absorb information from their environment. In a Montessori classroom, children are encouraged to learn at their own pace in a self-correcting, “prepared environment.” In this prepared environment, they focus on the areas of practical life, sensory awareness, language, mathematics, and cultural subjects. The teacher in the classroom facilitates the learning process by guiding children and demonstrating proper use of “works,” but do not interfere in the learning process. Maria Montessori said, “We must be taught and we must be willing to accept guidance if we wish to become effective teachers.”";"http://www.fruitamontessori.com/";;"8:30 - 1:45";"http://www.fruitamontessori.com/Employment-Opportunities.html";;"http://www.fruitamontessori.com/Handbook.html";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"n";"http://www.fruitamontessori.com/bg-1-25825.jpeg?u=2503566518";;;;;;

Popular “Camp Experiences” like Mud Mucking, At Home in the Woods, and Bird Banding utilize local prairie grasslands, evergreen forests, and wetland habitats as a classroom and enable youth to connect with and learn about nature. While we cannot guarantee your children will return home clean from Thorne Summer Camp, we are certain they will have both a big smile on their face, and probably one or two things to teach you about a local trail, a native wildflower, or one of many creatures they encountered while playing and learning with Thorne.";"http://www.thornenature.org/programs/summer-camps/";"https://www.facebook.com/ThorneNatureExperience";"8:15am

Here, the child is the focus, the teacher the facilitator.
We approach each child's academic, creative, emotional, physical and social development as a unique and interconnected process. From the early years through adolescence, our goal is to provide students with age-appropriate educational and developmental experiences that encourage them to learn by making connections.
An experienced, perceptive faculty works to cultivate a familial environment in which each student can achieve his or her potential. Rather than imposing a finite, generalized body of knowledge, our curriculum stresses experience and the application of skills, tools, and understanding as the most effective method to build confidence and character.
Through a multitude of methods and environments, we work to engage our students in the learning process. By making it relevant to them personally, by helping them reflect on who they are and how they, as individual citizens, can apply their knowledge, we release them solidly into the world. They emerge from Cannon Learning Center self-assured in the quality of their ideas and actions, confident in their abilities, and well prepared for the path ahead.

Partnering between school and family is, therefore essential to the maximum growth and development of all young children.
 
Our aim is to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment that accommodates and embraces differences. Our goal is to promote the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of each child.
 
Positive discipline places emphasis on preventing problems by attending to the room arrangement, having age-appropriate expectations, providing interactive activities, and active adult monitoring and supervision.
 
Appropriate behavior is fostered by helping children learn to control their behavior and work out their conflicts with others rather than relying solely on adults to manage their behavior and intervene in disputes.
 
We believe in combining learning with play, as children learn best by doing. We strive for a balance between teacher-directed and child-initiated activities, providing the foundation of a developmentally appropriate early childhood program. Given opportunities to explore the world around them, young children become active, involved learners. School becomes a place where they can be successful and children discover that learning is fun.

 We believe, with this foundation, children become curious, well-rounded learners, able to make independent choices and act responsibly.

Our program emphasizes a balance of teacher directed activities and free-choice play.  Research has proven that young children learn best thru play and not traditional paper/pencil type activities.

The Child Development Center has 15 classrooms of children ages infant through 5-year-olds. Around 250 children are enrolled in the program, and the center sees around 125 to 150 of those children each day.

The center has a daily structured schedule for the children that is based from the Creative Curriculum. As a part of the Creative Curriculum, the children get to enjoy activities such as painting, water play, cooking activities, playing on the playground and sandbox.

""Accreditation truly does improve the quality of care we give,"" said Sue Huffman, Director of the Child Development Center.

The NAEYC accreditation standards were set to improve the quality of programs for children throughout the country. Ten different standards are set by the NAEYC, those standards are then broken down into 265 different areas that cover all aspects of child care giving and the education of young children.

Accreditation standards exceed state licensing standards and less than 10 percent of child care facilities across the country are accredited. Accreditation is valued by the Child Development Center and by its customers because it has higher education guidelines for staff, standards for toys and equipment, and higher health standards.

    St. Francis Catholic School will be one of the top 20% of schools in the state of Iowa.
    St. Francis Catholic School will develop a scorecard that allows us to determine how we are performing against our goal. This scorecard will include both “status” scores that indicate how our students are performing in comparison with others and “growth” scores that measure academic progress over time and across grades.
    St. Francis Catholic School will ensure that students have the opportunity to realize their full potential through the Extended Learner Program and Assisted Learning Program.

Prior to opening West Side Kids the three of us spent several years in the daycare field and business management.  In January of 2005 the stars aligned and West Side Kids was created. We leased a building, had it renovated to our needs, and opened for business July 5th, 2005.  In October 2009 we began construction at our current location and the building was completed in June of 2010.  Moving to our own space gave us the opportunity to improve a few things.  For example we were able to add an indoor gym for those cold or rainy days, which is also used for our school age program, an extra room for our crawlers and beginning walkers,  a larger playground that is separated into younger and older kids, a break room for our teachers, and several other smaller things. 

    Our goal at West Side Kids is to provide genuine care, excellent communication, and a messy good time!  None of that would be possible without the help of our excellent teachers, parents, and kids!  Most of our teachers have been with us for several years and are all very caring,  knowledgeable, and experienced. Our teachers are well trained in CPR, 1st Aid, universal precautions, and are mandatory reporters of child abuse. They also receive a minimum of eight hours of continuing education every year.      

It is our philosophy and objective to make West Side Kids feel like a second home to you and your children and we hope you will love and enjoy our ""family"" as much as we do!

Head Start, administered by South Central Iowa Community Action Program (SCICAP), has been in operation since 1966.

We have independent Head Start centers and five collaborations with school districts, with the four-year-old state initiative pre-school program.  The school districts have agreed to follow Head Start Performance Standards, which the Iowa Department of Education recognizes as a sign of high quality and exemplary programs.  Unique to Head Start Programs from other Early Childhood Programs, is individualizing for ALL children and parent engagement, which our school district collaborations follow.

We have two full day State Shared visions programs in two counties, which offer full day service to the children and their families that work or go to school.

Five Head Start Centers and Five School District collaborations, serve the communities by providing age appropriate quality comprehensive programs with kindergarten readiness skills, nutritious breakfast and lunches, health screenings, social services and parent involvement opportunities to each of the 212 children enrolled and their families.  All classrooms in our five counties have certified Early Childhood teachers, to best serve our children so they are kindergarten ready.

All centers/schools are using the research based on line Teaching Strategies GOLD by Diane Trister Dodge.  Our goal is for our children to be kindergarten ready, but more important to be a lifelong learner.

In two counties State Wrap-Around funds allow us to provide extended hours, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to assist families with working parents or those needing to fulfill schooling and training obligations. 

 This year our program had to go through the re-compete process and our grant was written and downloaded in July of 2012.  We anxiously wait to hear the results and feel confident that we will retain the grant having a perfect triennial review the year before.";"http://www.scicap.org/index.php/programs/educational-programs/childcare-adult-food-program/";;;"http://www.scicap.org/index.php/childcare-adult-food-program2/";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.scicap.org/files/5512/6946/5460/SCICAPlogo.jpg";;;;;;

Head Start, administered by South Central Iowa Community Action Program (SCICAP), has been in operation since 1966.

We have independent Head Start centers and five collaborations with school districts, with the four-year-old state initiative pre-school program.  The school districts have agreed to follow Head Start Performance Standards, which the Iowa Department of Education recognizes as a sign of high quality and exemplary programs.  Unique to Head Start Programs from other Early Childhood Programs, is individualizing for ALL children and parent engagement, which our school district collaborations follow.

We have two full day State Shared visions programs in two counties, which offer full day service to the children and their families that work or go to school.

Five Head Start Centers and Five School District collaborations, serve the communities by providing age appropriate quality comprehensive programs with kindergarten readiness skills, nutritious breakfast and lunches, health screenings, social services and parent involvement opportunities to each of the 212 children enrolled and their families.  All classrooms in our five counties have certified Early Childhood teachers, to best serve our children so they are kindergarten ready.

All centers/schools are using the research based on line Teaching Strategies GOLD by Diane Trister Dodge.  Our goal is for our children to be kindergarten ready, but more important to be a lifelong learner.

In two counties State Wrap-Around funds allow us to provide extended hours, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to assist families with working parents or those needing to fulfill schooling and training obligations. 

 This year our program had to go through the re-compete process and our grant was written and downloaded in July of 2012.  We anxiously wait to hear the results and feel confident that we will retain the grant having a perfect triennial review the year before.";"http://www.scicap.org/index.php/programs/educational-programs/childcare-adult-food-program/";;;"http://www.scicap.org/index.php/childcare-adult-food-program2/";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.scicap.org/files/5512/6946/5460/SCICAPlogo.jpg";;;;;;

        While attending Little Lambs, children will be exposed to a variety of learning experiences intended to help them get along with other people, learn Christian values, be encouraged in their curiosity and creativity, and develop self-help skills. Most important, these experiences will help them feel good about themselves, their world, and their learning. 
        Concepts they will be exposed to include Unit and Bible lessons, kindergarten readiness skills such as: shapes, numbers, letters, counting, colors, songs, finger plays, weather, phonemic awareness, and stories. Activities promote development of the whole child and include music, art, science, fine and large motor building, reading, writing, logical thinking, social, language, problem solving, nutrition, and field trips.

(Matthew 28:18-20)

Within that framework, we also understand that many of the children we will care for are already a part of another confession of faith. None the less, our daily activities will include spiritual instruction in keeping with our belief that:
    There is only one true God, who revealed Himself in Three Persons; the Father, the Son, and The Holy Spirit;           
    God the Father sent His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ, to be born of the Virgin Mary and to suffer and die on the cross in our place as payment for the sins of the world;
    After His crucifixion Jesus Christ rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, where He lives and reigns eternally with the Father;
    Jesus Christ will return on the last Day to judge both the living and the dead and to take all those who believe in Him to eternal life in heaven;
    We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone, for Christ’s sake alone;
    The Holy Spirit works through the means of grace (preaching and teaching of God’s Word and the Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring us to the forgiveness of sins and eternal life;
    The Lutheran Confessions are the correct interpretation and summary of the teachings of the Holy Scripture.

 Childcare is available for infants, toddlers and preschoolers.  A nutritious breakfast and a delicious catered hot lunch is served daily.

Montessori Childcare reinforces the ideas and experiences the children learn in their preschool classes and provides a safe, nurturing home for the children when they are not attending preschool.  Using one provider for preschool and childcare eliminates children’s transition problems and worries about who is picking them up and where they are going.  Our facility is bright, beautiful, clean and sanitary.  Our program is always planned on the basis of what is best for the children.  Our childcare is licensed and certified.

Families may elect to have their children participate in a variety of activities while using the Childcare services.  Some electives, such as swimming lessons, music, and tumbling, are fee-based.  Other electives, such as drama, art, and foreign language, are offered at no additional charge and further enrich our program.

 Drop in child care may be added to your preschool contract as needed.

Some programs offer part-time preschool followed by ""child care"" in the afternoon, but the reality is that children are growing and learning throughout the day, regardless of where they are located.  Early care and education are inseparable.  All of the time spent in early care and education should be ""quality time"" and in the company of adults who are skilled, knowledgeable, and nurturing.

It is licensed by the Department of Human Services (DHS) and is reviewed annually by DHS to ensure quality care and education.  Noah’s Ark Preschool serves children ages 3-5 and adheres to objectives which are supported by the Iowa Early Learning Standards.

At Noah’s Ark Preschool, each class has an age-appropriate schedule which encourages routine, and the curriculum focuses on skills necessary for kindergarten readiness.  Examples of curricular areas include letter and number recognition, phonological awareness, colors and shapes recognition, self-care skills, conversation and sharing skills, and beginning math concepts.  At Noah’s Ark Preschool, the children explore learning in various learning centers throughout the classroom as well as in large groups, small groups, and individually with the teacher.

At Noah’s Ark Preschool, the teachers and members of the Presbyterian United Church of Christ want all children to have opportunities for success as they embark upon their educational journeys, so tuition assistance is available for qualifying families.

Noah’s Ark Preschool employs two staff members (the Director/Teacher and the Assistant Teacher), who are certified in CPR, First Aid, Mandatory Reporting, and Universal Precautions.  They also complete at least 6 hours of continuing education each year. The preschool uses the services of Area Education Agency (AEA), DHS, Northwest Early Childhood Iowa, and Mid-Sioux Opportunity.";"http://www.pucclemars.com/hoahs-ark-preschool/";"https://www.facebook.com/noahsarkpreschoollemars/info?tab=page_info";;;"http://www.pucclemars.com/hoahs-ark-preschool/enrollment/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.pucclemars.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10955215_775121712568702_3697487174968549754_n.png";;;;;;

This put disadvantaged children at risk for academic failure and continued the cycle of poverty as working parents who were unable to afford quality, safe care for their children would not make reliable and focused employees.

Skip-a-Long's founders recognized the role high quality child care plays in helping people rise out of poverty by giving a hand up to both children and parents in hopes that they both will succeed.

Today, Skip-a-Long Child Development Services is comprised of three campuses, in two states. We also manage the Home Child Care Network, which works with home child care providers in the Illinois Quad Cities and Peoria areas and helps families needing child care during nontraditional hours.  See The Home Child Care Network for more details!

Skip-a-Long Child Development Services has evolved over the years from an agency whose main focus was to provide quality child care to the working poor, to one where quality child care is provided to all children, regardless of financial means.  We offer a sliding fee scale and work with IDHS and United Way to ensure that high-quality child care is affordable and accessible to everyone in the Quad Cities area, and that all children have the opportunity at our centers to learn from our professional staff and be prepared for success in school and in life! 

We have a strong support network of agencies in the community to provide assistance to those families that require their services for family assistance, crisis services, and financial assistance for child care. Our child care structure surpasses most quality child care centers in the activities, curriculum, and teacher quality that we offer to our parents and their children.  Learn more about the Quality Rating System and Skip-a-Long!

Our multiple sites serve a broad range of families, and Skip-a-Long's expansion has been fueled by the needs of the community. We will continue to grow and diversify as the child care needs of families in our communities continue to change.

Skip-a-Long is a program of our parent agency, Skip-a-Long Family and Community Services, and you can learn more about our other wonderful programs by visiting our agency's website!

 In Head Start, children don’t just learn how to count or identify letters (though that’s certainly an important part of the curriculum). Many people don’t know that our preschool experience also includes health services and screenings, teaches good nutrition and social skills, supports parents and promotes physical activity so children improve their motor skills. It is a safe learning environment where children are encouraged to explore their world and learn the essential skills they will need to succeed later in life.";"http://www.micaonline.org/#!hs/c1e16";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mid-Iowa-Community-Action-Inc/59628671465?fref=ts";;"http://www.micaonline.org/#!jobs/c1qgj";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/c232e6_e2c052d40c224e338990250fdd14c262.gif";;;;;;

During the summer program there is a very strong emphasis on continued education. Reading at least 30 minutes every day is a requirement. Field trips to local nature centers, fire stations, zoos, etc help keep the creativity flowing. The children also enjoy a weekly field trip to a local park/splash pad to cool off and burn off some of that extra energy.

Head Start, administered by South Central Iowa Community Action Program (SCICAP), has been in operation since 1966.

We have independent Head Start centers and five collaborations with school districts, with the four-year-old state initiative pre-school program.  The school districts have agreed to follow Head Start Performance Standards, which the Iowa Department of Education recognizes as a sign of high quality and exemplary programs.  Unique to Head Start Programs from other Early Childhood Programs, is individualizing for ALL children and parent engagement, which our school district collaborations follow.

We have two full day State Shared visions programs in two counties, which offer full day service to the children and their families that work or go to school.

Five Head Start Centers and Five School District collaborations, serve the communities by providing age appropriate quality comprehensive programs with kindergarten readiness skills, nutritious breakfast and lunches, health screenings, social services and parent involvement opportunities to each of the 212 children enrolled and their families.  All classrooms in our five counties have certified Early Childhood teachers, to best serve our children so they are kindergarten ready.

All centers/schools are using the research based on line Teaching Strategies GOLD by Diane Trister Dodge.  Our goal is for our children to be kindergarten ready, but more important to be a lifelong learner.

In two counties State Wrap-Around funds allow us to provide extended hours, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to assist families with working parents or those needing to fulfill schooling and training obligations. 

 This year our program had to go through the re-compete process and our grant was written and downloaded in July of 2012.  We anxiously wait to hear the results and feel confident that we will retain the grant having a perfect triennial review the year before.";"http://www.scicap.org/index.php/programs/educational-programs/childcare-adult-food-program/";;;"http://www.scicap.org/index.php/childcare-adult-food-program2/";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.scicap.org/files/5512/6946/5460/SCICAPlogo.jpg";;;;;;

We believe that our programs should be designated to gently stimulate children to reach their full potential. Each child should have numerous successful experiences every day and approach each developmental milestone with enthusiasm, persistence and confidence. We believe this will encourage a positive self-concept and insure a lifelong love of learning.

We believe that our teachers and our caregivers need to be knowledgeable about how children grow and learn. It is important that they understand developmental growth patterns and can anticipate developmental needs and create environments and activities that encourage emerging skills in a safe and non-threatening manner.";"http://kidzoneearlylearningcenter.com/";;"6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday";;;"http://kidzoneearlylearningcenter.com/parents%20information.html";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://kidzoneearlylearningcenter.com/488016_286174771494029_578843104_n%5B1%5D.jpg";;;;;;

    We at Leaps and Bounds Children's Academy recognize the need for children to explore, create and play at their own pace.  We encourage individual growth while offering group activities that are age-appropriate.  We offer a child-centered teaching technique, encourage children to learn concepts and skills through self-discovery while our teachers remain available to maintain the flow of the classroom and assist children in their own discoveries.  We are dedicated to helping each child reach his or her full potential in a nurturing, creative environment.

Apple Tree Children’s Centers provide preschool and child care for children ages 6 weeks through 12 years.

As quoted by Mr. Rogers, “The first four years of life are more important in the development of a functioning human being than the first four years of college. Apple Tree Children’s Centers joins with parents to form a learning team to enable their child to grow and develop through the milestones of childhood.

Our programs are designed to gently stimulate children to reach their full potential, to approach each developmental stage with enthusiasm, persistence and joy. We strive to promote the growth of the whole child emotionally, physically, socially and intellectually which in turn will establish a lifelong love of learning.

With more than 20 years of experience and hundreds of years combined teaching experiences in the field of early care and education, Apple Tree understands what quality means in child care. Our Directors and teachers hold degrees in early care and education and continually take part in trainings to feed their love of learning and to stay ahead of the field. Our teachers are knowledgeable and understand how children grow, allowing them to anticipate developmental needs and create environments and activities that encourage emerging skills without frustration and fear of failure.

Our teachers will act as guides responding to each child’s special phases of learning and provide your child with the nurturing care he or she needs each day by creating a feeling of unconditional love and acceptance in each classroom. We base our care on the following Montessori concepts developed by the American Montessori Society:
Basic trust develops in an environment where people respond appropriately to the child’s communication of needs to be loved, respected and accepted.
Children learn through their senses. They learn by watching and moving freely. Freedom to move is essential to the development of the infant’s potential.
The child is considered a whole person and is affected by the quality of holding and feeding as well as the quality of physical care.
Learning which leads to independence occurs when the children participate in their daily routines of care.";"http://www.lamontessorinurtury.com/contact.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Montessori-Nurtury/494873417209837?sk=info&tab=page_info";;"http://www.lamontessorinurtury.com/careers.html";"http://www.lamontessorinurtury.com/join.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

We believe that all children can learn. Through the caring adults around them who provide real hands-on experiences, children learn valuable life skills. We believe that it is necessary to embrace the multiple intelligences of every child by providing a variety of classroom experiences. We educate the whole child to set a strong foundation on which to build a lifetime of learning. This includes social, emotional, intellectual, and physical learning. The value of play is at the forefront of everything we do. Children must be allowed to explore and construct their own knowledge of the world around them through meaningful experiences. It is our job to give them the safe environment and support they need to make sense of the world.

Our goal is to provide instruction that meets the needs of all children enrolled and activities that are accessible to all.

Our program is structured around themes, utilizing the seasons, holidays and topics of interest to the preschool aged child. We provide both large and small group experiences with activities that emphasize:

SOCIAL SKILLS
Children are given many opportunities for developing social skills as they experience communicating and cooperating with others, following directions, and developing self-control. 

CREATIVE PLAY
We believe that a child's first and most important work is their play and that much learning takes place through that activity. The children experience
 ramatic play, dress-up and house-keeping, block play, games and toys to stimulate the mind. Creative play encourages language development
and teaches everyday living skills and problem solving.

MUSIC AND MOVEMENT
Children experience listening, singing and making music with their voices and simple instruments. Creative movement helps children enjoy
and become comfortable with moving their bodies.

ART/CREATIVE EXPRESSION
Introduction of various mediums such as paint, play dough, chalk, glue, crayons, etc. to encourage the child's creativity and thought processes
where focus is on experimenting with and enjoying the creative process.

All of these activities integrate appropriate development of pre-academic skills such as reading, math and language as well as large
and small motor skills.";"http://www.meredithdrive.org/childrenswithnav/article311142.htm";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Meredith-Drive-Reformed-Church/206175870406?fref=ts";;;"http://www.meredithdrive.org/aboutus/article159975.htm";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/1482/preschoollogo.jpg";;;;;;

Our director is a registered nurse and pre-school teacher with over 20 years of experience working with children and individuals with disabilities.

In most daycares for children with special needs, a nurse stops by briefly for medications and treatments, or your child may not be seen by a nurse at all.  With a nurse onsite providing care and observation, early detection and intervention can occur before problems escalate.

Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday 6:30am to 6:30pm. At the Early Learning Academy, we do our best to ensure the safety, comfort, health, and happiness of all children in our care. We do this through providing a stimulating, fun, and educational environment plan which includes: free and structured playtime, motor skill time, story time, arts and crafts, music and dance, phonics, math and other educational programs. Children will also learn about colors, shapes, textures, numbers, letters, animals, feelings, manners and other creative concepts. We also provide nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day.

The Early Learning Academy is committed to helping parents and children to share and grow together. All of our classes focus on your childs development. We offer a developmentally appropriate cirriculum from birth to age six (6). We provide daily activity reports, progress reports, and monthly newsletters to parents. We welcome new ideas and programs for the Academy as well as fundraisers and special events. Contact Jodee for more information.

We also feel that security is very important for our families and staff. For this reason we have a security system which allows parents and staff to enter the building. Each person has a different code, which will allow them access. All of this is monitored by a computer system, which records each person who has entered the building. We have also instituted a computerized check-in/out system to record your childs daily attendance. This system will also allow you to retrieve messages from your teachers, check on your tuition payments and to make sure your child is up to date on immunizations.

All teachers receive specialized training in early childhood development. CPR, First Aid, and Universal Precautions Certified. Drug and Background check. Lead teachers have a CDA, Associates Degree in Early Childhood Education, or are enrolled in classes at working towards one of these certificates/degrees.

Early Learning Academy encourages all employees to enhance their childcare education through the TEACH Scholarship.

Jan Caldwell, wife of Kingsway's first Senior Pastor John Caldwell, had a dream to start a Christian school where her children and others could receive an excellent, Christ-centered education. Because of her dream and determination, we have been privileged to provide continuous service and ministry to our community since the school doors were first opened in September of 1977. 

On the first day of school in 1977, there were two teachers and twenty-five students in first through fourth grades. What a marvelous amount of growth has taken place since then! KCS now has over 70 full and part-time teachers and staff, with over 620 students in preschool through eighth grade. We provide before and after school supervision as well.

Kingsway Christian School has been accredited by the State of Indiana since 1983 and by ACSI (the Association of Christian Schools International), the largest Christian School Association in North America since 1996. In addition, the teaching staff is well-credentialed in education and experience.

Because KCS is accredited by the State of Indiana, we participate in the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress (ISTEP+) each year in grades 3 through 8. Our 1st and 2nd grades participate in the Stanford Achievement Test given each spring. Results from both tests strongly support the quality of our academic program and graduates have gone on to do very well at their next schools. A high percentage of our students are recognized as gifted and talented, and are placed in advanced classes of math, language, music and more.

Kingsway continues to be a school striving to honor God in education and the total environment of our ministry. We praise God for providing excellent teachers, wonderful facilities, and the continued support of Kingsway Christian Church.

However, our “real” credentials are our students. We want our students to be well-adjusted Christian young people, equipped to serve God as successful secondary students, and as successful men and women equipped with Biblical decision-making skills that will guide them and stay with them throughout their lives.";"http://www.kingswayschool.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kingsway-Christian-School/101281916603818?ref=ts&fref=ts";"Mon - Fri:

The Voluntary Certification Program requires unlicensed registered ministries to meet specific standards regarding food and nutrition, health and safety, and special requirements for programs offering infant and toddler care.

The Indiana Association for Child Care Resource and Referral (IACCRR) is implementing the Hoosier Quality Child Care Expansion Project working directly with unlicensed child care programs to support their efforts to meet the standards. Marsha Thompson, Executive Director of IACCRR states, “IACCRR is committed to increasing the capacity of high quality child care in Indiana. We know high quality child care is essential to healthy communities, school readiness and lifelong learning. This program illustrates our effectiveness in working toward our goal.”

“We decided to access the extra support from the Indiana Association for Child Care Resource and Referral because we want to ensure that we are providing the best care for the families we serve,” says Amy Hayes, program director at Little Lambs. “By obtaining the VCP, we show that we are dedicated to children and that we will continue to better our Ministry to ensure a safe and nurturing environment. All children should have access to safe, caring, and adequate early childhood care.” Quality Expansion Specialist Yully Ortega mentored the Little Lambs staff through the VCP process. States Hayes,“Yully assisted us in staff trainings, networking, understanding VCP regulations, and in finding resources to help us meet our goals.”

Little Lambs Daycare Ministry is open from Monday through Friday, 5:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and accepts children between the ages of 6 weeks and 12 years. Currently there are openings in the Infant and Before/After school programs.

We are a registered daycare ministry of Floyds Knobs Christian Church. Our curriculum has a primary emphasis on the individual child. Our classrooms are center-based with new activities and lessons planned regularly. Rooms are designed so that children have numerous choices within an environment of maximum learning. Teachers act primarily as facilitators encouraging a strong partnership between the home and the daycare. 

Seeds of Knowledge is designed for children to explore newly found independence. Through individualized prescribed instruction, they engage in stimulating activities led by skilled and trained Lead Teachers. During their day, children take part in “hands-on” social interactions, physical activity, preschool, arts, crafts, and dramatics which build on their individual character. 

While under careful guidance and direction, the children are given opportunities to express themselves and to be creative through active learning. We have prepared organized “imagination stations” that are developmentally appropriate for them to interact freely with peers and designed for team development in a diverse setting.

Seeds of Knowledge was previously run under the name Play 4 Hours. Play 4 Hours opened in October of 2007 and Annie Shearer took ownership in January 2010. 

All teachers are trained and certified in First Aid and CPR. Each of them are involved in the community and have several years experience working with and caring for children of all ages.

We believe our success only comes through seeking daily spiritual growth and guidance from God. Without this we will never fully see the many wonderful blessings we believe God planned for the future of our Center’s future.

Pre-School rooms are for children 3 to 5 years old. Children in these classes will enjoy every moment they spend at the Center. The teachers in these classrooms plan daily activities that allow children to explore and participate in many helpful growth and development experiences.

We encourage discovery, creativity, and development in a safe, respectful, relationship-based environment. We put this into action through our curriculum and daily programming designed to help all children learn and grow under biblical truths. While your child is here, we will be helping him/her:

    Learn basic Christian beliefs and values that will help guide them in everyday life.
    Actively engage in and enjoy the learning process.
    Learn to question, to think, to problem solve, and to discover.
    Be creative and flexible.
    Discover their unique talents and wonderful possibilities.
    Learn to function comfortably as a member of a group.
    Become confident, strong, and competent.
    Learn to resolve conflicts in peaceful, respectful ways.
    Appreciate and respect individual differences among people and families.

The goal of the center is to provide quality educational experiences to families in and near the Hamilton Heights community.  The Little Huskies Learning Center offers four main programs to help meet this goal; Preschool, Before & After Care, Vacation Care & Summer Camp.

The Little Huskies Learning Center Preschool is a preschool program targeted for children ages 3 to 5 years old.  We offer a multi-age classroom experience for our preschools whose developmentally appropriate curriculum is not only based on the Indiana Department of Education Learning Standards for this age group but also is aligned with the Hamilton Heights Primary School’s Kindergarten curriculum.  Classroom activities include a variety of whole group, small group, and individual opportunities all developed with the children’s educational experience in mind.  Ongoing assessments and interactions with students allow teachers to help stimulate learning in all developmental areas.

The Little Huskies Learning Center Before & After Care Program is an extension of the Hamilton Heights School Corporation community.  The program is available to children ages 3 – 12 years old and offers a variety of fun and educational activities which include but are not limited to arts and crafts, recreational games, enrichment activities, computers, and supervised homework time.

The Little Huskies Learning Center Vacation & Summer Camp is designed to provide children ages 5 – 12 years old with quality and safe childcare during school breaks.

We believe that all children are God- given and learn differently; thus, we engage each individual child with a rich, interactive, differentiated, educational experience.";"http://www.ourhopelutheran.com/school.html";"https://www.facebook.com/OurHopeLutheran";"Mon - Fri:

Designed for children from 6 weeks to 6 years of age, our caregivers are experienced and trained to care for children’s needs. Care for children is provided in a safe and stimulating learning environment.

Kids First is governed by the childcare board of directors along with the trustees of First Church and registered with the state of Indiana. This means we comply with all state regulations for child care ministries.

Kids First is a non-profit organization   Thus, all monies received go toward the operational expenses of the program, and any excess monies received will be used to maintain the playground as well as purchase items needed.

We believe parents are the most significant adults in their child’s life.  We do everything possible to insure parents’ involvement with our program.  With our open door policy, parents and family are welcome and encouraged to visit at any time.

We believe and desire for all parents to have a daily contact with the director or assistant director  This will assist parents and staff to understand how to meet each child’s needs.

We believe a child’s work is their play.  Children play to learn, to grow, and to experience the world around them.  Children grow from the head down and the trunk out, they must move!  Kids First, a child centered day care, moves at a child’s pace with uninterrupted free time.  Weather permitting, their play takes them outside into God’s world.";"http://firstumcdecatur.org/?page_id=1070";"https://www.facebook.com/FUMC.Decatur?ref=br_tf";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://firstumcdecatur.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FUMC_Connect_Horizontal-e1422190649914.png";;;;;;

There are many factors that go into choosing who will take care of your child and where your child will stay while you are at work. There are quite a few differences between in-home daycare and full-featured child care centers such as Kid’s Connection that you should carefully consider.  We have listed a few of our advantages below:
 
Resources
At Kid’s Connection, we have more children, more teachers, much larger spaces, and more structured activities for your child.
 
Training
Being CDA Certified, our lead teachers have formal child care training to better provide early childhood education.  This means your child will benefit from classroom oriented lessons while at Kid’s Connection.  This will accelerate your child's education and help them transition into the classroom setting more easily.  In fact, studies show that most elementary school teachers heavily prefer children from child care centers as opposed to home-based daycares.
 
Safety
Our Child Care Centers are safe and secure.  Outside doors are kept locked and can only be opened from the inside or by integrated security control system access panels.  All rooms are monitored and recorded at all times with state-of-the-art digital recording equipment.  Not only do we monitor all rooms live, we can quickly and easily search and review all activity that took place in any part of our facility for the previous 2-week period.  We also routinely practice storm, fire, and lockdown drills, and regularly have law-enforcement and first responders come to our facilities and talk to the children about issues such as fire prevention, stranger danger, safety, and drugs.
 
Social Development
At Kid’s Connection, there will be many more children with whom your child can interact with and practice social skills.  Also, your child will placed with, and kept with, other children of the same age group, as opposed to the wide array of ages that are often mixed in a home-based environment.

Stability
Many home-based day cares are left with no option but to close if the provider is sick or other issues arise, leaving you to unexpectedly find some other care for your child that day or calling in at work so you have someone to watch your child.  At Kid’s Connection, we are always open during regularly scheduled hours.

Teachers create age appropriate learning environments that promote children to learn through play and learning centers. Activities are created based on individual needs and developmental levels. Children who are enrolled at our center are engaged in a hands on environment that is clean, healthy, and safe. In our infant/toddler and preschool programs teachers develop lesson plans that are based on a weekly theme to engage children. The infant/toddler lesson plans cover the following content areas: sensory, gross motor, fine motor, creative expression, literacy, music & movement, dramatic play, blocks, and small group activities.

It is the goal of Head Start to ensure that children begin school ready to learn. Activities are directed toward the skill and knowledge domains and domain elements.

Fully incorporating children with disabilities is a required element of the Head Start program. This initiative is beneficial to all involved, children with and without disabilities, parents and staff.

Family and community partnerships recognize the vital contributions made by parents and community members.

The program is designed to foster healthy development in low-income children. Programs deliver a range of services, responsive and appropriate to each child’s and each family’s heritage and experience that encompass all aspects of a child’s development and learning. Every program must meet the needs of the federal Head Start Performance Standards and other applicable regulations.

It is the goal of Head Start to ensure that children begin school ready to learn. Activities are directed toward the skill and knowledge domains and domain elements.

Fully incorporating children with disabilities is a required element of the Head Start program. This initiative is beneficial to all involved, children with and without disabilities, parents and staff.

Family and community partnerships recognize the vital contributions made by parents and community members. Both groups are involved in the operation, governance and the evaluation of the Head Start program. In the area of program management and operation, there is strong focus on delivering high-quality child development services to children for low- income families.";"http://www.indianaheadstart.org/cuteeditor/DIRECTORY/County/FremontCommunitySchoolfmrlyVistulaHeadStart.aspx";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Indiana-Head-Start-Association/200030710656";;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.indianaheadstart.org/Portals/0/updated%20logo.png";;;;;;

Li'l Rascals was born from her desire to work with and develop young minds and also to allow her to spend time with her young son.

For more than 32 years Li'l Rascals has been providing exceptional State Licensed child care & pre-school services to the areas in and around St. John including: Schererville, Dyer, Cedar Lake, and Crown Point. Over these years Rascals has expanded to include 3 buildings and more than 5 acres of outdoor fun and adventure!

Early Childhood Education, has been with us for more than 20 years, and the other core staff has been here for a decade or more and have their Childhood Development Accreditation (CDA)!

Currently, Li'l Rascals is owned by Georgene Resney's son, Geoff and his wife, Lisa. Since he was two years old Li'l Rascals has been a big part of Geoff's life & he is dedicated to the mission set forth by his Mom. Geoff & Lisa have 4 children ages 5 down to 6 months.

Our services and facilities include summer programs, after school care, field trips and a 2-acre playground. Since it’s never easy to leave your child in a new environment, we invite you to give us a call and setup an interview to meet our friendly staff.

There is a noticeable difference when you come into Wee Care.  Our teachers work together as a team to create a warm and loving atmosphere.  At Wee Care, we encourage our parents to talk with their child’s teachers on a daily basis.  Open communication is the key to having a warm and loving atmosphere.  One of the best compliments we feel that we have received came from our NAEYC inspector who was impressed that all of our children were so content.

LOW CHILD TEACHER RATIOS
We believe that lower child teacher ratios are safer and more conducive to learning.  We follow the NAEYC ratio standards.  We feel that our staffing directly affects the quality of care that we provide.  Wee Care is a more enjoyable environment for the children and staff because of this low ratio.

WELL EQUIPPED CLASSROOMS
We work hard to keep our classrooms well equipped.  It is important to have all of the necessary tools to run a quality program.  We are constantly looking for new grants and programs to help us do this so that we do not have to pass this cost on to our parents.

COMPUTER TIME
We believe that computers play an important part in the development of children if used properly.  At Wee Care the computer is not a substitute for TV but a tool to be used for learning.

MEALS
Meals are an important part of the curriculum at Wee Care.  Because we participate in the Federal Food Program, we are able to serve fresh fruit, baked chicken and other healthy choices.  We want the children to learn the importance of healthy eating habits.

WE ARE GREEN
Wee Care is a 5-Star Environmentally friendly school.  We hope to teach the children the importance of taking care of our environment.";"http://www.weecarecenters.com/";;;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Children are exposed to a variety of learning programs, including art, math, science, and listening (language development). They play, sing, and role-play, develop verbal language, and participate in many art projects. As their experiences and skills increase, they become more confident and take pride in what they do. All of this has immeasurable impact on the person they become.

    that children should be provided with a safe, nurturing environment which encourages a lifetime of learning.
    children are to be celebrated as individuals, worthy of respect, and supported in his or her unique cultural and developmental needs.  Children are encouraged to value cooperation, interdependence, and give respect and care to others and their environment.
    encouragement is give to each child to develop self awareness, creativity, and independence through positive interactions with staff and student peers.
    a child's physical, intellectual, emotional and social skilll development should be play-based.  Children are natural learners and are given freedom to experiment, explore, and think by exposure to open-ended opportunities and experiences which nurture growth.
    children wil be provided with age appropriate curriculum and stimulating activities which allow opportunities for reasoning, problem solving and natural and logical consequences.
    that discipline is a matter of self-control by the child.  A staff member may mediate conflict resolution between children by allowing them to express their feelings.  Staff may also use re-direction to another activity to diffuse conflicts.  Children will be removed from the area if they are physically endangering themselves or others.
    parents are the most important adults in a child's life.  A respectful partnership between teachers and parents should be developed to provide for the best interests of the child

Each day is designed to provide constructive learning experiences through planned activity and individual attention. The activities include creative expression, simple nature experiments, time for conversation and indoor and outdoor play. This is a good formula for the development of inquisitive minds and the growth of healthy bodies. 

The program at Warsaw Wesleyan Wee Care Ministry will provide opportunities for your child to enjoy the accomplishment of memorizing Scripture, to participate in a variety of art projects, and to develop an appreciation for music. A solid foundation for future learning is presented at Wee Care through phonics, reading, writing, understanding numbers and their practical application to daily life, and the exploration of the world around us. 

Warsaw Wesleyan Wee Care Ministry provides a learning environment in which each child participates in a program designed to permit discovery and application for levels appropriate within their abilities. 

One of the key factors in the program's success is the Christian atmosphere created by a well-qualified and dedicated staff. Selection of staff is a top priority at Warsaw Wesleyan.

Because of her husband’s fondness for ducks he requested that the center be named Little Duckling. The center immediately began to grow and within two years she was running at full capacity. The demands for her services were so great that she had to turn parents away.

In order to accommodate demand Joyce decided to move the center to the church and register it as a daycare ministry where it continued to grow. For more than twenty years, Little Duckling has helped to raise and educate children and some of those same children we cared for as infants are now returning with their own children, remembering the quality of care they received.

This goal is best achieved in a loving, supportive environment where children are treated with respect and fairness.

Our philosophy on discipline is based on respect for the child.  The key to success for children is in preparing a supportive learning environment and using selective intervention to guide children in their behavior.  We believe that when the environment and activities are prepared, children can initiate their own play and exploration, and the need for teacher control is reduced. 

Our policy in helping in helping children gain self-control is to intervene and redirect energies before problems begin.  Our positive discipline approach consists of redirection, choices, consequences, warnings, supplying language, and problem-solving.  We cannot write enough guidelines to fit every child or situation.  Therefore, each child is treated as an individual, and parents are expected to work as partners with Destiny Christian Academy staff in helping the child practice self-discipline in the classroom. 

When an unacceptable behavior begins to occur at Destiny Christian Academy, the parents are asked to participate in a conference to develop a plan to correct the behavior in a positive way.  The plan will depend on the child and the situation. 

We recognize that children often respond to changes and situations they do not fully understand.  It is important that you keep Destiny Christian Academy staff informed of matters that may be affecting your child's behavior.  In this way, we can offer support when they are at our school. 

Our goal is to assist you in raising a happy, well-adjusted child.  We can accomplish this goal best through mutual respect and support.  We are confident that you, as a parent will give us that support.

Under that name, we spent more than a century building a reputation as Central Indiana’s standard-bearer for excellent child care. In 2014, Day Nursery changed its name to Early Learning Indiana, and our early childhood centers became known as Day Early Learning centers.

As Early Learning Indiana, our goal is to continue our tradition of being the area’s best source for child care services and resources, while embracing a larger role as an advocate and leading voice for early childhood education in Indiana. Our mission every day is to assure the highest quality early childhood education for children in Indiana.

Ideas and practices about child care have changed a great deal in the past one hundred years. Today, child care is about developmentally-appropriate learning for all ages, starting at infancy and carrying through to kindergarten age. At our Day Early Learning centers we care for and educate children ages 6 weeks through 6 years, all day, year round.";"http://www.earlylearningin.org/day-early-learning-centers/";"https://www.facebook.com/DayEarlyLearning";;"http://www.earlylearningin.org/about/employment";"http://www.earlylearningin.org/day-early-learning-centers/get-started/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.earlylearningin.org/wp-content/themes/earlylearningindiana/library/images/logo.svg";;;;;;

Vivian Cain, our founder and lead directress, opened the school in 2001. The Academy is located in a charming historical home built in the late 1800s that has been remodeled for Montessori educational use.

Our commitment to academic excellence is shown through our very extensive and enriched Montessori learning environment, low student-to-teacher ratios, and innovative approach to each child’s individual learning style. We appreciate and encourage global diversity in our school population: students, families, and staff.

Our curriculum reflects an awareness of the similarities and differences among people, language cultures, and religions. The basic Montessori philosophy of respect for every person is an important part of this commitment to diversity.

The Community Play School is designed to provide a child-centered and individualized arts-enriched program inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach.

Our philosophy is characterized by these developmental education principles:

- Children learn through play, interaction, problem solving, exploration, and discovery.
 

- Cooperation is more conducive to learning than competition.
 

- Children learn best when they can make choices and set their own goals.
 

- Each child is unique.
 

- Education is an on-going process which is enhanced when the child, teacher and family work together.

At the Community Play School we value a child’s right to a quality education that celebrates who he or she is, while providing tools to support ongoing emotional, intellectual, and creative growth. Our program is designed to deepen and enrich children’s encounters with the world, their community, and each other.

We are an affordable, community-based preschool dedicated to inclusion and diversity.

We engage, therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to walk together in Christian love; to strive for the advancement of the church, in knowledge and holiness; to give it a place in our affections, prayers & services above every organization of human origin; to sustain its worship, ordinances, discipline & doctrine; to contribute cheerfully & regularly, as God has prospered us, towards its expenses, for the support of a faithful & evangelical ministry among us, the relief of the poor and the spread of the Gospel throughout the world. In case of difference of opinion in the church, we will strive to avoid a contentious spirit, and if we cannot unanimously agree, we will cheerfully recognize the right of the majority to govern.

We also engage to maintain family & secret devotion; to study diligently the word of God; to religiously educate our children, to seek the salvation of our kindred and acquaintance; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be kind & just to those in our employ, & faithful in the service we promised others; endeavoring in the purity of heart & good will towards all men to exemplify and commend our holy faith.

We further engage to watch over, to pray for, to exhort & to stir up each other unto every good word & work; to guard each other's reputation, not needlessly exposing the infirmities of others; to participate in each other's joys, and with tender sympathy bear one another's burdens & sorrows; to cultivate Christian courtesy; to be slow to give or take offense, but always ready for reconciliation, being mindful of the rules of the Savior in the 18th chapter of Matthew, to secure it without delay; and through life, amid evil report, & good report to seek to live to the glory of God, who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.

When we remove from this place, we engage as soon as possible to unite with some other church where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the principles of God's word.

Lutheran Schools comprise the largest Protestant parochial school system in the country. Baltimore Lutheran Middle and Upper School and over two dozen parish schools of sister congregations in Baltimore are a part of this system.  Calvary opened in 1949 with a kindergarten at Park Drive and Creighton Avenue followed by first grade in 1954.  One grade a year was added until the school reached six grades and a kindergarten in 1959.  The present school building was dedicated in 1957 and in 1969, four classrooms were added so all classes could be housed under one roof as it is today. Keeping up with trends in education, Calvary congregation elected to add a pre-kindergarten for 4-year olds in 1972. Calvary became state/accredited approved school by the Maryland State Department of Education in 1984.  In 1987, the school expanded and added a pre-school program for 3-year olds.  An extended care program was added in 1989 to accommodate school families who needed before/after school care. In 1999, the kindergarten program was expanded to a full day program and in 2000, the 6th grade was eliminated. The school formed an Alumni/School Development Association (SDA) in 2007 and the school has been continuously in operation for more than 60 years.

You’ll be a part of the entire community and the J.

  Our Facilities  
Your child’s journey begins in one of our warm and inviting classrooms. Along with our expert teaching staff, your child  will have access to all that the J has to offer including a full-sized gymnasium, teaching kitchen, outdoor play areas, and indoor pools, where each child (ages 3+) receives American Red Cross Certified instructional swim lessons.

  Our Week  
Your child will be exposed to group activities and one-on-one interactions while also having multiple opportunities for exploratory, child-directed play. Each week, we will celebrate Shabbat and learn about Jewish culture and values. We will also introduce your child to science, math, and literature in our classrooms and libraries. Each child learns through play, participating in music, art, nature, cooking, and dance.

  Our Teachers  
At the core of our program are excellent teachers who understand that the early years of life are the most critical in forming a child’s opinion of himself or herself. Our staff’s goal is to create an enriched environment full of excitement and encouragement. As a result every child develops a love of learning and a feeling of self-worth as an individual and as a member of a group. The teachers put theory into practice recognizing that each child enters the classroom with a unique set of skills, strengths, and needs. That’s why we  individualize our teaching styles to meet the needs of each and every child. We consider ourselves to be partners with our parents.  Enhancing your child’s confidence  and curiosity through creative engagement is what we do – everyday! 

  Healthy Choices  
Our Healthy Choices curriculum has been recognized by Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! Child Care Initiative for Exceptional Work in the Prevention of Childhood Obesity. This program teaches children ages 2 to 5 about the importance of eating fruits and vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins.  Every week our students have the opportunity to taste new foods like kale, quinoa, and kiwi. Daily physical activity also serves as a critical component of this program.

On the site is the historic Jacob Seddon House, likely the oldest building in Perry Hall.  Honeygo Child Development Center was founded in 1992 by Jim and Ramona Casserly.  It began operation in 1994.  It is the belief of Mr. & Mrs. Casserly that the best place for children to develop is in the home with a parent or grandparent.  However, given the needs of modern life this is not always possible.  Therefore, they have sought to provide the best possible alternative; a place where children are nurtured and feel safe that looks and feels like a family home.  The Casserly’s are active owners thoroughly involved with the daily operation and are familiar with the children and their families so that they can support their individual need in a way that only a single center operation can do.

The day also includes outdoor play with one week of swimming at the academy. This is supervised by a life guard and staff.

The Lycée Rochambeau is the only school in Washington DC and its surroundings to provide an education based on the French programs, and welcomes students from the Toute Petite Section preschool class (2yr old) to senior year, students from fifty different nationalities and all cultural, socioeconomic and linguistic backgrounds.

This extraordinary diversity is an asset that we are quite proud of! Our students understand from an early age that differences and otherness are the richness of the world and as many great sources of discovery and personal enrichment.

At the crossroads of French and American cultures, we further increased the value of our academic and educational approach by integrating the best of the American approach in terms of self development, autonomy and responsibility building, self-trust and creativity.

By giving our students the access to a Maryland High School Diploma as well as a French Baccalaureat, this unique education opens for them the doors of Francophone and Anglophone colleges and universities around the world.

The new 22,000 gross square foot center will be located on the southeast side of the NIH campus, east of the Natcher Bldg. and north of Center Drive.

The interior layout of the new center will incorporate the latest child care amenities such as cable and computer connectivity, skylights, built-in lofts within classrooms, a multi-purpose room and a full service kitchen. The facility will have a fan-shape design that will allow for direct access from each of the five new large classrooms to a playground. The exterior of the facility will be constructed in light-colored stone similar to the Natcher Bldg., with large green-tinted windows. The groundbreaking for construction is set for late December 1999 or early January 2000.

The NIH Preschool has resided on the NIH campus in Bldg. 35 since June 1973 and was established through the efforts of parents and other NIH employees to offer high quality care to children of NIH'ers. Many employees are familiar with the little day care program located in the 1-story building near Old Georgetown Rd. that originally began with 18 children and through the years has grown to the present capacity of 65 children, ages 2 to 5 years. The program received recognition in 1997 from the quality of work life committee for its efforts and dedication toward improving the quality of work life for NIH employees.

The new center has been designed to accommodate the NIH Preschool's current enrollment of 65 children and provides an additional 35 spaces, bringing total enrollment capacity to 100 children. The program will be designed to accommodate four preschool classes and one accredited kindergarten program. The new center will be recertified by the Maryland state board of education as a nonpublic program - nursery school and accredited kindergarten. The program will also be reaccredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children and the state child care administration.

    are welcomed.
       We encourage parents to be open and let us know if any changes are
    required.



Supported by our curriculum especially designed under the lime light of
the Montessori system, children are taught in a low pressure environment.

Children will develop all skills that will help them in their future academic
success.

We emphasize cognitive skills like with sequencing, matching, art,
language, and story telling.

Music, movement, and dance is a part of our program.

We, at Bobbie's Learning Center, offer lots of opportunity to our children to
establish a lifelong learning.

The trained staff at our center has designed a very strong curriculum and
they plan activities that encourage young infants, toddlers and
preschoolers to eagerly investigate the world around them.

During the hours of operation, our classroom has lots of creative arts,
jigsaw puzzles, blocks, and imaginary play.  Also, our small library always
has lots of books for discovery.

We go outside twice everyday and have lots of outdoor activities like
jumping and running.  The children get to use different outdoor equipment.

Finger play and songs are incorporated into each day to foster a child's
world around them.

Children are encouraged to practice putting away their belongings, picking
up their toys and sharing with other children.

Children are encouraged to differentiate between good and bad manners.

Our program for infants includes a nursery which has been designed as a
warm, loving, and caring environment.

Once they came into our care, they will be surrounded by love and
affection.  The nursery is designed to create a warm and secure
environment for infants and young toddlers, and is full of stimulating toys.  
We sing them songs, read them stories, hold them, and cuddle them to
instill trust, security and provide comfort and happiness.

We would love parents to work with us to ensure consistency in their
infant's schedule between home and Bobbie's Learning Center.

Each infant has their own crib, sheets, and covers.  We try to have their
own toys, as much as possible, to avoid contamination.";"http://bobbiesdaycare.com/";;"7:00 AM - 6:00 PM";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://bobbiesdaycare.com/sitebuilder/images/index.html-0.png";;;;;;

The children are given the opportunity to develop a sense of mastery through their own accomplishments.  This promotes the building of self-esteem and a strong self-worth.

These efforts are supported by the integral involvement of the families in our school community.

I am in awe of the rich, diverse community that includes Northwestern and our feeder schools Hyattsville and Nicholas Orem Middle. I am looking forward to working with our World Class students and educators and inspiring them to be Great by Choice!

I am no stranger to Prince Georges County. I taught Spanish at Largo High School over 10 years ago, my family and I live in the county, and my daughter has attended a Prince George’s County School since kindergarten. I return to work in the county partly because my daughter’s schooling helped me realize what a great school system we have and also because I am committed to providing the highest quality education possible in a safe and supportive learning environment through collaboration with our staff, parents, and community.  I truly believe that education does not take place in a vacuum.  Our success is dependent upon the input, support, and involvement from all of our stakeholders. We are only as strong as each member of our team and each member is equally as important as the next.

At Northwestern High School, World Class Teachers and Staff are preparing our World Class Students to be College and Career Ready. I love this mantra that was introduced to me on my very first day of school. I would like to add our World Class Community without whom we cannot be successful. I am very passionate about collaboration inside and outside of our school house. I will be spending a considerable amount of time engaging with all of our stakeholders to advance our agenda to improve Attendance, Achievement, Instruction, and Matriculations; the 4 Big Rocks that are the cornerstone of our work at Northwestern.";"http://www1.pgcps.org/northwestern/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www1.pgcps.org/northwestern/imagesx/nwhsheader.jpg";;;;;;

Provide quality childcare in an environment that promotes the growth and development of the whole child.
At DCI, we believe each child is unique.  We are committed to helping each child develop cognitively, socially, physically, emotionally, and creatively.  We also realize that children are not empty vessels to be filled with knowledge, but are active participants in the acquisition of knowledge.  To this end, we provide a safe, clean, and developmentally appropriate environment that encourages children to explore and grow.  Our teachers develop activities and experiences that will inspire children to learn through discovery and play.  Our goal is to help children reach their full potential.
Although we are known as an early childhood development center, we recognize that parents/guardians are the most important people in a child's life.  With this in mind, we believe in working hard encouraging parents/guardians to take an active role in their child's education.  When a child comes into our center, we believe in not only enrolling the child, but we enroll his/her family as well.";"http://www.daycareinc.net/contact";;"Mon-Fri: 6:30 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Our lesson plans have a detailed activity for fine motor, gross motor, cognitive, and language skills.

Our educated infant teachers schedule daily one-on-one time with each child, which is noted and given to the parent at the end of each day. This gives the parent a detailed report on what your infant is learning and also the progress they updated on all new developments with the infant. The conferences also allow the parents to have an input with forming their child�s curriculum. Along with our wonderful curriculum we have an amazing music program specifically for our infants! We partner with the school for the arts to introduce a different genre of music and musical instruments through a mix of children�s songs, dance, and books put to music!";"https://www.thumbtack.com/md/baltimore/preschools/daycare-center";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

Soon thereafter, the Co-operative Preschool opened its doors for three and four year olds.  The Preschool ministered to between fifty and sixty families each year, many of whom were members of New Covenant Presbyterian Church.  That was only the beginning!  God had planted the desire for quality Christian education into the hearts of His people at NCPC!

In 1997 the Pastor of New Covenant established a committee of congregants to determine the need and feasability of starting a classical Christian school in Harford County. After a great deal of prayer and support from the church family, New Covenant Christian School opened its doors to seven kindergarteners and five first grade students in September of 1999.  

By the end of the second year, our numbers had tripled!  The School continued to grow, adding two additional classrooms in the back of the sanctuary. In 2001, we added a brand new educational wing and a gym!  Adding one grade each year, we grew from preschool to eighth grade and reached our building capacity.

In 2007, the NCCS Upper School began renting classroom and chapel space at Calvary Baptist Church in Bel Air.  We moved to a larger facility at Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd (LCGS) two years later, where the Upper School is currently located. 

We now have two campuses, 200+ students, and more than 40 staff members!

Children need to feel secure and cared for at all times. The Center provides a loving environment that enables children to feel safe, thereby freeing them to be open and eager to learn.

We believe that the learning process for any child begins at birth. Children are eager to learn and parental involvement in this learning process is very important. Parents and teachers must be united in their efforts to encourage the child to reach his/her fullest potential.

We believe modeling is a very decisive form of teaching. Children look for role models; therefore, we must be people of integrity; loyal, kind, patient, hardworking and loving. We believe our lifestyle must be reflective of attributes that would encourage positive behavior in our learners.

We believe that when you “Train up a child in the way he should go when he is old he will not depart from it.” Proverbs 22:6

*The Hundred Languages of Children*
Throughout the learning process, children are encouraged to depict their understanding in one of many symbolic ""languages"" - including drawing, sculpture, dramatic play & re-telling, writing, and designing. Graphic representation is one of the key ways that teachers have a “window” into the learning process of young children. Children take part in long-term projects - the Project Approach - with daily opportunities to explore and modify individual and cooperative work.

*Parents & Teachers as Learners*
We will include parents and volunteers in many of our activities including nature walks and culminating activities that contextualize what we have learned so far.";"https://www.facebook.com/CatoctinSunNaturePreschool/info?tab=milestone";"https://www.facebook.com/CatoctinSunNaturePreschool/info?tab=milestone";;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"https://scontent-hkg3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/10373821_934676246549279_6745501510412993120_n.jpg?oh=2af2b92c39e47f7f7c1dd4f69fb23940&oe=561539C7";;;;;;

    -Dr. Maria Montessori 

The first period of human development, from 0 to 6, is the most important because it is the time when the child's character and intelligence are being formed. The child has creative energies which are being used to develop a mind with the ability to think, understand, and remember.

Montessori recognizes in the child a natural curiosity and desire to learn. Independence, self-cofidence, self-discipline, and a love of learning are characteristics that are developed in the Montessori classroom. Movement is of primary importance. The child is able to learn by doing, moving about freely and working with the mary educational materials available to him.

Children learn at different rates. Therefore, in our Montessori classroom the children are able to work indepenently at their own pace. Each child has ""sensitive periods"" of learning when there is an intense interest in learning a particular skill. Based on these sensitive periods, your child will be able to choose and work with Montessori materials which will aid him in his mental development and self-construction.";"http://www.theganmontessori.com/";;;;"http://www.theganmontessori.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/1726041/jewish/Admissions.htm";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.theganmontessori.com/media/images/730/UBzk7306549.jpg";;;;;;

While we have fun in nurturing and caring for your little ones, we would love for you to visit our center with your child so you can not only get to tour around our classroom facilities and play areas, but also personally meet our dedicated team of teachers.";"http://www.immanuels.org/index.php/ministries/childcare-center";;;;"http://www.immanuels.org/images/stories/pdf/ICC/ICC_APPLICATION-2013-14.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.immanuels.org/images/stories/general-images/ICC-logo-new.png";;;;;;

They wanted a program where their children were well supervised, active, and entertained. The result was Kids Adventures.

Greg, a father of 5 children, majored in Education at Louisiana State University. He has worked in Montgomery County Schools and directed high adventure and summer day camps for the past 14 years. He is currently a Boy Scout leader, volunteers with a teen organization for his church, and coaches youth basketball, baseball, & football.

Cathey, a working mother, majored in General Business at Louisiana State University. In addition to raising 5 wonderful children, she has been involved in teaching and organizing youth programs, youth conferences, summer camps and child care programs. She is actively involved in the PTA, and served as a Brownie Leader for the GSA.

Brian Rindos, a graduate of the University of Maryland, has directed summer and school-year programs in Montgomery County for the past 16 years. It is his belief that including children and families in the planning process will lead to a more enjoyable experience for everyone. Brian is a member of the Montgomery County Interagency Coordinating Board Committee for Excellence in Child Care as well as being an active member with a number of pediatric and adolescent health organizations.

Three of Greg and Cathey’s children have grow up through the Kids Adventures programs and have each worked in the program as older teens and adults. Through their positive experiences working in Kids Adventures, two have chosen to study education and become full time teachers.

The staff is the driving force behind what goes on at Kids Adventures. They are a diverse group of individuals brought together by their common goal to give your child an experience they’ll never forget. Kids Adventures staff is made up of school teachers, college graduates, college and high school students, as well as child care professionals with varying levels of education and training to ensure a proper fit with your child. Our staff strives to create a safe environment that promotes the growth of each camper/student as an individual.
