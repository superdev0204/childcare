ASEP offers exciting activities which stimulate children to be healthier and happier, including sports, art activities and computer exploration. After School Enrichment Programs operate in CMS schools, utilizing age-appropriate materials and equipment for students. From the media center to the playground, students spend out-of-school hours in safe and stimulating environments. Using a curriculum correlated with the Common Core and Essential Standards, ASEP Site Coordinators, school administrators and teachers work together to ensure their ASEP programs supplement the learning taking place during the school day.

Besides academic support, the ASEP program focuses on the development of students’ social skills. To see After School at a glance click on the ASEP Fact Sheet. Program leaders are respectful and positive toward students, mindful of the importance of appropriate role models. Students are encouraged to develop friendships with schoolmates that for some will last many years.

Children learn best by doing, and play is the serious work of childhood.  At Noah's Ark Learning Center, children sing, paint
and cook.  They perform puppet shows, dress up, and transform blocks into ships and castles, houses and trains.  Becoming fully engaged in imaginative play is the child’s best foundation and preparation for learning.

Daily activities are open-ended so that each child may explore possibilities and experiment with materials without adult determined models.  The activities are teacher guided with child selection.  Verbal expression of thoughts and feelings is encouraged during circle time, small groups, meal times and play times.  Children play outdoors at least twice daily during the year on a mulched, fenced play yard with outdoor equipment, including climbing structures, bikes, swings, and sand play.

We believe children “learn by doing” and have set up an exciting indoor and outdoor learning environment for children to explore.  Classrooms have learning centers with materials that provide a wide range of experiences in all skill areas.  The goal of our curriculum, which is based on the Maryland Model for School Readiness and approved
by the Maryland State Department of Education, encourages children to develop socially, emotionally, physically,
intellectually, and spiritually.";"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Noahs-Ark-Learning-Center-Inc-Noahs-Ark-Too/481186568577980";"6am-6pm";;"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/files/Noah_s_Ark_Application-UPDATED.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/sitebuilder/images/Noah_s_Ark_II2-182x106.jpg";"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/images/IMG_2477.jpeg";"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/sitebuilder/images/ScannedImage008-320x202.jpg";"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/sitebuilder/images/ScannedImage001-322x203.jpg";"http://www.noahsarklearningcenter.com/sitebuilder/images/Babies_024-165x231.jpg";;

We maintain a superior  rating from the  Alamance County Health  Department.  F.A.C.B. is licensed  for children birth  through 12 years of age.  Presently we  are enrolling children ages two through five year of age.   We provide a full day from 7:30 am until 5:30 pm daily Monday through Friday.

This includes breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack.
We work with  the children at their pace in a fun and loving atmosphere.  We help them learn to recognize the alphabets, as well as  the phonics of the alphabets, along with their colors and shapes.  We introduce them to simple math problems that include addition and subtraction.

We provide our parent  with a yearly schedule which includes all holidays, vacation, and or personal days for the year so they can plan accordingly.

F.A.C.B. has a yearly graduation  as well as a Christmas Program with a “Pot Luck” dinner following.  This allows parent to share their special recipes as well as get to know the parent  of the other children.

When your child is enrolled you will receive along with the child care application a parent handbook that has all the  information you will need ( including a daily schedule) to make enrolling your child  a pleasant experience at F.A.C.B.

We read a lot here and the children are reading, writing their names and numbers daily.  They can identify verbs, nouns, pronouns, and adjectives.   They are also familiar with their basic punctuations such as the question mark, period, comma, and the exclamation mark.  ( This is done with a fun  and  exciting game called “Choose One” where I write several sentences and they have to pick the correct  felt punctuation and place it at the end of the sentence.) In addition they are  taught to use their imagination and to be creative with their art work as well as during “Story Drama”. (That is when I start a story line and everyone has to add to it.)  Keep in mind everything we do is fun based.   If you want your children to excel when they enter kindergarten please allow me to teach them.

Math is also taught through the use of these same strategies as well as the hands-on exploration of concepts and problem solving using manipulatives.
    Many extra-curricular opportunities are offered to our students such as, Odyssey of the Mind, Battle of the Books, Science Fair, Safety Patrol, Technology Club, Family Dances, Strings Instruction, Spelling Bee participation, and Writing Contests.

Research has confirmed that children do their most important learning in the early childhood years before the age of five.

In addition to a warm and nurturing environment, attention is paid to the age-appropriateness of each classroom environment. Children are viewed as unique and valuable and attention is paid to their individual thoughts, skills, needs and interests. Creative Day School strives to build a foundation upon which each child can develop a strong sense of self worth that will carry through to adulthood.

Through nurturing and individualized attention, we take great care to provide a warm, friendly, and fun environment for your child, while ensuring they receive the guidance and structure they need. We strive to nurture your child's ideas and imagination, acknowledge each child's individuality, and validate each personality.
 
Our goal is to provide a place where children know that they are accepted, loved, protected, and wanted; helping to instill in each child a strong sense of self-worth and purpose. Our job is to make sure that each child has numerous positive experiences and interactions throughout each day. It is our hope that when the day is done, and children go home, they feel happy and proud of themselves; eager to express the happenings of their day to you. Each and every day we feel privileged to have the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a child, to join in their laughter, and to be included in their games. This is how we have chosen to spend our days. We are very tolerant individuals with an enormous amount of patience. This coupled with our love for children makes us nurturing childcare providers. We understand how difficult it must be to leave your child in someone else's care. Because of this, we can appreciate the trust you must put in us on a daily basis. Therefore, our goal is to build your trust by being professional, dependable, honest, and most importantly caring for your child the same way we would want our own children to be cared for. We view our chosen profession as a career, not as just a job. Therefore, we look forward to keeping children smiling and safe for many years to come. We feel that good communication between parent and provider is a very important part of a quality daycare. Because of this, we are committed to creating a strong bond with you and your child, helping to ensure the best start to your child's life. Our goal is that you feel completely confident and reassured when you leave your child in our care. Each child is different, unique, and special and will be treated as such. These carefree years are far too short. Therefore, we do not rush children through this fun filled time in their lives. Rather, each child is encouraged to develop and grow at their own pace. We understand that you are trusting us to care for your child, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We look forward to the opportunity to care for your child, while providing a positive influence in their life.

During the year 2011-2012 two iPad carts were purchased to provide our students and teachers with easy access to a multitude of web resources.  Currently each 3rd-6th grade level has their own laptop cart, iPad carts are gradually being distributed to specific grade levels, and a new leveled library has been added to increase literacy among each Rebel at North Duplin Elementary! 
 
In 2008-9, North Duplin Elementary adopted the theme, We Are Wild About Learning!, where the school media center and hallways were transformed with murals embracing the ""wild"" theme.  Students and guests are greeted by lions, giraffes, elephants and other wild creatures where the theme is incorporated at every grade level.  In addition, our school has received several health initiative grants, benefiting our students with a rock wall, roller blades, and even bicycles!

The Murphy Adventist Christian School family exists to show children Jesus, nurture their love for Him and others, teach them to think, and empower them to serve.

Our Philosophy
The Murphy Adventist Christian School is operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to provide a spiritually oriented education for children. A belief in the existence of the Creator God is fundamental in the philosophy of Seventh-day Adventist schools. We respect His divine authority and recognize His intervention in human affairs. We believe that true education develops the spiritual, mental, and physical powers of each student; preparing them for the joy of service in this life and for the higher joy of service in the life to come. To achieve this goal, we encourage each student to:

    develop a personal relationship with God and his fellow men as stated in Matthew 2:37-39
    master the basic academic skills
    value labor, physical and mental, as the blessing God intended
    cultivate physical fitness, mental ability, and moral purity as the blessing God intended.

The Murphy Adventist Christian School operates in harmony with the guidance and direction of the Office of Education, North American Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.";"http://www.murphyadventistchristianschool.com/";"murphyadventistschool@yahoo.com";;"murphyadventistschool@yahoo.com";"http://antfd7.adventistschoolconnect.org/article/5/registration-forms";"http://antfd7.adventistschoolconnect.org/site/1/docs/Handbook%20revised%202012.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";;"http://www.murphyadventistchristianschool.com/site/1/images/School_Bldg_4-09.JPG";"http://antfd7.adventistschoolconnect.org/site/1/images/thirdgrade2.jpg";;;;

ASEP offers exciting activities which stimulate children to be healthier and happier, including sports, art activities and computer exploration. After School Enrichment Programs operate in CMS schools, utilizing age-appropriate materials and equipment for students. From the media center to the playground, students spend out-of-school hours in safe and stimulating environments. Using a curriculum correlated with the Common Core and Essential Standards, ASEP Site Coordinators, school administrators and teachers work together to ensure their ASEP programs supplement the learning taking place during the school day.

Besides academic support, the ASEP program focuses on the development of students’ social skills. To see After School at a glance click on the ASEP Fact Sheet. Program leaders are respectful and positive toward students, mindful of the importance of appropriate role models. Students are encouraged to develop friendships with schoolmates that for some will last many years.

Our first priority is to be more than just a daycare -- from every aspect of our classrooms to each of our three different playgrounds, we ensure children and parents feel safe, confident and happy, while in our care.

Our supportive learning environment is an academic based program where children learn from our highly skilled teachers using practices in early childhood education. We hold a high bar for our teachers who have earned degrees in Early Childhood Education (or similar), or are in the process of completion. Through themed unit lessons, we meet target areas of development, including Language, Cognitive, Sensory, Imaginative, Problem Solving and Social Development, in a fun and exciting manner. At All Star Learning Center, we have earned our motto: ""Where learning together is fun!"".

Learning can't be anything but fun, naturally interesting and inspiring, when you look at each classroom set-up. Opportunities for each area of development are enriched through various activities: dramatic play, quiet book nooks, and art. Activities are also taught in science and nature, music and rhythm, and sand and water.

We participate in the Healthy FUNdamentals Program to ensure each child receives a healthy breakfast, lunch and snack, and has an opportunity to exercise in fun and play throughout the day. Our facility meets the highest state standards while providing clean, bright, open and safe learning and play areas.

Telamon operates three types of Head Start programs for disadvantaged families: Head Start (preschool for children ages 3 to 5 years old), Early Head Start (childcare for children 0 to 3 years old and pregnant women), and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (childcare and preschool for children of eligible farmworkers ages 0 to 5 years old). Children with disabilities are encouraged to participate in all programs. Telamon’s approach to Head Start services includes:

    A nurturing environment that supports the healthy growth and development of each child in the context of the child's family, culture, and community
    Parents as partners in the shared decision-making process and as active participants in policy groups; and
    Recognition of the importance of strengthening linkages within communities.

Our Head Start programs offer a variety of service models, depending on the needs of families in each community.  Head Start centers provide a secure setting where children can develop their skills under the watchful eyes of well-trained caregivers.  Partial or full-day services at centers include health and dental screenings, nutritious meals, individual as well as group learning experiences, play opportunities and other structured activities. All services and materials are designed to be age and developmentally appropriate as well as sensitive to the cultural and language environment of a child's home. Parents are included in program planning and oversight activities.

Some programs are based in the children’s own home, where staff visit once a week to provide services to the child and family. Children and families who receive these services gather periodically with other enrolled families for a group learning experience facilitated by Telamon staff.";"http://www.telamon.org/north-carolina-head-start.aspx";;;"http://www.telamon.org/employment-training.aspx";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.telamon.org/images/top/telamon-logo.png";;;;;;

Activities are carefully planned and implemented in an open-classroom setting.  Children are free to choose from age appropriate activities including art, music, language development, pre-math skills, science and nature, and dramatic play.  Children develop self-esteem, independence and problem-solving skills as they make choices and assist in planning the environment and the activities.

 Our primary goal is for children to feel safe and secure.  Prior to being independent a child must know that he or she can depend on adults and a predictable environment.  Children are treated with respect and kindness.  We recognize that children develop at different rates and have different interest. Small group size and appropriate teacher-child ratios allow for meeting the individual needs of each child.  

 Learning and playing are not limited to the classrooms.  Children participate in the outdoor environment each day.  The Center provides age appropriate playgrounds.  Infants are also taken outside for walks in a stroller or in the arms of a teacher.  ";"http://www.angels301.com/#!about1/c1z94";;"5:30 a.m. to 6:00p.m.";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";;;;;;;

We provide services for children ages 3-5 in an inclusive setting.  The Bryan site (910-671-4343) in Lumberton is located next to the PSRC Planetarium. The Pembroke site (910-521-0559) is located on the campus of the Indian Education Resource Center adjacent to UNCP.

Our Program offers enrichment and educational activities similar to other inclusive preschools; in addition, Shining Stars provides therapeutic services and a strong family and community involvement component.  Special Education Instruction is provided by teachers licensed by the state of North Carolina.  Identified exceptional children receive their services in the inclusive setting. Related services (i.e. speech, physical therapy, occupational therapy, hearing impaired therapy and visually impaired therapy) are offered at our two sites as well as various centers and homes throughout our county.

The Shining Stars Day Care program is nationally accredited and holds a five-star license from the Division of Child Development under the North Carolina Department of Heath and Human Services. Our program is also the contract agent for the More at Four state initiative, serving at-risk four year old children within Robeson County. Children who qualify for More at Four are served in classrooms all over Robeson County in private day cares, school classrooms, Head Start and at the Shining Stars Centers.

Shining Stars is also very proud of our Preschool on Wheels. This Program is another alternative to have services provided in a high quality environment for children age’s three to five. Parents and families have the option to have their children served in this setting. It is our goal and purpose at Shining Stars to provide each child enrolled with a safe, clean, and loving environment.

Our Programs strongly encourage and reinforce self-esteem, self-control and self-respect as well as implementing many quality activities that positively influence growth in a child's physical, mental, emotional and social skills with caring and dedicated staff members.";"http://www.robeson.k12.nc.us/Page/31072";;"8:00 - 5:00";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.robeson.k12.nc.us/cms/lib6/NC01000307/Centricity/Template/4/logos/robeson.png";;;;;;

Besides academic support, the ASEP program focuses on the development of students’ social skills. To see After School at a glance click on the ASEP Fact Sheet.

Our student population consists of PreK-5.  We are located in Pinnacle, North Carolina. Our mascot is the Panther and our school colors are blue and white. At Pinnacle Elementary we strive to put children first.

We have been recognized by the state of NC as a Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (P.B.I.S.) school at the Exemplar Level. The major components are        1. Identify the expected behaviors.  
2. Teach model and practice what those behaviors look, sound, and feel like. 
3. Specifically praise appropriate behavior with private or public acknowledgement.  

Our instructional emphasis is child-centered. Children learn through life applicable experiences using a balanced literacy curriculum, math manipulatives, hands-on science, and other activities which involve active learning.

In order to meet children’s individual needs, we have teachers specializing in speech, academically gifted, and learning disabilities. All students attend guidance, music, physical education, media, and computer classes once per week instructed by teachers certified in these areas. We also have a computer lab available for students’ use and at least two computers in each classroom. The computers operate on a school-wide network which provides numerous technological opportunities, including wireless Internet.

In addition to classroom academics, some of the opportunities available to students are Student Council,  Math Stars, Junior Battle of the Books, Reading Counts, Jr. Blast, and quarterly award ceremonies in which students are recognized for academic and behavioral success. Students are rewarded monthly for meeting homework and behavior goals. 

Our Parent Teacher Organization is an integral part of our total school program. Each year the P.T.O. sponsors many fun-filled events for our students and the community. Proceeds from these activities in the past have been used to purchase computers, playground equipment, and numerous instructional supplies. In addition, the P.T.O. provides volunteers for classroom activities, tutoring, and many other services. We believe educating children is a joint effort between home and school. We highly value and encourage parental involvement.

The faculty and staff at Pinnacle Elementary School strive to provide a quality education for students.

In order to make a difference in a child’s life outcome, we know we must provide support to the family. Our primary responsibility to the family is providing the best possible childcare. Secondly, we must be a resource and referral when a family has a need, and when necessary we must become personally involved to help bring about successful resolutions to problems.

McLauchlin is a small school nestled in the heart of historic downtown Raeford located in the Sandhills region of southeastern North Carolina.  We are centrally located between Southern Pines and Fayetteville and also share a border with Ft. Bragg and Pope Air Force Base resulting in a large military population.

           Our county is a rural, agricultural community complemented by several major industries: House of Raeford, Unilever and Tar-heel Turkey Hatchery. Local churches and community organizations support us in our efforts to provide a quality education for our students.

           J.W. McLauchlin was originally built in 1917.  The top floor of the school burned in 1965. The present facility was completed in 1966. We are the only school located in the downtown district of Raeford.

            We are SACS accredited and we use the latest forms of technology such as Class works in our computer lab, Smart Boards in our classrooms and research-based programs to enhance learning such as Reading First, P.E., Art, Music and Library.

           Our faculty and staff work together cooperatively to promote a caring environment in which all students experience success.  Our students are interesting, eager and ready to learn. As a result of this desire to learn, we have continued to show academic progress. 

           We continue to strive to instill in each child an even greater desire to learn, with the goal being to develop our students into productive, caring members of our society and be competitive in the 21st century work force.";"https://sites.google.com/a/hcs.k12.nc.us/j-w-mclauchlin-elementary/";;;;;"https://sites.google.com/a/hcs.k12.nc.us/j-w-mclauchlin-elementary/parent-resources/parent-and-student-handbook";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"https://sites.google.com/a/hcs.k12.nc.us/j-w-mclauchlin-elementary/_/rsrc/1373096918470/config/customLogo.gif?revision=26";"https://sites.google.com/a/hcs.k12.nc.us/j-w-mclauchlin-elementary/_/rsrc/1400860774449/Home/image.jpeg?height=300&width=400";"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wmAeowXYMsA/UdTnZrzFHnI/AAAAAAAAAPw/r49VpDPnv0g/s400/IMG_1788.JPG";"https://fb01fb22-a-2e34f79a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/hcs.k12.nc.us/j-w-mclauchlin-elementary/photo-gallery/IMG_20131002_112852_391.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7cr6v-B7CXMrhcT2JY6u57Ye2Qi2fMf5VTc-0MlhoRm9EGJUAvkhml8fRu1ukdBppMv8DdNtWDU9mIOZRxZiOTZPBnDYaJWog0PtUzYkWbVuBF9jL_KXNGhTN0NBIElikbKEVPdv85MZI867R9oHil3UreTE7PJro81i9GMgmo9x7w-70mLPhhTmNGzKzpoosIFBL9_D8nYwp6xoE3psiPqJmZfo0kKkozNrJeatVvbzHYW_RgppBNjCZi3yCwkI8YzOdmYaWL4DMrTAChg1n78DJ4dD5w%3D%3D&attredirects=0";"https://fb01fb22-a-2e34f79a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/hcs.k12.nc.us/j-w-mclauchlin-elementary/photo-gallery/photo%203.JPG?attachauth=ANoY7cpgB-FTyDeu6aB0NHD6xx1NXcHw4Rzw8s0sqCaIkO2kjlsVE1jss5BMAo5XEOQg3poXca1cRC81tCPzf1ttlv7Bukn0Ha9wNiNd5sM4TLrpVhP3WeKJu3cmWjakE3fFWJG5MS6e6SbQwJ8wg10ckewvmA62zrkGJoRnVff0yxcWJNyG0uykHMlAf8eTIsWVJ5LAZJ4s8LpRv7ElSkWzu4EQ7HYXJRzDfUemGu9NtFMJK7KL2Fw7zcp01_wp_SYLXAjWJCf7&attredirects=0";;

It is time for students, parents and staff to embark upon a journey that will lead to high academic achievement for all our students.

Our “Five Principles” were created for each aspect of the educational community as the GPS to increasing student achievement and ensuring that our students are prepared for the next level.

Building on our historical beginnings, the center is committed to serving children from a variety of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, and to cultivate its strength through diversity.

We are very proud of the commitment the CDC teachers have shown to the children and families that we serve. The longevity of our staff speaks volumes about their commitment to early childhood education. The average length of service for our teachers is 18 years. We currently have one teacher that has been employed by the CDC for over 35 years!";"http://esumc.org/connect/children/child-development-center/";;"7:15 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday";;"http://esumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CDC-WaitingListApplication.pdf";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://esumc.org/wp-content/themes/ESUMC/library/images/Edenton-Street-United-Methodist-Church.png";"http://esumc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/owls-520x210.jpg";;;;;

It is a non-profit organization, founded by five area churches, which formed the Raleigh Inter-Church Housing Corporation (RICH). It began operations in the Method community of Raleigh with seventeen children, two staff members, and many talented volunteers. Method was organized to serve children from all socioeconomic backgrounds and proudly continues that tradition.

In 2004, Method changed it's name to Method Child Development Center and moved from Pullen Baptist Church to its current facility at 900 Trailwood Drive in Raleigh, NC. Today, Method serves children six weeks through school age. The Center operates six classrooms (infant, toddler, two, three, four, five, and after-school).

Positive guidance uses redirection, verbalization of misunderstandings, consistency, and acceptance of feelings, firmness, and fairness.  Children are encouraged to express their feelings verbally as well as to discuss and resolve conflicts rather than 'act out' their feelings. In certain situations, a brief 'quiet time' may be used to allow a child to calm down and recover self-control before resuming group activities. This time is limited to no more than one minute per year of the child's age.

Our center is committed to excellence for young children and their families. We provide a safe and caring environment that promotes learning and child development. Learning is facilitated through play and supported by qualified, positive role models. The activities are stimulating and age appropriate. They help children foster creativity, build self esteem and self confidence, promote independence, encourage exploration, and develop school readiness skills. Children receive daily balanced meals according to USDA guidelines, and receive dental, vision, hearing and speech screening and evaluations as needed.

Our teachers are highly qualified and have a Birth-Kindergarten teaching license issued by North Carolina Department of Public Instructions. The teacher assistants have a Bachelor of Science or an Applied Associate Degree in Early Childhood Education and working towards a Birth-Kindergarten license.

To function in the “global village” of the 21st century, our children are provided choices that will influence their future. They will appreciate the values of diversity, acceptance and inclusion, while being responsible for their own behaviors.

Underwood GT Magnet Elementary School is a beautiful school built in 1926 nestled in the heart of Raleigh ’s historic Five Points neighborhood. With around 500 students we maintain a community atmosphere while delivering an exciting magnet program based on the North Carolina Standard Course of Study.  Students at Underwood in all grades spend their days engaging in meaningful integrated learning activities including dance, drama, music, French, Spanish, Technology, and so much more. Through regular exploration in all these activities, our students can begin to identify the ways in which they are gifted and talented. Because students can choose up to eight different electives a year, they have many opportunities throughout their elementary school experience to shine!

In addition to our strong magnet program, we pride ourselves on providing effective delivery of the assessed curriculum. Students receive assessment driven direct instruction daily through researched best practices.  We also rely on many parent and community volunteers to support student learning. This year we are proud to offer after school learning opportunities for our students as well, including Girls on the Run and Odyssey of the Mind. Students at Underwood are continuously engaged in a learning program that is stimulating and challenging. We encourage you to come and see for your self why our school is special.

It is a child-focused program with the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.

 

The Head Start program is administered by the Office of Head Start, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Grants are awarded by the ACF Regional Offices and the Head Start Bureau's American Indian and Migrant Program Branches directly to local public agencies, private organizations, Indian Tribes and school systems for the purpose of operating Head Start programs at the community level.

The Head Start program has a long tradition of delivering comprehensive and high-quality services designed to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start grantee and delegate agencies provide a range of individualized services in the areas of education and early childhood development: medical, dental, and mental health; nutrition; and parent involvement. In addition, the entire range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each child's and family's developmental, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage and experience.

All Head Start programs must adhere to Program Performance Standards. The Head Start Program Performance Standards define the services that Head Start programs are to provide to the children and families they serve. They constitute the expectations and requirements that Head Start grantees must meet. They are designed to ensure that the Head Start goals and objectives are implemented successfully, that the Head Start philosophy continues to thrive, and that all grantee and delegate agencies maintain the highest possible quality in the provision of Head Start services.

The founding pastors of this entity are Bishop Donald E. Hall, Thomasville N.C., Elder James A. Leak, Reidsville N.C., and Elder Samuel L. Clemmons, Winston-Salem N.C.
 
ONE GOD ASSEMBLIES OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, INC. held our first Unity Meeting on February 21th 2010 at True Deliverance Apostolic Church in Thomasville N.C. The speaker was Elder James A. Leak and his message was titled NON-NEGOTIABLE. We are a continuation of the church which began at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, A D 33, and is founded upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ, himself being the chief cornerstone. While we are yet living in the last days of this dispensation, we as an organization are determined to spread the apostles' doctrine that both the saved and the lost may find hope in these trying times.
 
We stand firm upon the Word of God and encourage all who need a Saviour to obey the words which were spoken by the apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost, ""Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost"" (Acts 2: 38).

Each time the center has been assessed by the North Carolina Division of Child Development and Early Education, it has received a 4-star rating, one of the highest ratings available from the Commission. Ratings are based upon two areas of assessment: (1) Program Standards, and (2) Staff Education. An additional quality point is awarded on the basis of enhanced standards in programming and staff education. The entire staff is certified in First Aid, CPR, SIDS, and Conscious Discipline. In order to receive a 5-star rating, the highest available, WCDC would need to reduce its staff/child ratio.

Designed to maximize natural light, FEELC’s “interactive building” uses found objects and donated materials that change in response to children’s interests. The grounds hold many gardens, including an edible garden harvested for meals at the school, natural areas for exploration, a playground and outdoor stage. Found objects made into art by children hang from ceilings, walls and are scattered indoors and out. Even the roof is put to use. Solar panels installed by a local power company generates and sends power back to the grid. The solar array generates enough to serve 120 NC households each year. — invite discussions and learning.

FEELC’s sustainable operations policy creatively and cooperatively maximizes funds, staff and community resources.  Sustainability permeates both programming and operations. Creatively reusing discarded and donated materials teaches conservation while fostering creativity. Gardening introduces earth friendly practices like mulching, capturing irrigation water and planting to attract bees and butterflies. Catching and releasing small insects for study inspires scientific exploration and demonstrates the need to preserve natural habitats.

FEELC recruits and retains professional teachers who are dedicated to the hearts and development of young children. Staff collaboration, cross-training and the opportunity to use individual creativity make for very low turnover rates among staff.

The charter was written and The Halifax Academy, A Christian School, Inc. was born.

A fifteen-acre tract of land, gifted by Mr. William Shearin, operated grades one through ten in mobile units the first year.

Halifax Academy has experienced remarkable growth since its birth in 1969.  During the 1970-71 school year, a building was erected to supplement the mobile units.  A gymnasium with a seating capacity of 900 was also added.

In the spring of 1986 an elementary building was added which included eight new classrooms, a teacher’s lounge, and guidance office.

In the summer of 1989, with funds raised by the Athletic Council, a weight room, and a coach’s office were added to the gymnasium.

The present 31 acre campus includes a high school building, middle school wing, a elementary building, a library, a guidance office, a cafeteria, gymnasium, and several mobile units.  Since 2000 Halifax Academy has seen considerable growth.  Doublewide trailers were purchased in 2000 and 2001.  During the summer of 2002, four classrooms were built for the fifth and sixth grades.  Two years later classrooms were added for Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten.  The cafeteria was renovated the summer of 2005.  The summer of 2006 four more classrooms were added.

Halifax Academy has operated with the aid and support of the parents and loyal friends in the Roanoke Valley area.";"http://www.halifaxacademy.org/";;;;"http://www.halifaxacademy.org/admissions/admissions-process.html";"http://www.halifaxacademy.org/academics/document-downloads/category/12-school-handbook.html";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"http://www.halifaxacademy.org/images/halifax-academy-vikings.png";;;;;;

With two campus locations in Southern Pines of Moore County and Rockingham of Richmond County, and an Outreach Program that serves Moore, Richmond, Hoke and Scotland Counties, the Center currently serves  over 300 children on a daily basis. Over three-quarters of the children enrolled for developmental disability services come from poverty-level homes. Because of the low economic level of most Center families, Sandhills Children’s Center has always maintained its commitment to build financial support for services through contracts with state and area operated programs and the development of local public and private resources.

We teach students that the principle thing in all of life is wisdom, learning how to apply spiritual truth to the issues and questions of life.  A Biblical viewpoint in all areas of life is strongly stressed to each student during his years of training at RCS.  RCS exists to train Christian young people in the highest principles of Christian leadership, academic studies, self-discipline, individual responsibility, personal integrity, and good citizenship.  In addition to our focus on spiritual development and academic excellence, students have opportunity to develop in the areas of fine arts, athletic competition, and community and church involvement.  Thus, our primary purpose is to train Christian young people to live for Christ in all areas of life—to fulfill God’s purpose for their lives.

Weekly Biblical themes
Daily Bible story 
Weekly chapel services
Daily prayer with the children in each class
Daily singing of Bible songs in each class
The 4 year olds use the “Essentials” Pre-K curriculum, which is also Bible-based and is more in line with the school systems’ needs for school readiness.

The Good Shepherd Day School has been providing services to our community for some fifty years. 

The philosophy behind our curriculum is that young children learn best by being INTERACTIVE.  ""Learning"" requires active thinking and experimenting which stimulates a child to find out how things work and to better understand more about the world in which we live. 

We utilize the Creative Curriculum, a nationally recognized program from which we plan activities, organize the environment of the class room, select toys and materials, plan the daily schedule, and converse with the children.  This curriculum is designed to give your child a successful start in school.

Telamon operates three types of Head Start programs for disadvantaged families: Head Start (preschool for children ages 3 to 5 years old), Early Head Start (childcare for children 0 to 3 years old and pregnant women), and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (childcare and preschool for children of eligible farmworkers ages 0 to 5 years old). Children with disabilities are encouraged to participate in all programs. Telamon’s approach to Head Start services includes:

    A nurturing environment that supports the healthy growth and development of each child in the context of the child's family, culture, and community
    Parents as partners in the shared decision-making process and as active participants in policy groups; and
    Recognition of the importance of strengthening linkages within communities.

Our Head Start programs offer a variety of service models, depending on the needs of families in each community.  Head Start centers provide a secure setting where children can develop their skills under the watchful eyes of well-trained caregivers.  Partial or full-day services at centers include health and dental screenings, nutritious meals, individual as well as group learning experiences, play opportunities and other structured activities. All services and materials are designed to be age and developmentally appropriate as well as sensitive to the cultural and language environment of a child's home. Parents are included in program planning and oversight activities.

Some programs are based in the children’s own home, where staff visit once a week to provide services to the child and family. Children and families who receive these services gather periodically with other enrolled families for a group learning experience facilitated by Telamon staff.";"http://www.telamon.org/north-carolina-head-start.aspx";;;"http://www.telamon.org/employment-training.aspx";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.telamon.org/images/top/telamon-logo.png";;;;;;

This school served students from first grade up to seventh until 1924.  Two sections of this former school are located one block west of our current building.  At this time, those who attended Granite had to find another school for their high school education; which included Faith, Rockwell, or Salisbury.  September 9, 1925 was a joyous occasion as the grammar school became a high school serving grades one through eleven; a senior class wasn’t added until 1945.  Residents were proud of this new two story brick building which was the first accredited high school in Rowan County. 

The PTA spent many hours and resources to improve the school, and their first project was to build a library.  They started with very few books, with the State’s supplement, aids, and hard work they were able to fit the elementary with thirty eight hundred books and three thousand for the high school.  They continued to work hard to provide a safe learning environment for their children and were able to help the school acquire many supplies and equipment to flourish.

It continued to grow and in 1959 East Rowan High School opened and Granite Quarry began serving grades one through eight.  Not far behind, Erwin Junior High opened in 1967 and Granite served grades one through six.  Currently, Granite Quarry Elementary serves Pre Kindergarten through fifth grade.  In 1945 the high school picked the dragon as their mascot and we continue to be proud Granite Quarry Dragons!";"http://www.rss.k12.nc.us/index.php/Schools/School_GQES_teacher/345";;"7:25 am-2:30 pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://www.rss.k12.nc.us/rssys/Graphics/schooltops/GQEStop1.jpg";;;;;;

We recognize the important job we have in assuming responsibility for the care and training of your children and will do our best in serving the needs of our students, and their parents. We truly consider it a privilege whenever someone chooses us to be a part of their children’s lives. Grace Christian Child Development Center and Preschool is a nonprofit childcare center. We offer a curriculum which is based upon the Bible. The center is open to all children, regardless of race, nationality or creed, who may benefit from our type of program. The Center’s program includes child care for infants through four years of age. The center operates Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Proverbs 22:6 states, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” Because of this, our goal is to provide the very best care and training available in a Christian environment. We teach daily of God’s unconditional love and strive to be Godly examples to all of our children and parents. We believe that children must have assistance in five areas of growth: emotional, social, physical, academic and spiritual. Our desire is to help in this development. We understand that family is most important. Because of this, we work hard to assist parents in nurturing and training their children while they are in our care. As a part of our program, we expect to discuss the children’s growth and development with the parents. Continued communication between home and child care center is vital for the development of a close relationship.";"http://cdc.gracechapelsanford.com/about-us/contact-us/";;"Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ";;;"http://cdc.gracechapelsanford.com/parent-handbook/";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

Learning is sequential and children must demonstrate readiness for new understanding based on their maturation and past experiences. Children make sense of the real world through interaction with materials and real people.

Learning should be the outcome of hands-on experiences, especially play. The social interaction made possible through play is the most powerful tool available to children. A richly prepared environment in which children are given opportunities to discover, solve problems, hear stories/rhymes/poems, build, sing, manipulate, explore and construct, stimulates the child's natural curiosity to learn.

Children grow and develop at their own pace. Growth is sequential; one learning experience builds upon the next. Teachers address the needs of the individual child by providing activities which foster physical, emotional, social and cognitive development. Careful
consideration is given to avoid placing more emphasis on one area than on another; all of the major areas working together, in harmony, support the development of the whole child.

Within the center’s daily schedule, each child has opportunities to create, explore the environment, learn problem solving and personal interaction skills, and learn concepts through first-hand experiences. Children develop a positive self-concept through a balance of self-and teacher-facilitated activities.

Opportunities for solitary play as well as group activities are provided. We respect parents as the primary and the most important provider of care and nurturing, and we believe parents and teachers are partners in children’s care and education.

Telamon operates three types of Head Start programs for disadvantaged families: Head Start (preschool for children ages 3 to 5 years old), Early Head Start (childcare for children 0 to 3 years old and pregnant women), and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (childcare and preschool for children of eligible farmworkers ages 0 to 5 years old). Children with disabilities are encouraged to participate in all programs. Telamon’s approach to Head Start services includes:
        A nurturing environment that supports the healthy growth and development of each child in the context of the child's family, culture, and community
        Parents as partners in the shared decision-making process and as active participants in policy groups; and
        Recognition of the importance of strengthening linkages within communities.

    Our Head Start programs offer a variety of service models, depending on the needs of families in each community.  Head Start centers provide a secure setting where children can develop their skills under the watchful eyes of well-trained caregivers.  Partial or full-day services at centers include health and dental screenings, nutritious meals, individual as well as group learning experiences, play opportunities and other structured activities. All services and materials are designed to be age and developmentally appropriate as well as sensitive to the cultural and language environment of a child's home.

We respect and view each child as a unique personality and the most important person in our environment.

Our goal at a child’s place Montessori School is to assist children to reach their fullest potential as healthy, creative, constructive members of a community and to joyfully cultivate a genuine desire for life-long learning.  Part of that assistance is to work closely with the parents, to respect the individual child and his or her needs, and to nurture the qualities of independence, warmth, imagination, honesty, grace and resilience.

a child's place believes that social, racial, religious and cultural diversity in the student body contributes greatly to the value of the school experience. It therefore does not discriminate in admission or placement on the basis of sex, race, religion, disability, creed or national origin.

Although it was a humbling beginning, CCDC began to grow quickly and soon became a leading four star licensed child development center. In May of 2006, CCDC Main welcomed the addition of CCDC City on Faith Road to reach out and service the central region of Rowan County. Once again, this new center proved to be a success and CCDC City became a recognized 4 star licensed child development center. Quickly after the success of CCDC City and with the continued success of CCDC Main, CCDC East on Eastville Drive in Rockwell opened its doors in September of 2006 to service to the eastern region of Rowan County with the same quality. Rising up to the challenge of its predecessors, CCDC East soon became the largest growing 4 star licensed child development center in their area. With the extreme growth and demand in the county, CCDC North located in Spencer emerged on the scene in March of 2009 to reestablish quality child care in that area. With determination, CCDC North proved to be just that when they received their 4 star licensing. Although there are no current plans, CCDC welcomes the opportunity to offer our services to our western Rowan County community.

Currently, Cornerstone Child Development Centers serve over 250 families in Rowan County offering high quality child care. In addition, CCDC employs over 45 full time staff members and is larger than most small businesses.

From our humble beginnings on Webb Rd to the extreme growth with the addition of three top performing facilities, CCDC stands firm on its commitment to be the leading child care provider in Rowan County.";"http://cornerstonecdc.com/";;"6am-6pm";;"http://cornerstonecdc.com/enrollment.php";"http://cornerstonecdc.com/userfiles/Parent%20Handbook%202012%20NCPK%20%2811-8-12%29.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://cornerstonecdc.com/images/header1.gif";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t1.0-9/10302460_663471467041410_2571623944691451443_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/q71/s720x720/10438343_662116837176873_4100455159743366869_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t1.0-9/q72/s720x720/10410510_659957034059520_1465879577782532337_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/q71/s720x720/10306457_659081434147080_7308628414807206344_n.jpg";;

In order to help achieve the academic success necessary to function in a free and independent society, we will implement the skills outlined in the North Carolina Standard Course of Study through the use of the Basic Education Plan established by the State of North Carolina.
To provide a safe and orderly environment, which is conducive to learning, we believe that students must be made aware of expectations and held responsible for socially acceptable behavior and cooperative attitude toward all facets of school life.
Our number one priority is to attain maximum student growth. To do so, we believe in a four-way commitment on the part of the school, the child, the parents, and the community. To ensure that our school is  effective, we dedicate ourselves to providing the best, most updated programs possible for our students. Our

Founded in 1972 by parents who sought a creative, active learning environment for their young children, SPMS has grown for four decades into a highly respected center for pre-school through sixth grade. Located in the beautiful North Carolina mountains, our school prides itself on the integration of our community and its cultures. SPMS focuses on the Montessori approach to child-centered learning, by creating an environment where children feel secure, supported, and stimulated.

We believe that excellent education is built around supporting the whole child. Starting in our toddler classroom (18 months to 3 years old), children are nurtured in an environment that is designed to meet the physical, emotional, and educational needs of a growing child. Continuing in our primary (3-6 year olds) and elementary (6-12 year olds) programs, our teachers help students learn personal responsibility through peaceful resolution of minor conflicts and encourage a positive outlook regarding self and others. The core values in each classroom are respect for oneself, for others, and for the environment. We strive to share the importance of observation, inspiration, communication, and independence.

The small size of our school allows close involvement among staff, students, and parents, creating a powerful sense of community. Thus, children feel valued for who they are, and parents become an important partner in the educational process.

Our  before- and after-school program allows kindergarten and school-age children to balance learning and fun through a variety of experiences. From homework help to fun physical activities, our Before & After program is designed so that everyone goes home happy.";"http://www.fwmchurch.com/#!fwmlc/c1gry";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";;"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/e8e9bb_a210d360d0693f1d4043cbc0ebd6b2c7.jpg_srz_p_285_215_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";;;;;

Telamon operates three types of Head Start programs for disadvantaged families: Head Start (preschool for children ages 3 to 5 years old), Early Head Start (childcare for children 0 to 3 years old and pregnant women), and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (childcare and preschool for children of eligible farmworkers ages 0 to 5 years old). Children with disabilities are encouraged to participate in all programs. Telamon’s approach to Head Start services includes:

    A nurturing environment that supports the healthy growth and development of each child in the context of the child's family, culture, and community
    Parents as partners in the shared decision-making process and as active participants in policy groups; and
    Recognition of the importance of strengthening linkages within communities.

Our Head Start programs offer a variety of service models, depending on the needs of families in each community.  Head Start centers provide a secure setting where children can develop their skills under the watchful eyes of well-trained caregivers.  Partial or full-day services at centers include health and dental screenings, nutritious meals, individual as well as group learning experiences, play opportunities and other structured activities. All services and materials are designed to be age and developmentally appropriate as well as sensitive to the cultural and language environment of a child's home. Parents are included in program planning and oversight activities.

Some programs are based in the children’s own home, where staff visit once a week to provide services to the child and family. Children and families who receive these services gather periodically with other enrolled families for a group learning experience facilitated by Telamon staff.";"http://www.telamon.org/north-carolina-head-start.aspx";;;"http://www.telamon.org/employment-training.aspx";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.telamon.org/images/top/telamon-logo.png";;;;;;

Here a child can develop creative self-expression and the capacity for esteem for self and for others.

     At ADVENTURE WORLD, children take part in a relaxed and unhurried program which promotes learning in math, written and oral language, and the arts and sciences. Here they are encouraged not to become ""super kids"" but to become their own unique selves, caring and compassionate toward themselves and others, self-disciplined and self-directed, curious and inquisitive, respecting others and appreciative of cultural diversity. With positive guidance, children develop independence appropriate to their readiness and acquire the ability to handle conflicts in healthy and constructive ways. Through exposure to developmentally appropriate materials presented in a secure and trustworthy environment, the child is able to think, reason, question, and experiment with self-confidence.";"http://www.adventureworlddaycare.com/";;"6 a.m. to 6 p.m.";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.adventureworlddaycare.com/index_files/logo_small.gif";"http://www.adventureworlddaycare.com/index_files/advworld.jpg";"http://www.adventureworlddaycare.com/index_files/advworld2.jpg";;;;

Our goal is to prepare each child for a rewarding future. Our staff is committed to guiding your child's preschool learning experience with love and understanding, and with the knowledge that we can be a positive influence in his future.

We believe that a sound educational program must consist of daily activities for all children which enhance mental abilities. Promote creativity, address health and nutrition, encourage refinement of motor skills, and teach social development.

We believe that our teachers should be well trained, experienced, and sensitive providers who understand the importance of putting the child first. To achieve this, we ensure that training and education is a continuing goal of each teacher.

By providing a carefully-planned curriculum which addresses the uniqueness of each child, taught by loving and caring teachers, we participate in the education of that child. We understand however that we are only one link in the education chain. We work together with other facilitators and especially with the parents/guardians of our children encouraging them to freely participate in our program. The Center does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, nationality or ethnic origin.";"http://www.childcarewilmingtonnc.com/contact.php";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/All-My-Children-Childcare/114704868616208";"Monday thru Sunday 24 hours a day";"http://www.childcarewilmingtonnc.com/about.php";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";;"http://www.childcarewilmingtonnc.com/images/contactheaderimage.jpg";"http://www.childcarewilmingtonnc.com/images/aboutheaderimage.png";"http://www.childcarewilmingtonnc.com/images/gallery/Slice-12.jpg";"http://www.childcarewilmingtonnc.com/images/gallery/Slice-16.jpg";;

From this vision, Masonboro Baptist's ""Mother's Morning Out"" was established.  We were open two days a week, with a total of 12 children and 2 teachers.  From this small group of children, we expanded step by step until we were a full preschool open 5 days a week from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m..    

In 1989, several of our parents expressed interest in needing full-time Christian care for their children. So in August of 1990, we opened our doors from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years. As we continued to grow, an After School Program was added in 1997 to serve the local community’s elementary school children.  We now are called Noah's Ark Children's Center. 

We have an average of about 125 children each year.  In the Spring of 1997, we were one of only four centers in New Hanover County to be selected by the Child Advocacy Commission to participate in a new Quality Enhancement Program for our area.  As a result of this joint partnership, Noah’s Ark received an AA license.  In June, 2006, Noah’s Ark completed the process for the N. C. Star-Rated License and received 5 Stars out of a possible 5 Stars, which means we will continue to be recognized for the superior center we have always had.  With God’s help, we feel that our dream of touching the lives of children in a Christian environment has become a reality.   ";"http://www.masonborobaptist.org/noah_s_ark_children_s_center";;"7am-6pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";;;;;;;

    Trained, qualified teachers and staff help provide a firm learning foundation, but no one is more important to a child then their own family. We have an open door policy and frequent visits are encouraged so families can see all of the fun and fantastic things that are happening. Great communication between families and teachers is key to a child's overall success. We want families to feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, confide in us, and just plain talk to us-because in the end we are all just human!

Teachers include a daily Bible lesson so that the child’s personal relationship grows and is enhanced with songs, Bible stories and verses.

It began in the home of Nancy Mason. After her son Vernon graduated from college, together they moved her in-home preschool to its’ first location. When they outgrew that location, they opened their second location. After outgrowing two locations and with a little help from Hurricane Floyd, they designed and constructed a state-of-the-art facility in Wilson. Their new facility was built entirely with children’s needs and priorities in mind.

After many years of providing quality childcare in Wilson an opportunity arose in 2007 that took WEE SCHOOL into the Smithfield/Selma and Cleveland areas of Johnston county. Then in 2008 another venture brought WEE SCHOOL into the Glendale-Kenly area of Johnston County. WEE SCHOOL now proudly serves children with 4 locations in Wilson and Johnston Counties.

We believe that although man was created in the image of God, he is a sinner by nature and by choice, resulting in broken fellowship with God and man, sickness, suffering, physical death, and spiritual death. We, therefore, believe a person’s greatest need is to be forgiven of sin and reconciled to God

We, also, believe that by nature, God is not only holy and just, but also loving, compassionate, and merciful. His sovereign will is to reconcile fallen humanity to himself. This divine mission of redemption, which results in spiritual health and wholeness, was made possible by the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, God’s son, and is made real to individuals through the grace of God and personal repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ.

We further believe that upon Christ’s ascension back to heaven, He gave to His church the mission of redemption. Therefore, as the body of Christ, we believe the church must glorify God by making disciples of all people through acts of worship, evangelism, discipleship, ministry, and fellowship.

          When Woodleaf first opened its doors in 1927, it was the Woodleaf Public School and accommodated grades one through twelve.  The first floor of the main building was the elementary school and the upstairs floor had classrooms for the high school.  In addition there were two rooms on the ground floor and an auditorium.  Later a gymnasium and agriculture building completed the school until the 1950’s when a new cafeteria and additional classrooms were added.
         In later years, the high school and junior high students were sent to newly built schools and Woodleaf became an elementary school.

It is a child-focused program with the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.

The Head Start program is administered by the Office of Head Start, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Grants are awarded by the ACF Regional Offices and the Head Start Bureau's American Indian and Migrant Program Branches directly to local public agencies, private organizations, Indian Tribes and school systems for the purpose of operating Head Start programs at the community level.

The Head Start program has a long tradition of delivering comprehensive and high-quality services designed to foster healthy development in low-income children. Head Start grantee and delegate agencies provide a range of individualized services in the areas of education and early childhood development: medical, dental, and mental health; nutrition; and parent involvement. In addition, the entire range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each child's and family's developmental, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage and experience.

All Head Start programs must adhere to Program Performance Standards. The Head Start Program Performance Standards define the services that Head Start programs are to provide to the children and families they serve. They constitute the expectations and requirements that Head Start grantees must meet. They are designed to ensure that the Head Start goals and objectives are implemented successfully, that the Head Start philosophy continues to thrive, and that all grantee and delegate agencies maintain the highest possible quality in the provision of Head Start services.

Telamon operates three types of Head Start programs for disadvantaged families: Head Start (preschool for children ages 3 to 5 years old), Early Head Start (childcare for children 0 to 3 years old and pregnant women), and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (childcare and preschool for children of eligible farmworkers ages 0 to 5 years old). Children with disabilities are encouraged to participate in all programs. Telamon’s approach to Head Start services includes:

    A nurturing environment that supports the healthy growth and development of each child in the context of the child's family, culture, and community
    Parents as partners in the shared decision-making process and as active participants in policy groups; and
    Recognition of the importance of strengthening linkages within communities.

Our Head Start programs offer a variety of service models, depending on the needs of families in each community.  Head Start centers provide a secure setting where children can develop their skills under the watchful eyes of well-trained caregivers.  Partial or full-day services at centers include health and dental screenings, nutritious meals, individual as well as group learning experiences, play opportunities and other structured activities. All services and materials are designed to be age and developmentally appropriate as well as sensitive to the cultural and language environment of a child's home. Parents are included in program planning and oversight activities.

Some programs are based in the children’s own home, where staff visit once a week to provide services to the child and family. Children and families who receive these services gather periodically with other enrolled families for a group learning experience facilitated by Telamon staff.";"http://www.telamon.org/north-carolina-head-start.aspx";;;"http://www.telamon.org/employment-training.aspx";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.telamon.org/images/top/telamon-logo.png";;;;;;
