We monitor our staff in order to maintain the highest standards for security, safety and health as well as curriculum education and staff performance.  In addition, our directors are responsible for conducting evaluations monthly.  Routine procedures must be executed by Teachers and Directors to ensure all quality standards are met. They include a daily school check list and elaborate monthly and quarterly evaluations. There are management and staff evaluations, daily communications between the school, the director, and parents.  These evaluations are further critiqued by the executive director.

To further warranty the soundness and inclusiveness of our school, Parent Surveys are utilized in conjunction with Parent-Teacher meetings.  These surveys and meetings are studied to be sure of the effectiveness of our school and, in addition, offer parent feedback.

Definitive rules and regulations govern our school:
    We strive at all times to keep the health and contentment of our children first and foremost.
    Our schools are cleaned and maintained under the strictest of procedures.
    There are routine assessments for compliance of curriculum, procedures and the general happiness and well being of each child.
    We have consistent evaluations for maintenance and cleanliness of our schools.
    Directors and staff are obligated to fulfill their duties to the highest degree.
    We sponsor continuing education courses for our staff.

Founded in 1906 as a settlement house to help immigrants adjust to life in the U.S., Christopher House has continually evolved to meet the needs of Chicago’s low-income population over the last century. In the 1950’s, we became one of the first Head Start providers in the country. In the 1980s, in active response to a dramatic surge in teen pregnancies, we launched a teen parent program that is among the most effective in the state. In 2009, with several partners, we launched the Chicago Benchmarking Collaborative in an effort to promote better service for families across Chicago through the use of data-driven decision-making. Today, Christopher House is a network of six sites serving nearly 4,000 low income individuals throughout Chicago’s North and West Sides. In August 2013, we opened our new center and our first elementary school in the drastically underserved Belmont Cragin neighborhood.

Each child is valued as a unique individual. Montessori education recognizes that children learn in different ways, and accommodates all learning styles. Students are also free to learn at their own pace, each advancing through the curriculum as he is ready, guided by the teacher and an individualized learning plan.

Beginning at an early age, Montessori students develop order, coordination, concentration, and independence. Classroom design, materials, and daily routines support the individual’s emerging “self-regulation” (ability to educate one’s self, and to think about what one is learning), toddlers through adolescents.

Students are part of a close, caring community. The multi-age classroom—typically spanning 3 years—re-creates a family structure. Older students enjoy stature as mentors and role models; younger children feel supported and gain confidence about the challenges ahead. Teachers model respect, loving kindness, and a belief in peaceful conflict resolution.

Montessori students enjoy freedom within limits. Working within parameters set by their teachers, students are active participants in deciding what their focus of learning will be. Montessorians understand that internal satisfaction drives the child’s curiosity and interest and results in joyous learning that is sustainable over a lifetime.

Students are supported in becoming active seekers of knowledge. Teachers provide environments where students have the freedom and the tools to pursue answers to their own questions.

Self-correction and self-assessment are an integral part of the Montessori classroom approach.As they mature, students learn to look critically at their work, and become adept at recognizing, correcting, and learning from their errors.

Given the freedom and support to question, to probe deeply, and to make connections, Montessori students become confident, enthusiastic, self-directed learners. They are able to think critically, work collaboratively, and act boldly—a skill set for the 21st century.

The form of service that a Montessori school takes has a practical value, when it is performed with an attitude of love. It recognizes the importance of the task, when it comes to dealing with the child’s nature in the prime of their development. Their carefree hearts and restless pranks reflect qualities which are inherently divine and blissfully innocent. Our mission is to see how far we can recognize and make use of the child’s potential, while nurturing these essential aspects of their nature. The teachers thus have a unique opportunity through their roles. A little patience, a little kindness, infinite understanding and sweet love, are the means by which they can express this gratitude.

Reading is the key to independent learning and therefore we have developed a program that guides your child through steps enabling him or her to become an early reader. 

Children who learn to read before elementary school are better learners reading at their own individual pace and at First School we provide your child with that opportunity. Our classes are structured to allow the individual child to progress at his/her own rate and level and each of our classes includes an early education curriculum that develops social skills side by side with his/her academic knowledge.

The concepts and experiences in our program are sequential and developmental. Our curriculum has a Montessori basis which utilizes hands-on activities and equipment. The language program we use is phonetic as well as visual because some children learn best aurally while others do visually. 

We have incorporated a computer program and a four station light tracing table to reinforce the hands-on activities. Your child will learn language, math, science, art, music, and fine and gross motor skills while developing important social and self-help skills.

In addition to eight classrooms, the building has a multi-purpose room, a kitchen, offices, a conference room and a library. The center has a playground designed for infants and toddlers as well as a playground for children 3 to 5-years-old.

The program offers full-day, school-day and part-day classes for children 3 to 5 years of age. For children under 3-years-old, full-day and 3 1/2 hour sessions are available. Transportation is provided for the preschoolers enrolled in school-day and part-day classes. All meals are prepared at the center.

Head Start collaborates with the Spectrum Early Childhood program to provide dual enrollment for children with a diagnosed disability. For children with a disability who are not dually enrolled with Spectrum, Champaign County Head Start/Early Head Start (CCHS) contracts with individual therapist to provide on-site therapy. CCHS coordinates with Child and Family Connections to bring therapy services on-site to any children younger than 3-years-old who have a delay or disability.

Immanuel provides a Christian atmosphere for children as young as two, and utilizes songs, prayers, and daily activities centering around the love of Jesus.

    1971 A committee was formed to establish the 4C's (Community Coordinated Child Care) now known as the Child Care Network of Evanston.
    1972 The 4C's collaborated with School District 65 to offer after-school child care.  After-school care was offered in five elementary schools.
    1973-1974 A second Head Start, operated by Evanston CEDA Neighbors at Work, merged with District 65's Head Start program, providing services for an additional 30 children.
    1974 District 65 initiated an after-kindergarten care program for A.M. students.  Enrolled students were bused to two schools.
    1976 The Early Childhood Center opened at Miller School.  This program was the dream of Superintendent Joseph E. Hill.  The school hosted five programs: Head Start, after-kindergarten/child care program, Community Child Care, Services for Pre-Primary Age Children (SPPAC), and Family Focus.
    1979 The Early Childhood Center moved to Kingsley Elementary School with the exception of the after-kindergarten program.  The early childhood program remained at Kingsley until 1990.
    1982 Then Superintendent, Dr. Robert Campbell, expanded the after-school program to include before school programming and made it available at all 12 schools.  The program was one of the first to operate within a public school system in Illinois.

Each Montessori classroom, from birth through kindergarten operates on the same principal of freedom within limits. Children can work alone or with others integrating individual choice and group activities. Through daily observation the teacher decides what activities and materials to introduce into the classroom. The goal is to encourage active, self-directed learning, and strike a balance of individual mastery. We believe in making learning fun and not a forced activity.

Our mission is to provide a safe, loving environment designed to engage your child and support their cognitive, physical, and social emotional growth. Our philosophy follows developmentally appropriate practices as prescribed by NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children).   Research confirms that planned activities that provide hands-on learning, collaborative play and exploration provide meaningful learning experiences for young children. Our curriculum is planned by teachers degreed in Early Childhood Education.  Topics of study are implemented through project work which meet Illinois Early Learning Standards and Objectives.  Through guided exploration, children discover different ways to obtain answers to their questions.  We build a strong foundation for young children to become life-long learners. Our teachers act as facilitators, preparing the environment, modeling appropriate behavior, and helping young children learn self-control.  Our teachers praise good behavior,  acknowledge feelings, redirect and set clear limits when necessary.  Children learn how to problem solve, negotiate and share with others.   We teach children to respect themselves, others, and their surroundings. Our teachers recognize parents as their child's first teachers.  We establish strong partnerships with parents, through parent notes, newsletters, conferences, curriculum nights, and family events.  Through a combination of low child-staff ratios and close teacher interaction, optimum growth and development can take place.  Parents are welcome to stop in at any time throughout the day.

Day Care activities are designed to promote the well being of children by fostering the development of a wide variety of skills, as well as social competence and a positive self-image. Children gain experience in areas such as arts and crafts, group games, sports activities such as swimming and ice skating, movement and music, camps, and field trips.

Each year, our Day Care program serves more than 600 school-aged children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Our day care fees are assessed on a sliding scale and offset by financial aid when necessary to ensure that every family in our community has access to high-quality day care - regardless of income - and that children from low-income families have the same growth opportunities as their peers.

Through skillful observation of each child, Academy teachers extend a child's development by providing experiences that help them make connections with what they already know and can achieve.

Teachers plan meaningful integrated activities to meet four categories of curriculum goals for each child:
• Skills - Developing large and small muscles, manners, habits, and other practices related to positive relationships and living.
• Knowledge - Developing foundations of math, science, social studies, problem solving abilities, language arts, music, and art.
• Feelings - Developing feelings of trust, adequacy, competence, acceptance and self-esteem.
• Dispositions - Developing tendencies related to literacy (focused participation, risk taking, hypothesis testing, persistence, and self-regulation) and toward creative thinking, curiosity, and learning.

The Village Children's Academy works to develop strong lines of communication between the school and parents. Formal conferences are scheduled throughout the year and the staff is available for informal meetings on an ongoing basis.  In addition, a parent board works closely with the school's management to ensure an even greater ongoing flow of communications and the development of new ideas. 

Curriculum is designed to promote learning, experience, and development in the following areas:
• Whole Language
• Phonics
• Art
• Music
• Math
• Science
• Nutrition and Health
• Social Relationships
• Spanish

Other activities include:

Less formally, Baker is a school where children learn by doing.

Founded in 1918 by Clara Belle Baker, a leader in progressive education, the curriculum today still reflects the philosophy she shared with the likes of Francis Parker, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget. In broad strokes, the school emphasizes hands-on learning over lectures and memorization of facts. Furthermore, as the North Shore’s only demonstration school, Baker is a place where students from leading college- and graduate-level education programs come to learn from our master instructors as teachers-in-training. Consequently, the majority of the classrooms have both a teacher and an associate teacher. It is the unique combination of demonstration school and progressive curriculum which makes Baker uniquely suited to teach children to love to learn, cherish the journey and serve the world.";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Baker-Demonstration-School/92910953966";"Mon - Fri: 7:30 am - 6:00 pm";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/employment.html";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/admissions.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/images/masthead.jpg";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/images/banners/aboutus_landing_welcome.jpg";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/images/banners/admissions_landing_learners.jpg";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/images/banners/home_directory.jpg";"http://www.bakerdemschool.org/images/banners/admissions_faq.jpg";;

Judy Monaco began the center as a licensed home child care in 1993. Prior to this, she was the owner and director of The Little Gingerbread House in Oak Lawn. Opening another center was always a goal for Judy. In 2005, Judy's daughter Beth Orr, graduated with her BA in Early Childhood Education. It was at this point, that this mother and daughter team began actively looking for a location to open a child care center. In July of 2008, Ready, Set Grow opened its doors. It began with the enrollment of the 12 children from Judy's home child care, and quickly grew to over 70 part time and full time children enrolled in just 2 years!

In so doing, we focus on activities in the areas of language, social, and motor development. Our program includes: Arts and Crafts, Music, Literature, Writing, Dramatic Play and Science activities. We encourage the art of doing, as it is through experience and practice that a child progresses.

In general, we provide an informal and natural home type setting which is important in making children feel welcome and accepted by his/her teachers and peers. This also makes him/her feel secure and protected.

Finally, our overall goal is to foster a positive attitude to each and every child, giving all the encouragement and support needed to grow and carry on day to day.

Founded in 1987 by Robert and Sharon Breen, the school has grown in response to community interest in Montessori education. We offer programs for children ages 15 months through 14 years. Commitment is the most important part of our relationship with our students and their families. By focusing on each child as a unique individual, we offer learning experiences that satisfy each child's interests and needs. Workshops and other events for parents are offered throughout the year. Parents may also support or join the Parent Task Force, which works on fundraising, community projects, and school events. Parental support comes naturally as you connect with the educational process, and thus the school becomes an important part of the community.

Our mission is to help your child build the foundation for a happy and capable adolescence and adulthood.
We encourage children to exercise good judgment, cooperate with others, and use self-discipline--to develop values and skills that allow each child to become an important member of the social group. Daily discoveries and new experiences create a thirst for more knowledge, preparing your child for all that life has to offer.";"http://www.dupageschool.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/dupage.montessori";;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.dupageschool.org/images/headerpic-1.jpg";;;;;;

The staff of the Presbyterian Child Development Center Day Care (PCDC) or (Center) is pleased that your child will be attending the Center. We hope the time your child spends with us will hold many worthwhile and enjoyable experiences as children, parents, and teachers all learn together. The Center communicates with families in their primary language or utilizes resources as needed to communicate with families.

Parents are an important part of the children’s experiences at the Center. We look forward to getting to know you better through daily sharing, special parent visits to the Center and parent conferences. All family members are welcome to come and visit children enrolled at our center. We ask that you let the Director or the class room teacher know the day before so you can receive a visitor pass. We hope that both you and your child will find the time spent in the Center exciting and rewarding.

Every Academy operates the way any good neighborhood business does. We know our community and we understand how best to serve the parents and children who live there.

Along the way, we have become widely recognized for our innovation, leadership, and reputation for excellence in early education. As a pioneer in education-based care, La Petite Academy is matched by very few organizations for the perspective and insight we’ve achieved.

In 2007, we became part of the Learning Care Group, one of the largest providers of early childhood care and educational services in the United States. La Petite Academy is an equal opportunity provider.

This level of excellence can only come about when there is a continuing commitment that spans generations and welcomes newcomers.  Our dynamic curriculum is based on fundamentals that have proven to be effective.  Our well-credentialed staff of professional educators make learning personal and fun.
At LCNS, we firmly believe that one of the greatest gifts we can give our children is the passion for curiosity.  The early love of learning develops and serves them throughout their lives.  Our play-based approach capitalizes on the normal curiosity and interests of children.
LCNS is wholly dedicated to providing the encouragement and age-appropriate, child-centered curriculum that provides learning experiences to develop a child’s skills, confidence and overall aptitude.  Learning through active participation brings meaning and interest to a child’s world.
Today, this dedication to innovation and excellence is more important than ever.  As the Illinois elementary education system adopts the new Common Core curriculum standards, our students will need to apply sound learning methods while having confidence in their skills.

This level of excellence can only come about when there is a continuing commitment that spans generations and welcomes newcomers.  Our dynamic curriculum is based on fundamentals that have proven to be effective.  Our well-credentialed staff of professional educators make learning personal and fun.
At LCNS, we firmly believe that one of the greatest gifts we can give our children is the passion for curiosity.  The early love of learning develops and serves them throughout their lives.  Our play-based approach capitalizes on the normal curiosity and interests of children.
LCNS is wholly dedicated to providing the encouragement and age-appropriate, child-centered curriculum that provides learning experiences to develop a child’s skills, confidence and overall aptitude.  Learning through active participation brings meaning and interest to a child’s world.
Today, this dedication to innovation and excellence is more important than ever.  As the Illinois elementary education system adopts the new Common Core curriculum standards, our students will need to apply sound learning methods while having confidence in their skills.

Such a program should provide activities for each child, based on his or her age and developmental level and should be tailored to meet the needs of the child rather than expecting the child to adjust to the demands of a specific program. It is important that knowledge of growth and development be applied to program practices and that staff be responsive to individual differences. Children’s play is important to intellectual, physical, emotional and social growth. Therefore, child-initiated teacher-supported play is an essential part of our program.
We recognize the importance of adults as role models of acceptable behavior. Children begin to pattern their own ways of acting and reacting after that of the adults they are with each day. We believe the program staff should explore values that promote a sense of self-worth and respect for the child’s own rights as well as the rights of others. We feel this can best be done by providing an atmosphere of acceptance, warmth, and understanding in a safe, nurturing environment. We feel that it is important to develop a program which is sensitive to the needs of children and responsive to the concerns of their family.";"http://www.jldhkids.com/contact-jennings-lyon.htm";;"Monday to Friday:

It is our goal to support children in realizing their highest potential by striving to educate and nurture the whole child -- the physical, the social, the emotional, the creative, the intellectual, and the intuitional self.

We feel it is important to nurture kind and loving feelings as the child's emotional sensitivity develops in acts of simple service from tending the plants and animals to keeping the classroom clean and helping each other physically and emotionally - children learn the highest joy is to care for one another in the spirit of kindness and sharing. Our focus is not only on intellectual education, but also the education of the heart.

Unlike traditional education that only directs the child's attention outward, children are taught to know themselves. All activities are designed to expand the child's sense of oneness and sympathy with all life. Through the study and exploration of nature, they learn to appreciate the many lessons and diversity of life.

At MorningStar we utilize an integrated curriculum approach. Each academic lesson is coordinated with a diverse variety of artistic activities. Students are encouraged to think, reason, question and discover as well as appreciate opportunities for creative expression. To more greatly enhance intuitional advancement, simple meditations, and yoga are practiced daily.";"http://morningstarpreschool.net/";;"7:30 a.m.-5:45 p.m. ";;;"http://morningstarpreschool.net/htmlpages/parentshandbook.pdf";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://morningstarpreschool.net/images/Bitmap_in_morningstar.cdrR1C1.JPG";"http://morningstarpreschool.net/images/DCP_3238.JPG";"http://morningstarpreschool.net/images/DCP_3276.JPG";"http://morningstarpreschool.net/images/DCP_3262.JPG";"http://morningstarpreschool.net/images/DCP_3226.JPG";;

Our goal is to provide child care for children ages 6 weeks to 12 years of age, in a safe and educational environment.  We will provide care to all children regardless of race, gender, and economical background.  We strive to be the best Child Care Center in the area.  We take pride in the education aspect of our organization.  

Kids Castleâ€™s hours of operation are 6:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  We provide breakfast, morning snack, lunch and afternoon snack to all of the children on a daily basis.  All meals and snack are in accordance with the Illinois State Board of Education regulations through the state food program.  Our menus are posted in each classroom for the convenience of our parents and staff.  Our cooks have their sanitation license and are expected to keep it current.  They also have training in First Aid and CPR.  

As part of our promise to provide the kind of care and education the parents want for their children, we feel that the parents should be involved every step of the way.  We encourage all parents to visit anytime, call as much as they would like and join us for field trips or special family events at the center.  We are here for the children and our parents.  We work together as a team to ensure your childâ€™s safety and education.

With that said, we feel the first five years of childhood are the most important years in development and learning.  We provide a creative educational curriculum that will help children to reach their fullest potential.  The lessons will be developmentally appropriate and will develop the child physically, intellectually, emotionally as well as socially.  We encourage the children to explore and develop at his or her own pace.  

Kids Castle Learning Center takes certain measures to ensure the safety of the children.  Each morning, upon arrival at the center, we require all parents to sign in their children into the Pro Care computer system.  Each individual will be able to choose two four to eight digit codes that will allow them to clock their children in and out each day.  After signing the children into the computer system, we encourage our parents to take their children to their appropriate teacher/classroom.  At the end of the day, upon departure we ask our parents to sign their children out of the computer system before retrieving them from their classroom.  Each individual who is on the pick-up list is required to provide a photo ID before being able to pick up children.  Along with our computer system we also have all of our doors locked at all times.  Parents as well as guests have to check in at the office before proceeding to the classroom where their children maybe.  At this current time our Maynor location has security cameras in the hallways as well as on the outside of our premises.  We take all of these measures to protect the children in our care as well as our staff.

We emphasize a joyful, playful climate with a culture of intellectual inquiry and critical thinking.

Every Academy operates the way any good neighborhood business does. We know our community and we understand how best to serve the parents and children who live there.

Along the way, we have become widely recognized for our innovation, leadership, and reputation for excellence in early education. As a pioneer in education-based care, La Petite Academy is matched by very few organizations for the perspective and insight we’ve achieved.

In 2007, we became part of the Learning Care Group, one of the largest providers of early childhood care and educational services in the United States. La Petite Academy is an equal opportunity provider.

Learning takes place through child initiated free choice activities, group activities and skill-focused learning (fine motor, gross motor, perceptual, memory, problem solving and literacy). Our preschool program is designed to be informal and flexible, but the curriculum and environment are a result of careful planning by the staff. The curriculum is designed to help each child develop socially, emotionally, physically, intellectually and spiritually. At My Father's World Preschool the children have activities, read stories and sing songs about God and Jesus. Christian love and caring is the basis for our program throughout the year.";"http://www.prince-of-peace.org/MFW_Preschool.html";;;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";"http://www.prince-of-peace.org/images/830c66cb323c6c50c0eff3cef172345f_i5rq.png";"http://www.prince-of-peace.org/images/856428be230dae70cd4387e7bc6b0710_gvy5.png";"http://www.prince-of-peace.org/images/1fad749e295193206db8b133d6f46bab_hagi.png";"http://www.prince-of-peace.org/images/b6b28eab37c181ba13d5566cd3fea65a_wi6t.png";"http://www.prince-of-peace.org/images/d2474a3bb276049bfa6c116534a6274f_j5jg.png";;

Imagine children having so much fun in school that they can’t wait to arrive each morning. The excitement of our preschoolers is the result of a team effort. Our teachers are enthusiastic about developing lifelong learners. They genuinely care about children, and have the sensitivity and knowledge to understand a child’s individual developmental needs and learning styles.

Our learning environment is built around children and their needs. It’s a place where children feel safe and ready to absorb what the world has to offer. Our classrooms feature well-equipped learning centers to allow hands-on practice of new skills in smaller groups.  Outdoor time on our playground is built into every day’s schedule, weather permitting.

Nothing is more important than your child’s safety. We maintain records of those authorized to pick up each child. No child is released without proper authorization. All visitors to our school are greeted, asked to sign the Visitor Log and state the purpose of their visit. Picture identification is required from all unfamiliar visitors.

We know that parents play a critical role in their child's educational success and positive attitude toward learning. So, building and maintaining strong parent-teacher relationships is crucial to everything we do here. For children to get the best possible education, everyone needs to be involved. We’re proud that at our school, effective communication among parents, teachers and staff is a way of life.

After you've had the opportunity to review our website, please feel free to contact us to schedule a private tour.

We aid them in developing a positive self-image, and through our child-focused programming, we foster a joy of learning. The opportunity to learn is introduced through developmentally appropriate activities designed to develop skills in the areas of social, physical, and cognitive growth. This opportunity, available to all children and their families, is presented in a warm and accepting environment that encourages a sense of security and trust.

We believe all children deserve an equal opportunity to learn and develop to their greatest potential. Children learn in a positive, nurturing, stimulating environment where they’re encouraged to solve problems, be independent, satisfy their natural curiosities, make choices, and understand the impact their actions have on others. “Thoughtful play” is productive play that develops self-esteem and cognitive skills. We believe that an eclectic approach to education provides the opportunity for a balance between adult- and child-initiated activities.

Parent involvement is an important part of our well-balanced, family-oriented program. We have an open-door policy in which you are welcome to visit at any time and encouraged to participate in any or all activities. Our goal is to become a partner with your family in our common goal of providing quality education and care for your child.

Kairos School gives youngsters who are two and a half to five years old an opportunity for these meaningful experiences. Our goal is to guide each child in developing their own creative and learning skills, and to foster positive Christian attitudes about themselves and the people around them.

Why a church sponsored school? We believe that as children become aware of their place in the Community of Faith, they become just as conscious of their place in the church family as they are of the family in their home. We stress church doctrine and theology only as we express them through everyday Christian living.

The Kairos School program is planned to create an atmosphere in which each child feels secure in beginning to explore the world outside their home. We encourage each child to grow at their own rate - emotionally, mentally, and scholarly. We believe that each child's self image is underlined by the quality of teaching they receive. This, in turn, determines what they will care and dare to learn.";"http://www.montpres.org/kairos_school.html";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.montpres.org/Images/kairos.jpg";"http://www.montpres.org/Images/Kairos_schoolroom.jpg";"http://www.montpres.org/Images/Kairos_table.jpg";"http://www.montpres.org/Images/Kairos_schoolroom2.jpg";;;

As theorist suggest (Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, and Erikson), children learn through their individual experiences with the world.

When children build upon experiences they “construct” knowledge by building new experiences and connecting them to prior knowledge. Young children are active and curious participants in the construction of their knowledge.

Teachers challenge children to make predictions, to explore, to discover, to challenge, to represent and to reorganize their ways of thinking.

Positive development of self-image is important and is a priority in all aspects of program planning. Teachers provide opportunities for learning in an environment of respect and trust between and among all participants, young and old.

In building upon trusting, respectful relationships, teachers learn the needs of individual children and plan for the successful fulfillment of those needs.

The unique qualities of each child and adult are valued and differences are respected. We create an environment of cooperation and collaboration to enhance the process of learning to work together.

Understanding that the child is a member of his/her family, it is our goal to collaborate with family members in creating the best environment for each child. Building an equal relationship between family, child and teacher is an integral part of our philosophy.

Janice Lowder wanted to create a space where children could learn and discover through play. She purchased the land on the north edge of Virden in the1986.

The center was built that Summer and opened it's doors on October 6, 1986. There were 12 students with 1 teacher and her aid.

A collaboration was formed in 1989 when the Care-O-sel subcontracted the Prekindergarten-At-Risk Program from the local school district. Two teachers and two aides were hired to provide forty-five children with preschool classes. Room for the program at the center was created by moving the school age portion of the program to the Virden elementary school.

All special needs children - three, four and five - moved to the center with their teacher and aid in 1992. This inclusion was supported by the State Board of Education. A teaching team was formed from the child care workers, the prekindergarten staff and the special education teachers.

Accreditation from the National Association for the Education of Young Children was achieved in 1994. The program was one of the 300 in the the State of Illinois to be accredited. This honor attests to the high quality of care and education children and their families receive through the program.

In 2007, we became part of the Learning Care Group, one of the largest providers of early childhood care and educational services in the United States. La Petite Academy is an equal opportunity provider.

We hope you and your child become part of our story, today.";"http://www.lapetite.com/our-schools/belleville-il-7099/";"https://www.facebook.com/LaPetiteAcademy";"06:30 AM - 06:30 PM";"http://www.lapetite.com/about-us/child-care-careers/";"http://www.lapetite.com/child-care-centers/enrollment/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/infants-toddlers.jpg";"http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/twos-early-preschool.jpg";"http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/2013-summer/preschool-boy-coloring.jpg";"http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/2013-summer/pre-k-girl-smiling.jpg";;

To provide a home away from home, a loving family atmosphere to help each child grow physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally.

Established in 1980 the St. Henry Creative Learning Center is a full service Child Care Facility operated in accordance with the provisions of the Child Care Act of Illinois.  The staff is DCFS certified and CPR certified.

The St. Henry Creative Learning Center program is designed to prepare children for Kindergarten by providing them with the necessary skills required for success.  This is accomplished by providing the experiences which develop those skills through such subjects as language, mathematics, art and music, as well as socialization.

We have a well balanced pre school program that is incorporated with the child's care.  We take field trips to many interesting places such as the Zoo, Apple Picking and Pumpkin Picking to name a few.  We host many visitors for entertainment, safety and educational benefits of the whole child.  Among those visitors are, Magicians, Policeman, Dentists and many more.

 Among our many programs available to the children is a Computer Tots Program.  This program introduces the child to the use of the computer.  For a slight up charge, the Lil Tumblers Program identifies the child's need to strengthen and develop their muscles through the use of the “gym on wheels”.  The child is able to climb, exercise and walk on balance beams.

 Special events include a Thanksgiving Dinner prepared with the assistance of the children, a Christmas Program, an Easter Egg Hunt, along with activities to include parents.  Birthday's are celebrated each month with cake, ice cream and all the trimmings.

  In addition to our pre school program we also conduct a Summer Camp for children 6 to 12 years of age.  All of our programs are intended to make the children 's day at the center a pleasant one.";"http://www.sthenryclc.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.sthenryclc.com/templates/sthenryclc-com_clear/images/logo.png";"http://www.sthenryclc.com/media/1/100_0140.JPG";"http://www.sthenryclc.com/media/1/100_0176.JPG";"http://www.sthenryclc.com/media/1/St%20Henry%20CLC%20031.JPG";;;

We strive to:

Learn to listen, follow directions, have responsibilities, be courteous, orderly and willing to share.

Familiarize the children with the alphabet to know letters by sight and sound, using games, names, flannel board activities, etc.

Know primary colors, shapes and numbers.

Strengthen and improve large motor skills and coordination (skipping, hopping, rhythm, balancing, bouncing balls, etc.).

Strengthen and improve small motor skills (cutting, coloring, writing, drawing – both free hand and directed).

Teach a concept of the world around them through plants, animals, walks, the weather, and other aspects of nature.

Encourage good health and eating habits.

All of the goals of our program will be implemented through a planned program of activities, finger plays, songs, games, and the child’s natural curiosity.  Some repetitive activities are planned because the young child loves to repeat the familiar.  The director will be happy to discuss any questions regarding the program at any time.

Memory Lane Preschool is an exciting, fun place for your child to come and experience many things. We provide an environment where each child can have a safe place to build their self esteem through encouraging their creativity, curiosity, and social and emotional capabilities.  We appreciate the fresh outlook these children have as we help them discover their world. 

We provide a variety of activities to foster early learning skills such as free play time with friends, carpet time for discussion and songs, and group times for games, science activities, and engaging stories.  Your child will have an opportunity to gain math and reading readiness skills, learn counting and number recognition, and practice sequencing.  Your child will also learn letters and sounds of the alphabet, shapes and colors.  They will participate in craft and art activities, outdoor play and make new friends.

We offer a Monday-Wednesday- Friday class and a Tuesday-Thursday class. You may choose to have your child enrolled all five days. Our preschool time is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. For more information about our daily activities, please see the ""Schedule"" page of this site.

Our licensed and qualified staff has the patience and experience that has helped us establish our reputation for excellence.

Our programs are designed to maximize your child's learning potential, while fostering their intersocial skills and behaviors. Our curriculum is designed to meet the total needs of the child by coordinating activities and experiences at the child’s pace, allowing space and equipment and movement necessary for overall early childhood development. It is also to provide a balance between quiet and active periods, between academic awareness and comfortable relaxation, always allowing the joy of self-discovery and the pleasure of social interaction.

The original object, according to the State Charter of November 26, 1921, was “to maintain a day nursery to assist women in the care of their children and to use its influence in procuring employment for women.”

     Although a new building replaced the original facility in 1951, the purpose had remained basically the same: “to provide day care for young children between the ages of two years and six years, whose parents are employed or in training.”

     In August of 1989, we added a new wing and expanded our services to care for children through 12 years of age.  Our Before and After School and Summer Day Camp Program is designed to fill the needs of children in Kindergarten through 6th grade. 

     In February of 2005 we relocated to 2323 South 6th Street and were able to further expand our mission to care for children 6 weeks to 12 years of age.  The addition of our infant/toddler program fulfills a dream that has been shared by the founders of this organization and those who followed.

In 1989, the school moved from a Winnebago church basement to the present building on Benton Street, in order to meet state guidelines. The school is run by a governing Board of Directors made up of parents and/or members of the community. The Board of Directors holds meetings once a month. Parents of the school children comprise the voting membership when choosing the Board of Directors. Elections for the positions are held in October. Parents are encouraged to attend and/or get involved.

This fosters a strong sense of community and respect for self, others, and the environment, which builds a strong academic foundation for a lifetime of learning.

A Montessori environment is a community in miniature.  The children are expected to follow the rules established in that community.  This is not always an easy task for a pre-schooler. At this age, children believe that they are the center of the universe and everything revolves around their wishes and whims.  When they enter the Montessori environment, they quickly discover that they have to sublimate their wants and desires to those of the larger group.  In this way, they begin learning the important lessons of self-control, sharing, and good citizenship.";"http://www.parkviewmontessori.com/";;"6:30am - 6:00pm";;"http://www.parkviewmontessori.com/application.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.parkviewmontessori.com/images/logo.jpg";"http://www.parkviewmontessori.com/images/contents-img.jpg";;;;;

We are the 2nd largest provider of Head Start services in Chicago, educating children at over 43 sites, our impact can be felt throughout 18 aldermanic wards in which we prepare over 1000 children for kindergarten each year.

Second, our Family Health effort, although not clinical in focus, targets the health education of the family from ""birth to three"":  HBH impacts the lives of over 3000 families each year.";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/index.php/locations/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://50.28.8.201/~henryboo/themes/henryboothhouse/images/HBH-Logo.gif";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/2913/0076/0319/girl-barette.jpg";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/7213/0065/6807/content-page-top.jpg";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/6313/2760/5750/HBH-Kids.jpg";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/4413/2760/8025/programs-headstart.jpg";;

In order to remain faithful to our mission, Catholic Charities is guided by these core values: Respect, Compassion, Competence and Stewardship.

Our mission and values are based on the firm foundation of Catholic Social Teaching, a collection of themes developed in papal and other writings over the course of the Church’s history. These themes include the belief that human life is sacred; that all humans have inherent dignity, rights and responsibilities; that social structures like marriage and the family must be supported; that the needs of the poor and vulnerable must be met; and that we must be responsible stewards of God’s creation.

Far from limiting our focus, our Catholic identity and values enable us to truly be “universal,” which is what “catholic” really means. The tenets of Catholic Social Teaching call us to serve everyone, regardless of their belief or background, and to employ anyone, not just Catholics, who commits to our mission. Christ reached out to people of all faiths, and Catholic Charities does the same, with the goal of transforming lives for the better.";"http://www.catholiccharities.net/GetHelp/OurServices/ChildDevelopment.aspx";;;"http://www.catholiccharities.net/AboutUs/CareerOpportunities.aspx";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://www.catholiccharities.net/Portals/0/CatholicCharitiesLogo.png";"http://www.catholiccharities.net/portals/0/Programs%20and%20Services/Child%20Development/Images/childhood_developmentBanner.jpg";"http://www.catholiccharities.net/portals/0/Human%20Resources/Images/Hunger%20Walk-HR.jpg";;;;

I am honored to be the program director of this vibrant and dedicated staff at MMCC.  For the past sixteen years I have worked with children from three years old to high school students as a certified Montessori educator, Spanish teacher, Master teacher, Principal, and parent.  It is both rewarding and humbling to observe and guide the child on his/her path as they emerge through each continual stage of development.
  
MMCC is unique; we have a long history of over 27 years of providing an excellent educational environment for our Swedish Covenant Hospital employee’s children of all backgrounds. Our experienced, well qualified staff and our beautiful grounds and classrooms facilitate the development of the whole child; while focusing on their intellectual, physical, social, and global awareness and building up a solid foundation of essential 21st century skills.  We foster self-independence, problem-solving skills, concentration, and joy of learning through the Montessori curriculum.

Our skilled teachers will help your child learn and develop through both group play and adult interaction.

We respect and value the differences in each child as to her or his interests, developmental needs and personality. We appreciate and value different family, cultural, racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Our curriculum is based on the premise that children are naturally curious about their environment and that play is the essential ingredient of our preschool program. Through play in a well arranged and regularly enriched environment, children learn about themselves and their capabilities and develop their cognitive, social and emotional capacities. Teachers create a challenging environment in which information is available through a variety of materials.

In the art area, children may have experiences with color, texture, shape, line and the expressive, creative quality of the materials. Building with blocks introduces the child to spatial, pre-math relationships such as balance and symmetry as well as promoting team effort and using a material to represent an idea. We provide many experiences that foster a love of reading and writing. Through exposure to good literature, ""writing"" activities, songs and finger plays we set the stage for later reading and writing. The dramatic play area offers opportunities to play adult roles and explore the magical world of fantasy and imagination. We have access to indoor gyms and a beautiful outdoor space that provide opportunities for large motor play.

We provide experiences that foster a sense of self as a competent individual, an internalization of self-control, and a positive pattern of interaction with others. While nurturing and supporting each individual child, teachers also strive to encourage a sense of community and a sense of the importance of each child as a participating member of a group.

We work to ensure a childhood experience filled with adventure, play, investigation and friendship. We care very much about the children and families of Loyola University Preschool.";"http://www.luc.edu/preschool/philosophystatement/";;"7:30 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

Founded in 1898 by the Chicago Ethical Humanist Society, HBH primarily focused on the development of ethical principles, education and quality of life.  It is named after Judge Henry Booth, the organization's first President.
 
From then until now, we drive this mission via 2 distinct and complementary core competencies anchoring both of these efforts in the education of the family.

First, in Head Start, our overarching goal is to ""prepare at-risk children, 3-5 years of age for kindergarten and families for self-sufficiency"".  We are the 2nd largest provider of Head Start services in Chicago, educating children at over 43 sites, our impact can be felt throughout 18 aldermanic wards in which we prepare over 1000 children for kindergarten each year.

Second, our Family Health effort, although not clinical in focus, targets the health education of the family from ""birth to three"":  HBH impacts the lives of over 3000 families each year.";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/index.php/locations/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://50.28.8.201/~henryboo/themes/henryboothhouse/images/HBH-Logo.gif";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/2913/0076/0319/girl-barette.jpg";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/7213/0065/6807/content-page-top.jpg";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/6313/2760/5750/HBH-Kids.jpg";"http://www.henryboothhouse.org/files/4413/2760/8025/programs-headstart.jpg";;

development.
We want them to be a successful people in the future, so we teach them a lot. Our European style bilingual teaching is based on Jean Piaget's
Theory of cognitive development and epistemological view which are called ""genetic epistemology"". It means that our children learn by playing.
Our activities are constructed the way children don't even know they learn.
To generalize our philosophy is to:
- help your children fully develop emotionally, physically, socially, intellectually
-  to open your child's creative capability, and help to accomplish full development of your child
- to teach them how to be independent and liable people
- to prepare them for school education
- to help and assist parent's in parenting
In the education process we use Piaget's Theory, so ""learning by playing and having fun"".
Our preschool classes are adequately prepared for children's age. We teach showing children what's around them so our
curriculum is based on seasons, weather,  holidays and more...
In our curriculum there's everyday time for:
- learning letters, sounds and words (in Polish and English)
- math (numbers, sizes, comparisons, time etc.)
- music - moving and grooving- (singing, dancing...)
- science
- art and a lot more.....
Our three golden rules are:
- to give children respect, warmth and love, so they feel like home
- to make the environment healthy and safe
- To help develop wonderful people
We enroll children 2-6 years old. We are open from 6.30 am to 6.00 pm.
We serve healthy and YUMMY Polish food. We offer 3 full meals a day plus a lot veggies, fruits and milk, for which we
received a State Grant - so you can be sure your child is always full and healthy eating.
We teach Polish and English and show our children the beautiful cultures and traditions of Poland and USA, but also try
to show them the differences and similarities in cultures of people all over the world. We want our children to be the
Citizens of the World.
If your child is not potty trained that's OK - we can help.  With your assistance at home we do our best to let them seat
where they should :-) Just bring the diapers and wipes until your child need it.
We would also like to introduce our teachers who were educated in Poland. They are The Best of The Best. They not
only are teachers - they are friends of yours and your children. They are warm, understanding and patient... and a lot of FUN. 
If you are unable to pay for daycare by yourself, we can help to get you the financial help from DHS.";"http://happykidspreschool.org/ENGLISH.php";;;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://happykidspreschool.org/images/20140122_154732c.jpg";"http://happykidspreschool.org/images/20140122_153650.jpg";"http://happykidspreschool.org/images/20131223_153607.jpg";"http://happykidspreschool.org/images/j1.jpg";;

We encourage all parents to get actively involved in your child’s education. Though children learn many of the key foundational literacy skills in school, repetition and practice at home reinforces those skills. Remember, you can become your child’s most influential teacher. The actions, conversations and connections you have at home are vitally important to their success. Read to your child. Teach him/her about responsible and safe screen time as they navigate online.

Being the lucky parents of boy/girl twins, Mark and Della’s initial creation ""Fantasy Kingdom"" opened fall of 2004 and closed summer of 2012. Fantasy Kingdom was the first of its kind – a ""learning through play"" facility in Chicago which gave families the flexibility to pop in and play during the week without having to sign up for scheduled classes.

Their next dream came true when Creative Scholars Preschool opened in April of 2009. The environment within is warm and nurturing. With a more structured focus on building the early academics necessary before entering elementary school, Mark and Della and their Director, Mary Ann Fogg created a preschool community for children and their families to be part of a life-long love for learning as well as life-long friendships. Creative Scholars Preschool is a safe, engaging, collaborative place for children to learn. With a focus on early literacy development, fine arts, and foreign language, Mary has developed an appropriate curriculum that enables her teachers to discover the unique gifts each child possesses.

Our mission is to provide superior childcare service in conjunction with an educational and developmentally appropriate program designed to nurture the ""whole child"" - intellectually, physically, imaginatively, emotionally and socially.  Little Hands Learning Center has developed a curriculum that is designed to challenge and stimulate each child on a daily basis and ultimately instill a lifelong love of learning.  Little Hands Learning Center promotes an environment that fosters critical thinking, problem solving skills, and social development through structured activities and active engaged learning. Our center's commitment to excellence is critical in these formative years for your child's overall growth and development.

The quality of our program will be seen in the professionalism of the staff, classroom environment and the schedule.  We have carefully designed an age appropriate curriculum based on the principle that children need to engage in ""hands on"" learning activities in addition to classroom teachings to maximize their learning potential. We emphasize “hands-on” learning for children ages two through five with a curriculum focus in reading, math, science, logic, foreign language, music & movement, cultural appreciation and fine arts. The curriculum and program is structured at a pace to accommodate each and every child.

Our dedicated staff consists of passionate, caring, professional and experienced teachers and teaching assistants who have exceeded the necessary criteria in early childhood development. We require that all members of our staff are certified in CPR and First Aid.  We also require that our staff participate in various continuing education workshops to ensure that they are knowledgeable of new teaching techniques which may be incorporated into their teaching practices.

Our program activities are geared toward developing a fun and creative learning environment that is enjoyable for children. Some of our featured activities include Educational Field Trips, Foreign Languages, Global Enrichment Program, Multicultural Activities, Dance, Movement & Music, Math, Science Projects, Computer Lab, Special Guest Speakers, Self Esteem and Social Activities.

We also have a variety of ways in which parents can become involved in the school.  We offer Parent Workshops, Field Trips (parent chaperones are encouraged), Event Planning Meetings, an annual October Funfest, Pretty In Pink Tea Social (for mothers and student), a Father’s Fall Feast (for Dads and student), a Spring Production and a Preschool Graduation. In addition, LHLC offers a Newsletter (A Little Handout - The Official Newsletter of LHLC),  a Parent Bulletin Board which posts all correspondence items sent home for the week, and annual Parent/Teacher Conferences, progress reports & assessments of each child. Little Hands Learning Center practices an open door communication policy and we encourage a healthy dialogue between parents and staff.

We encourage you to set up a private tour or attend an orientation to view the school and learn more about our program, facility and curriculum. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to call us at 773-445-9000 (the Beverly facility) or at 773-324-6500 (the South Shore/Hyde Park facility).";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/";;"Monday-Friday  7:00am - 6:00pm";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/job-openings.html";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/Registration.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/Logo_2008_-_Both_Schools_-jpeg_website.jpg";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/4th_picture.jpg";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/October20_082.jpg";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/First_picture.jpg";"http://www.littlehandspreschool.com/First_picture.jpg";;

The inpetus to learning begins at the preschool level. It is therefore our mission to make the preschool experience at West Austin a remarkable one. Students steer their way through the learning process with both self selected activities and direct teaching tools and are assisted by instructors. Preschoolers are well prepared for the academic and social challenges they are faced with as they transition from preschool to grammar school once they leave West Austin.

Monthly field trips along with varied monthly academic and cultural themes broaden our student's learning horizons. In a ten month period, students are exposed to ten different cultures and the differences which make those cultures unique. 

Our dietician prepares delicious home style meals that are both nutritionally enriched and lovingly prepared. Students practice family style eating while instructors impart proper manners and nutritional education during meal time. 

The West Austin Development Center is distinctively committed to ensuring that the programs and practices are on the cutting edge of early childhood development. Our programming professionals work diligently and are constantly seeking new ways to promote the best learning experience and outcomes for each of the students.

We encourage children to explore, problem solve, and make sense of the world by using Montessori as well as non-Montessori materials.  Our classrooms contain a variety of manipulative, verbal, mathematical, linguistic, and play based areas.  Activities at Panda Montessori coincide with each child’s developmental needs: cognitive, physical, social, and emotional.

    to surround the child with staff members of integrity and imagination. Each have a genuine concern for and sensitivity towards all children.

Leigh. It was incorporated as the Douglass-Tubman Youth Ministries, Inc. as a 501 © (3) corporation and remains under the leadership of Rev. Leigh.  Gradually, the organization hired staff and expanded to include a structured afterschool program and employment training.  In 1960, Douglass-Tubman was offered the opportunity to lease a former pre-school and Head Start facility in the Austin community.  The organization converted this facility into a daycare center and undertook further programmatic expansion.  From this 15,000 square foot, single-story facility at Chicago and Lavergne Avenue, The Douglass-Tubman today provides comprehensive family support services, centered on the parent-child relationship.  These services include a licensed full-day pre-school and after-school programs, parent education classes, individual and groups counseling for parents and youth, and a food for needy residents of the Austin and Grand Crossing communities.  Approximately 500 individual families are served each year.  All of those served are African-American and have household incomes at or below the federal poverty level. 

Douglass-Tubman Child Development Center is licensed by the Illinois Department of Human Services. It was the recipient of a United Way Venture Grant, and is funded by the City of Chicago as well as the State of Illinois. The organization maintains working relationships with social service agencies serving the Austin and North Lawndale communities, including the Wholistic Center, Lutheran Family Services, Love in Action Ministry, and Cook County Family Health Center; as well as local schools and area churches.

We teach our day care children how to read, write, and perform basic arithmetic which enables them after graduating kindergarten to be ahead of other children in first grade. Studies have shown that children who enroll in early childhood educational programs are more likely to obtain a postgraduate degree. Some of our children have also gained admissions to selective enrollment elementary schools. In the past with parents' request we have also prepared children to gain admissions into these selective enrollment elementary school (gifted programs).

Our school currently has one Community (ages 15 months to 3 years), two Children’s Houses (ages 3 to 6 years), and a Saturday morning Parent-Child Class (3 to 18 months). Our elementary classroom is open and we are currently accepting application. Parents with children who are 6 years old and have previous Montessori experience are welcome to apply.

Part of our commitment to quality Montessori education is to mentor and/or sponsor interested persons in becoming trained. To date, Gateway has helped 6 persons acquire their Montessori diplomas.

All our guides (teachers) hold Montessori diplomas as well as college degrees, and all our classrooms are equipped with AMI-approved Montessori materials. Gateway is licensed by both the Illinois Department of Child and Family Services and the City of Chicago.

Currently the program benefits the families of 467 preschool children and 72 pregnant women, infants, and toddlers in the seven counties served by C.E.F.S. Head Start offers both a preschool center-based program for children ages 3-5 and a home-based program for all children and pregnant women.

Head Start is serving children in 7 Illinois Counties including: Christian County, Clay County, Effingham county, Fayette County, Montgomery County, Moultrie County, Shelby County.

Head Start provides comprehensive services which include not only educational experiences, but also focuses on nutrition, medical, dental, and mental health access, and transportation. Because family life is the key to the growth and enrichment of every child, Head Start, together with community partners, offers opportunities and support to improve the entire family’s quality of life. Parents can participate in Head Start by volunteering in the classroom and serving on the policy council and parent committees.

The goal of the Head Start 0-5 Program is to help all children reach their full potential. This is why up to 10% of the Head Start’s enrollment can be “over income” families. Plus, a minimum of 10% of the slots are made available to special needs children regardless of income.

We opened our doors in 2008 and have been proud to serve our community ever since.

We serve children from ages 2 through 6. Our center offers three spacious classrooms stocked with plenty of toys and educational materials and painted and furnished with bright, cheerful colors that instantly captivate the imaginations of our children. In addition, we have a large, enclosed outdoor play area complete with many slides and climbing areas that we use every single day, weather permitting. We also have a fully-stocked kitchen where we personally prepare every single meal enjoyed by the children of Little Red Riding Hood, Inc. You may find pictures of our center located throughout the other tabs of this website but please do not hesitate to contact us in order to arrange a visit!

The classic tale of Little Red Riding Hood, or ""Czerwony Kapturek"" as it is known in Polish, tells of a little girl who sets off through the woods to visit her grandmother but is met along the way by a mischievous wolf. The wolf succeeds in learning where the young girl's grandmother lives and is able to arrive there first, devouring the poor grandmother and planning a similar fate for Little Red Riding Hood. Fortunately, a brave hunter intervenes just in time and is able to save both Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.

We take this story as the inspiration for our daycare because, much as Little Red Riding Hood was fooled and almost eaten by the wolf because she was travelling alone, our children need our help and guidance in order to thrive as they grow up in the world.

Our philosophy is based on the knowledge that all children are unique, with individual potentials and gifts which must be discovered and nurtured to fruition. We believe that every child has their own time-clock for development, and that the only person they need to be better than is who they were yesterday. Our teachers work hard to determine what each child knows and what they are capable of. Then we create an individualized program especially designed to build upon that knowledge, and to enhance not only the quality of learning, but the love of learning as well.";"http://www.czerwonykapturekchicago.com/home-en.htm";;;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.czerwonykapturekchicago.com/logo.jpg";"http://www.czerwonykapturekchicago.com/classrooms/pszczolki.jpg";"http://www.czerwonykapturekchicago.com/classrooms/misie%20.jpg";"http://www.czerwonykapturekchicago.com/classrooms/sowy.jpg";"http://www.czerwonykapturekchicago.com/classrooms/plac%20zabaw.jpg";;

After working for two years in the childcare industry, Francine found many flaws with the way in which they were run, and the enormous cost parents were paying for below average child care. Francine’s goal was to create a safe, loving and nurturing environment that made parents feel comfortable while they were at work, while ensuring that their children were educated and prepared for their futures. She also wanted to make sure that this could be done at an affordable price for the working families of the Gurnee community.

In 2005, Francine decided to take her vision to the next level, and located a new building in McHenry Illinois, that would accommodate about 100 children. She knew that by applying the principles she founded the in-home daycare center on to a larger group of families, she could impact many more children. The facility opened in April of 2005 with a few children enrolled. Within weeks, the McHenry facility grew quickly, and reached its capacity by the end of the Spring of 2005. Parents enjoyed the creative environment that was provided and appreciated that the price was reasonable. With the help of a wonderful staff, the McHenry childcare center was the place to be

In 2008, with the help of her husband Brian, Francine decided to expand the business into a new venture in Volo Illinois. Partnering with the Platford Corporation and First Midwest Bank, she was able to improve upon her original building design to a more open floor plan, that was even more inviting to children and families. With a truly unique design, the facility was very colorful, innovative and functional, in order allow each child to reach their potential. The staff was trained on many new techniques on how to care for and educate children of all ages. The Volo facility reached its capacity within the first 4 months of opening.

In 2009, the lease at the McHenry facility was ending and there was an opportunity to build a free standing facility down the road. This building design would take some of the advancements from Volo, and put them into a larger facility, to accommodate the waiting list of families that wanted to register for the program. In November 2009, A Child’s Place officially moved into it’s current home in the Adams Commercial Park. With the help of the State Bank of the Lakes, Francine was able to reach her dream of owning her own facility, and designing it to meet all of the needs of a State of the Art childcare center. The large open floor plan, with a true indoor gymnasium, and new equipment raised the expectation level for the parents of McHenry, who truly deserved it. The children love coming to their “Apple” school every day.

The future of A Child’s Place is very bright. In August of 2011 the Big Hollow School District, in Ingleside Illinois, contracted with A Child’s Place of Volo to run an on-site before and after school program. It is very exciting to know that a school district would trust our center on operating such a project. Currently the Big Hollow program is serving over 30 families in the Fox Lake, Ingleside, Round Lake and Volo communities. Finally these families have a great environment to send their children to before and after school. In addition, by the end of 2011, A Child’s Place once again partnered with State Bank of the Lakes and Quincy Construction to purchase a lot in Antioch for its third location. This center, located on the corner of Deep Lake Rd. and Rt. 173, will serve Antioch, Lake Villa, and the many commuters coming from Wisconsin. The center opened on August 24, 2012 to meet the childcare needs of the area, and allow school-age parents to have a center that is close to home. This center serves the residents of the community and families with children in District 34.We are very excited about the current status and future of A Child’s Place, and want each and every family to know that we understand that your child is your most precious gift in life. Caring for your child is an honor and a blessing. We promise to provide quality care for your child in a safe, healthy, and caring environment. We built our centers based on this principle and will continue to work hard and improve so that your child has the best childcare experience possible. Our motto has always been, and will continue to be “Preparing Children for a Lifetime of Learning”.

We pride ourselves on our close relationships with our parents and staff. We feel that it is important not only for our parents to feel comfortable with our environment, we want our children to feel at ease while learning t﻿hrough fun.

Our main goals are to provide sensory experiences, cognitive, physical, and language activities that enhance growth. We want to stimulate curiosity, exploratory behavior, self-expression, creativity, self-control, and responsibility. Children need to have interactions with caring professionals who understand children's needs while recognizing that individuals are different. We strive to help the children in our care to make a successful break from home and family to an atmosphere with trusted adults. Allowing them to acquire a sense of personal identity and independence, as well as the social skills needed in life. Our program allows children to learn appropriate behaviors for group experiences.

We are locally owned and operated by Ryan and Julie Weber. We welcome you to explore our center and see what our program has to offer.

My child care business was created with two concepts in mind:

(1) To provide quality childcare for parents working various shift, weekends, and holidays.

(2) Impact the minds of young children with positive reinforcement that will encourage alternatives to the negative factors that plague our neighborhoods.

This center is unique in that it is broken up into 2 phases.  The first phase is for infants to preschoolers. The second will be kindergarten to pre-teen.

Welcome to Phase 1. Both programs include ongoing supervision, program structure, positive youth-adult relationships, and programming with opportunity for independence and choice.

My infant/preschool program is centered around safety, security and sanitation. Hand sanitizers have been mounted in each classroom for staff usage. Disposable Potty Toppers are in each bathroom. These are disposable stick-in-place toilet covers. They are soft, comfortable, blocks wetness  and are oversized which prevents fingers/bottoms from touching germy surfaces.

The entire center (inside/outside) is under surveillance. For an additional fee you will be able to log-in with a secure password and see what is going on in your child’s class.

The core components of this organization bring a wide variety of expertise. My Director has a Master’s degree in Family Services & a Bachelor’s degree in Child Development with an emphasis in Leadership.  She has worked in day care and child enrichment settings and has been trained on everything from, incorporating health education into the classroom to Infant massage.

Some of our goals in caring for your child(ren) are to: provide a safe haven for them to learn life skills thru social interacting and sound doctrine. With the insight they learn here I hope they will be able to use it as a foundation to make smarter and wiser choices. Once you know better you should do better. If we do not invest in our kids now, the streets will gladly do it for us later.

I am licensed by the City of Chicago & The Department of Children and Family Services to operate a center with a maximum capacity of 28-30 children.  The children will be broken up into three (3) groups based on age and level of maturity.

The children will be classified in the following groups:

(1) Infants/toddlers-Sesame Babies (6wks-23mon)their classroom will be decorated with the theme of Sesame Street and majority of their toys will also reflect these characters. (2) 2 yr olds Care Bears (24mon-35yrs) this classroom will be full of Care Bears on the walls and throughout the classroom.  (3) 3-5 yr. olds their classroom  is the theme of Super Why and the Super Readers.

The center is divided into 2 major sections the infants & toddlers will have furniture and toys designed to enhance their visual perception, gross motor skills and the other side will be geared toward learning and fundamental play.  The center is equipped with computers, lab tops, DVD, VCR and CD’s so that they can benefit from various learning sources.

The primary goal of the center is to create a fun and safe setting in which children will find warmth, comfort, and understanding, as well as opportunities for movement, exploration, and self-discovery based on individual need, interest, and abilities.

We see children as active learners with the teachers serving as guides and facilitators. Daily activities help children develop a positive self image and experience the freedom to learn and grow with confidence. Children enjoy successes that lead to greater self-confidence and independence. Play is cherished and play spaces are rich with learning opportunities. Children participate in a variety of individual and group activities designed to develop language and cognitive readiness skills enhancing physical, social, emotional and overall growth, skills and attitudes which will increase their ability to succeed in life and school.

Our goal is to build your trust by being professional, dependable, honest and most of importantly caring for your child the same way we would want our own children to be cared for. We feel that good communication between parents and providers is an
important part of quality daycare. Because of this we are committed to creating a strong bond with you and your child, helping to ensure the best start to your child’s life as well as creating a community where parents and teachers learn from each other. Our staff members are partners with our parents working together to meet both the needs of the children and their families.

Our student body is composed of children from many western Chicago suburbs, including Aurora, Naperville, Oswego and Plainfield. We currently offer programs for preschool, kindergarten and elementary age students. We have three 3 to 6 year old classrooms and one elementary classroom. Our preschool and kindergarten programs are available with a half-day, all day or extended day schedule.  Extended day hours are available for all programs, for families in need of child care solutions.  For students that move into other schools beyond their preschool years at Montessori Children's Garden, parents can be assured that their children are well prepared for the curriculum of one of our nearby school districts: 202, 203, 204 and 308.

Although serving the community for much longer as the premier Montessori school in the area, our own “yellow school house” was built in 2004, with the needs of our young students in mind. We are proud of our uniquely talented and caring staff, who averages 11+ years of tenure with Montessori Children's Garden, and has been a cornerstone of our success as a Montessori school. We believe that a strong relationship between the parents and teachers is key to developing a triangle of communication - students, parents, and teachers working together for the benefit of the child.";"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/contact.html";;"8:15am-3:45pm";;"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/registration.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/images/final%20logo%20copy.gif";"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/images/school.jpg";"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/P1000841.JPG";"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/P1000634_0003.jpg";"http://www.montessorichildrensgarden.com/P1000630_0005.jpg";;

We nurture children’s growth and partner with parents to help children become independent, self-confident, inquisitive learners.

Our centers use the Creative Curriculum, through which teachers design a classroom environment that includes learning centers such as blocks, dramatic play, art, library, math and science, sand and water, music and movement, cooking, literacy and computers. Through active involvement with this environment, children learn to understand the world around them, make choices and explore through hands-on activities.

Also, our Healthy Lifestyles curriculum brings nature and sustainable living concepts into the classroom by emphasizing exercise, healthy routines, nutritional practices and environmental awareness. Daily indoor or outdoor activities that promote this philosophy are embedded into our school readiness program through experiences such as cooking, maintaining center gardens and creatively using recycled material. Field trips and events encouraging family participation are part of the curriculum at all One Hope United child development centers.

We implement the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) philosophy in our School Age programs, using hands-on activities and problem-solving to enhance academic performance.

One Hope United’s centers also incorporate group activities to build language and social skills, while time in the gym or at the playground strengthens their bodies.
