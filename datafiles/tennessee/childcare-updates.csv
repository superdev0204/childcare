As we partner, we are creating three foundational blocks in the form of three basic truths: God made me. God loves me.

We want your child to feel comfortable to be who they are and encourage them to grow into a caring, responsible young person. Each child needs to be allowed to express their creativity and their imagination. Going to school should be an exciting, happy experience. We strive to give every child the love and understanding they need to feel good about themselves.

Westside Learning Center should be a place where children receive the academic instruction they need to be prepared to enter Elementary school. This training should begiven in a relaxed and fun atmosphere. Activities are planned to be fun and educational simultaneously.

Westside Learning Center wants the staff to be fulfilled by their job. We want each teacher to feel free to express their creativity and share their individual experiences witheach other and the children they work with. We want our center to be the kind of place ateacher would want to work. Staff will be given the opportunity and the encouragement to develop them in whatever direction they choose.

This is a place where people can grow and explore their world and their place in this world. We want our center to be an asset to the communities we are in.

835171;"SACRED HEART CHURCH";"220 BERGER ST";"LAWRENCEBURG";"TN";38464;"LAWRENCE";9317626125;"http://www.sacredheartlawrenceburg.com/";;"Historically, the Precious Blood Sisters initiated Sacred Heart School in 1873. Although the first years were difficult and precarious, success was achieved through the determination of these women, the clergy, and faithful families committed to the Catholic education of their children. The school soon became an integral and valued segment of parish life.  When this religious order was unable to continue its work here, the sisters transferred the school into the professional care of the Sisters of Mercy of Nashville.

From 1873 until June of 1997, Sacred Heart School experienced many blessings. Among the finest of these was being in the presence of the two communities of religious women. What the Precious Blood Sisters began and continued for forty-four years, the Sisters of Mercy carried on for an additional eighty. Following in the footsteps of these two religious congregations, the Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus of India took up the challenge as religious teachers. The sisters continued this apostolate for two full years (1997-1998) in both Sacred Heart Lawrenceburg and Loretto.

Today the school staff, administration, and teachers, is all laity. Initially named Saint Joseph School (after the parish) a simple house served as the first facility, and then a renovated church building. In 1912, the parish built a two-story structure to replace the inadequate building, and dedicated the building to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In the mid-1950s, a kitchen, two classrooms, and indoor restroom were added to this two-story building. After fifty years of service to school and community, the 1912 complex was replaced with an auditorium, stage, office, and two classrooms facing Berger Street. With the completion of the Parish Life Center in 1990, the school witnessed a significant step forward in the enhancement of its facilities. The PLC included two new classrooms, a high school regulation gym with dressing rooms, public restrooms, concession stand, and a formal meeting room which is now the computer lab. In 1993, the kitchen was totally renovated and updated with the finest commercial equipment. The last improvements to date consist of the renovation of the school auditorium. The former stage was converted into two classrooms to meet the demand for additional classroom space.

Realizing the school serves a small community with limited resources, to date the tuition rate is only 20-25% of the usual parochial school tuition and fees. Its performance in nearly every sphere of endeavor since 1873 is a remarkable achievement; its history to date a rich and blessed one.

This was the first and only public school on the eastern side of the Tennessee River in Loudon County. Prior to the construction of Greenback School, students who wanted to attend high school had to choose between a private school at nearby Morganton and public schools in surrounding counties.

The school was established as a result of the untiring efforts of the people in the Greenback community. Through the years, despite pressure to shift to large comprehensive high schools, the people have continued to work to keep their small community school intact.

Greenback School was opened in 1921 on five acres that cost $500. In 1923, two rooms were added as well as a basement, which is still in use. The following year, a gym was purchased from a church on adjoining property. The gym burned in 1962. In 1924 Greenback High School held its first graduation service with 5 students receiving diplomas.

By 1930 the community had grown and necessitated the school’s first bus service. By 1939 the first library was added, and nine years later, in 1948, the present high school building was constructed. In 1949 Greenback School’s first agricultural building was added. It now serves as a weight room for the athletic department. Before this building was constructed, the agricultural shop was housed in the basement. In 1954 the community purchased an additional 14 acres for $14,000. By 1960, a new gym and agricultural rooms were constructed. In 1977 the high school was remodeled and a new elementary wing was added as was the current cafeteria. In 1982 two additional classrooms were built due to growth. In 1989 an office, front lobby and three classrooms were added to the existing building. With additional growth, a middle school wing was required resulting in the construction of four new classrooms and two restrooms in 1998. The last major construction was completed in 2002 with a stage area added in the cafeteria and the old auditorium converted into four classrooms and a computer lab. A building trades shop area was also constructed at this time.
In 2004, a storage building was constructed at the rear of the agricultural/vocational shop by the vocational students and their teacher. In 2006, two portable learning cottages were placed on campus resulting in four additional classrooms for high school classes. In 2007, two more portable learning cottages were added behind the school to accommodate the growing elementary department.";"http://gbs.loudoncounty.org/?sessionid=cdec0a2c3346411ea563783564b6a4e8&t";;;;"http://registration.loudoncounty.schoolfusion.us/modules/groups/integrated_home.phtml?&gid=1501620&sessionid=cdec0a2c3346411ea563783564b6a4e8";"http://gbs.loudoncounty.org/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=298147&sessionid=cdec0a2c3346411ea563783564b6a4e8&sessionid=cdec0a2c3346411ea563783564b6a4e8";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

The first school located in this community was Mt. Carmel. The one room school building burned in 1915. When the school was rebuilt it became Steekee Elementary School with the name coming from a nearby creek. Steekee is a Cherokee Indian word meaning ""big waters"". The original building was located on the banks of Steekee Creek some two miles from the present location of the school where it still stands.

Steekee Elementary has continued to change as the needs of the community expanded. In 1950 the present location was chosen and a new community expanded. In 1950 the present location was chosen and a new building program initiated to house the students. Fire again influenced structural changes when the second building burned in 1957. The building was rebuilt and ready for students in the fall of 1958.
 
In the 1960's Steekee Elementary witnessed many changes in the community and student population. As TVA began acquiring land from area farmers for the building of the Tellico Dam, small area schools were consolidated to better serve the community. Area schools which are now considered a part of Steekee were Toad Hill, Popular Springs, Jackson, Markwood, and Davis.

A building program in 1975 added a gymnasium as a separate building to the existing facilities. This served the basketball teams as well as physical education classes. Once again student needs changed and in 1985 another building program added a cafeteria, teacher workroom, resource classrooms and library to the basement area of the gymnasium building. The main classroom building was remodeled with the addition of carpeting, heating/air conditioning, new lighting, and restroom facilities. Another building program in 1997 added four classrooms, student restroom facilities and a teacher workroom. This addition helped to alleviate overcrowding and prepare us for the projected enrollment gains.  The most recent addition to Steekee Elementary was the 2001 addition of the existing library, computer lab, and one classroom.  The 2001 building program also added a beautiful administrative office complex to the school. 
 
In January, 2001, Steekee School implemented its first preschool program.  At this time, there are two preschool programs. Both programs are made available through the Tennessee Education Lottery.

Finally, over the past three years (2008-present) Steekee Elementary School has moved to the cutting edge in technology aquisition and implementation.  The technology hardware and software additions have made student learning fun and successful.  Our teachers have immersed themselves in professional development to become proficient in the use of educational technology, and are molding Steekee students into the future leaders of Loudon County!

The history of Steekee Elementary illustrates the beliefs, goals and mission statement which the faculty and staff at Steekee Elementary are dedicated to. We will continue to serve the educational needs of our students in the present and future as we build upon the rich heritage of our past.

MARY'S CATHOLIC PRE-K";"1665 HWY 45 BYPASS";"JACKSON";"TN";38305;"MADISON";7316882525;"http://www.stmarysschool.tn.org/";;"St. Mary’s has been the only Catholic, parochial, elementary school to operate for over 100 years in the Diocese of Memphis and is the oldest existing parochial school in the states of Tennessee and Kentucky. St. Mary’s School was established in 1878 to teach children in an atmosphere of faith. The original school existed downtown at Baltimore and Main.

It’s companion school, St. Joseph, served the African-American Catholics of Jackson in a parish established by the Josephite Fathers in 1919. The two schools merged in 1960. In 1900 the Dominican Sisters of the St. Cecilia Congregation in Nashville began administering and staffing the school. In 1970 new facilities were opened at the present site with grades 1-6 with additions in 1989, 1995, when grades 7 and 8 were added, and 2000 to meet the needs of a growing student population. The classrooms are spacious, providing a pleasant learning environment. The school building includes a gym, computer lab, art room, music room, library, science lab, and a cafeteria serving hot lunches.

In 2007 St. Mary’s School was pleased to announce two first’s for the school — its first 4-K program and the first football team at the school since the 1939-40 team. Our latest addition is our 3-K program which was added to our Little Angels Program in 2011.

St. Mary’s has an currently has an enrollment of approximately 340 students. St. Mary’s Church is on the same campus, providing a beautiful spiritual setting for Mass, the sacraments and devotions. The school is owned and operated by St. Mary’s Parish and supported by both parents and parishioners. St. Mary’s became the first parochial elementary school in the Diocese of Memphis to receive the accreditation of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. St. Mary’s is recognized for its faith-filled environment, academic excellence, master teachers and strong student leadership.

Inspired by Christ’s words, “I came that they may have life, and have it to the full,” we dedicate our apostolate to the education of the whole child – spiritually, intellectually, emotionally, and physically – in a nurturing environment. Fully aware of the accelerating changes in society, we work diligently to set our students on an unending pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty.

Small-group instruction, independent play in an organized atmosphere, and whole-group activities help children gain the right skills to hop, skip, and jump into kindergarten.

 As preschoolers gain more self-esteem, they may feel ready to take on the world. Our program fosters that confidence by providing activities to help children become problem solvers and lifelong learners.

The program mixes preschoolers with delays with typically functioning preschoolers in hopes that it will encourage development. Minimum staff/child ratio is 1:5.

The ELP operates in six counties in south central Tennessee: Hickman, Lawrence, Lewis, Maury, Perry and Wayne. Only residents of these counties are eligible for services. Teachers offer families a wide range of intervention services, including special instruction in the family's home, daycare settings and preschool programs. The two primary reasons for intervening early with a special needs child are to enhance the child's development to his/her fullest potential and to provide support and assistance to the family. These services are provided at no cost to the families.

The purpose of each preschool class is to provide a quality, structured learning environment. Daily activities include directed play, language circle, art, gross motor activities, snack, outside play and music. A monthly newsletter keeps parents informed of classroom happenings and the curriculum topic.

The Early Learning Preschool operates in Centerville, Columbia and Lawrenceburg. The Centerville preschool operates on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from 8:30 to 11:00. Afternoon classes (12:00 to 2:30, Tues. & Wed.) are added when needed. The Columbia preschool operates on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings from 8:30 to 11:30 and on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 12:00 to 2:30. The Lawrenceburg preschool operates Tuesday and Thursday mornings 8:30 to 11:30. Afternoon classes (12:00 to 2:30, Tues. & Thurs.) are added when needed.

The Early Learning Preschool operates year round. We close only for major holidays—New Year’s, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and one week at Christmas. For inclement weather, Centerville and Lawrenceburg close when the public schools close. Columbia does not close for inclement weather. Please use your judgment when deciding to bring your child on those days.";"http://www.tkds.org/elp.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Kings-Daughters-School/128318100536116?v=info";;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.tkds.org/map/images/educational_building.jpg";"http://www.tkds.org/map/images/educational_building.jpg";"http://www.tkds.org/map/images/ELP_House.jpg";"http://www.tkds.org/map/images/davis.jpg";;

835433;"MC DOWELL ELEMENTARY PRESCHOOL";"714 WEST SEVENTH STREET";"COLUMBIA";"TN";38401;"MAURY";9318404418;"http://www.mauryk12.org/McDowellElementary/index.html";;"McDowell School has a long and interesting history. It is the earliest school in Columbia still in operation. The school was named for Colonel Edward C. McDowell, an attorney, who gave land for the construction of a school. The county supplied the lumber, and the local patrons built it. The one-room, one-teacher school opened in 1883. John Trotwood Moore was principal from 1885-1893. 
      The original building was completely destroyed on November 20, 1900, by the most destructive tornado ever known in this area. It was decided that McDowell should be more centrally located. The former lot was sold; the present site on West Seventh Street was purchased with the proceeds. The new building was constructed in 1901. The school grew very quickly, and a new two-story brick structure was built in 1922. The stone fence that was built at that time still stands in front of the school. Mrs. Jesse Tomlinson was the first woman principal of a school in Columbia with more than one teacher. She was the principal at McDowell from 1919-1923. 
      McDowell organized the first PTA in Maury County, and through the efforts of this group, the first public cafeteria in the county was established. Mothers of the students took turns preparing and serving meals for the children. The PTA also organized the McDowell Fall Carnival. It was complete with rides, food, and games. Eventually this became the Maury County Fair. 
      The 1938-1939 school year was the last year that McDowell included seventh and eighth grade classes. The school remained a first through sixth grade school until 1969 when a kindergarten was added. The first elementary school library in the county was started in 1963 with a collection of 675 books. 
      McDowell led the way in desegregation in Maury County with the first black student in 1964 and the first black teacher in 1965 in a formerly all-white school. This occurred a full year before all county schools were integrated. 
      McDowell participated in the first Artist in Residency program in the county in 1988. The first after-school program for parenting was established here, as well as the first elementary summer school program in the county. The first public school program for four year-olds in the county was begun in 1994-95 at McDowell School. The first Girl Scout troop in Maury was founded here in 1928. It still meets at McDowell School as Troop 12. 
      McDowell School has been a leader in education in Maury County from the school’s beginning. The faculty, staff, students, and parents continue to strive for excellence and innovation.

The families who lived in the Barksdale School area at that time were required to transport their children across the city to Howell School.

In 1960, the City Council authorized the purchase of the present site and the construction of an elementary school. Work on the building began in December of 1961, and the school opened on September 4, 1962. The City Council named the school W.W. Barksdale Elementary School honoring Mayor W. W. Barksdale.

The original brick building contained 54,000 square feet and was built on a thirty-six acre tract. Total cost including equipment and furniture was $729,749.69. Engelhardt, Engelhardt and Leggett of New York City were the educational consultants. Hibbs and Johnson of Clarksville were the architects. Hugh G. Scudder of Union city, Tennessee, was the general contractor.

In 1967, as growth continued, 4,290 square feet were added at a cost of $80,000 providing four more classrooms. In the 1971-1972 school year, the Barksdale area was rezoned. Approximately 200 former Barksdale students were bused to East Montgomery Elementary and approximately 200 students were bused into Barksdale from the Norman Smith School area. In 1988, major renovations corrected problems with HVAC, lighting, roofing, and windows. At the same time, student restrooms and seven new classrooms were added at a total cost of $610,000 with an area gain of 8,530 square feet. Rufus Johnson Associates of Clarksville, Tennessee, were the architects. TDK Construction Company of Robards, Kentucky, was the general contractor. A new gym, science lab, art room, and student restrooms were added in 1996, providing 9,777 square feet at a cost of $628,249. The building now totals 76,597 square feet.

Barksdale Elementary School initial accreditation was received during the 1965-1966 school year from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools under the leadership of Albert Alcock. Mr. Alcock served as principal from 1962-1987. He was followed by Vernon Cooper from 1987-1992. Mrs. Mary M. Stone served as principal from 1992-2006. Peggy Vaden became principal in 2006 and retired in 2014. Mrs. Melinda Harris became Principal August 2014.

The community, originally known as Stringtown, was changed to Cumberland Heights in 1953. Briarwood and Shady Grove schools were consolidated to form Cumberland Heights School which was built on ten acres. The school served grades one through eight with a total enrollment of one hundred seventy-eight students. The original building consisted of six classrooms, office, kitchen, and all purpose room. In 1954, two classrooms and restrooms were added to the facilities. Later additions included a used army barracks that housed two classrooms, three additional rooms to the main building, a gymnasium, and a library. In 1968, the seventh and eighth grades were moved to Montgomery Central School leaving Cumberland Heights with a student configuration of grades one through six. A music program was added in 1970 followed by special education resource classes in 1971. Three portable classrooms were added to house two kindergarten classes and a Title I Reading program. Between 1972 and 1976 additional kindergarten classes, a speech class, Title I Reading and a learning disabilities class were added. In the fall of 1978, the school became affiliated with the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges. The sixth grade was moved to Montgomery Central in 1989 leaving Cumberland Heights a K-5 school. In 1988, a part-time guidance counselor was hired. A part-time art program was established in 1992. The original building was used until 1998 when a new facility was opened. The school has continued to improve facilities, but has taken a closer look at improving services.

Norman Smith Elementary has has seven principals since 1952. In 1991, the school was completely renovated and a new classroom wing was added. In 1996, with over fifty percent of its student population on free and reduced lunch, our school became a School-wide Title 1 school. Today, there are classrooms for pre-kindergarten through fifth grades: 1 Pre-K, 6 Kindergarten, 6 First grades, 5 Second grades, 5 Third grades, 4 Fourth grades, and 4 Fifth grades. We also have a computer lab, media center, cafeteria, gymnasium, two math rooms, two reading rooms, a speech room, a CDC (Comprehensive Development Class) room, two Resource rooms (one doubles as a Gifted Room), a School Counselor office, a Centerstone office, and an Academic Coach office.

The first school building was located on land donated by the Williams family and became known as Williams Academy. It stood where the Little West Fork Baptist Church now stands.

Through more than a century, various institutions shaped the educational foundation of the entity known as Ringgold School. Ringgold School evolved from a school for boys to a two room, co-educational school in the early 19th Century. In 1915, it consolidated with Meadow Grove, Kenwood, and Grace Chapel Schools, and a second building was erected in front of the first.

M. L. Royster was named the first principal of the consolidated (Ringgold) school. At the time of the consolidation, Ringgold formed its own school board, and in 1923, several ladies of the community formed the first Parent-Teacher Organization. Another event took place in the community which had a profound effect on the school. Camp Campbell (later renamed Fort Campbell) Military Reservation was established. Then real change came for the school in 1948, when it moved to its present location on Ringgold Road.

Since 1948 Ringgold has undergone numerous renovations, the latest was begun in the spring of 2003 and completed in the fall of 2004. This latest building program expanded and renovated the existing school facility to add fourteen new classrooms (eliminating the need for 11 portable classrooms), a new media center, a new kitchen, and a new office wing. In addition to new construction, existing classrooms and the cafeteria were renovated. Currently, classrooms are being updated with the latest in technology innovations: LCD projectors, stereophonic sound systems, document readers,and dual microphones.

Presently, Ringgold Elementary School serves students in grades pre-k through five and students attend school seven hours a day for 180 days per year. Seventeen principals have served the school since its consolidation. In 2009, the current principal, Ms. Melinda Harris, was hired.

At Ringgold, you will see that we are proud to educate the youth of our community.";"http://www.cmcss.net/Schools/schoolwebsites/frontpage.aspx?locid=RES";;"Hours: 8:45a.m. to 3:40 p.m.

A complete renovation costing 2.6 million dollars was conducted during the 1991-1992 school year and was completed in August of 1992. The school increased to approximately 90,000 square feet.

Woodlawn Elementary is located in the Northwest quadrant of Montgomery County. The population of the school is diverse. Many of the families of students are active military personnel and farmers. Student population is affected by zoning changes, the increase in residential development, and the mobility of the military.

Woodlawn Elementary is a K-5 school, serving about 780 students. The facilities include the main building, a courtyard, and two playgrounds. Each day the faculty and staff work to provide every student the opportunity to have a meaningful and rewarding educational experience.

The faculty and staff of Woodlawn Elementary are made up of a principal, assistant principal, 38 regular classroom teachers (K-5), 12 special area teachers, 5 educational assistants, and 14 support staff members who include office, cafeteria, nurse and custodial employees.";"http://www.cmcss.net/Schools/schoolwebsites/frontpage.aspx?locid=WES";;"Hours: 8:10a.m. to 3:35 p.m.

It was founded by educator Moses Fisk in 1805. Hilham Elementary probably has the most unique history of any school in Overton County. In 1806, its fore runner, Fisk Academy was granted a charter as the first school for girls south of the Ohio River. Eventually, the Academy accepted boys as well as girls, and continued to operate under private charters until 1926. The High School Act of 1921 required each county to establish and maintain at least one four year high school. Consequently, Overton County constructed a high school and elementary school building under one roof on the Fisk Academy site, which would continue to be known as Fisk Academy. Then in 1943, the school was destroyed by fire. For two years, school was held in the gymnasium. By that time, Overton county had decided to build a new school on a different site. Located behind the Hilham post office the new school would be henceforth known as Hilham Elementary serving students from first to eighth grade. Hilham Elementary remained on that site until 1966 when a new building was constructed at the site where it currently stands. Since its opening in 1965, there have been three additions to the original construction with the last addition being completed in 2002.

View Jacob's Ladder January Calendar - 2014

With low student-to-teacher ratios, Jacob’s Ladder meets and exceeds the Department of Human Services Child Care Licensing requirements. It provides speciallized care for children 6 weeks through their departure to Kindergarten. Realizing that care for children includes more than their minds, Jacob’s Ladder offers nutritious meals and snacks to feed their bodies and a curriculum based in the Christian faith to feed their souls.

Lunches are prepared daily and served family style with whole milk. Lunch, morning and afternoon snacks are included in the tuition. Three beautiful playgrounds have been designed for the center. Jacob’s Ladder is open from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, year-round.

Parents are always welcome to visit Jacob’s Ladder. Nursing mothers often stop by on their lunch hour and rock their babies. Many parents just stop by to peak in the window!

Parent/teacher conferences are scheduled in October and March. Many family activities are planned throughout the year. If you have any questions, or would like to visit Jacob’s Ladder, please feel welcome to call the director, Sally Draper.";"http://www.cookevillefumc.org/jacobsladder";"https://www.facebook.com/CookevilleFirstUnitedMethodistChurch";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab265/fumccommunications/ladder-kids_zps95a5ca7b.png";;;;;;

The school was opened in 1964 serving grades one through six. In 1993, Ridge View Elementary was renovated and the sixth grade transferred to Rockwood Middle School. In 2000, classrooms and new administrative offices were added. Geographically, Ridge View is located 1/3 mile east of Highways 27 and 70 and is approximately 6 miles south of Interstate 40 in Rockwood, Tennessee. The region is rural and offers cultural and recreational opportunities in water sports on Watts Bar Lake and the Clinch River. Rockwood is within a short driving distance of the larger cities of Oak Ridge and Knoxville. Outdoor recreational areas such as the Big South Fork Recreational Area, Frozen Head State Park, and the Great Smoky Mountain National Park are within an 80-mile radius. The communities served by the school include rural mountainous areas, small farms, and the town of Rockwood (pop. 5,774, 2000 census).

The City of Rockwood sprang up after the Civil War when a union officer, John T. Wilder, discovered an abundance of iron ore on Walden's Ridge. A trained geologist, Wilder took note of the red clothing dye made locally from ore while in the area during the war. He later returned with northern industrialists to form the Roane Iron Company in 1868. Rockwood was a ""company town"", where the majority of the population-enjoyed housing built by their employer and used currency traded in the company store. The city is named for the Roane Iron Company's first president, William O. Rockwood, so chosen because of his less controversial status in the community by comparison to his colleagues, all of whom had served in the Union Army. The city's industrial base diversified after 1905 when previous employees of the Roane Iron Company began manufacturing textiles, stoves, and dry goods. Through the years, different industries have dominated the employment base for the city.

The population is socially and economically diverse. The area has a large number of low-income families. There are currently 384 federal employees who reside in Rockwood. Today there are several housing developments, small businesses, and one industrial park in the area. There is a changing social aspect and improving economic structure in the community.

The students of SHCS come from Springfield and the surrounding communities including Adams, Clarksville, Cedar Hill, Coopertown, Cross Plains, Goodlettsville, Greenbrier, Joelton, Madison, Nashville, Pleasant View, and White House.  SHCS is accredited by the Tennessee Association of Christian Schools (TACS) and approved by the Tennessee Department of Education. Our students consistently test above the national average on standardized tests.

Students of South Haven Christian School enjoy an 80,000 square foot state-of-the-art complex, which includes pre-school  and elementary wings, administrative offices, library, and cafeteria.  This building accompanies the junior / senior high school area, which also houses a gymnasium.

South Haven Christian School is a college-preparatory school encouraging students to continue their education on a higher level.  Listed below are colleges and universities that SHCS graduates have attended: 

Ambassador College, Austin Peay State University, Belmont University, Bob Jones University, Bryan College, Crown College, Golden State Baptist College, Hyles-Anderson College, Lipscomb University, Pensacola Christian College, US Air Force Academy, UT-Chattanooga, UT-Knoxville, UT-Martin, Tennessee State University, Tennessee Tech, Tennessee Temple University, Union University, Volunteer State Community College, Vanderbilt University, West Coast Baptist College, Western Kentucky University.

South Haven Christian School has a philosophy based upon the Word of God.  The primary objective and purpose of SHCS is to train the student in the way of life as presented in the Scriptures while providing a quality, well-rounded education.  Luke 2:52 states: ""And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.""   This verse states that Jesus increased mentally (wisdom), physically (stature), spiritually (favor with God), and socially (favor with man).  Character training is an important element at SHCS.  The heart of character is obedience (deciding to do right), which will eventually cultivate an inner self-discipline and is essential to the emotional, physical, social, and spiritual well being of the student.  To obey, to do right, to love God, to love our Country, and to always measure one's attitude against the principles laid out in the Scriptures are characteristics that we strive to instill in each student, thus equipping them for their role in God's plan for their life and for their place in society.

With a focus on academic and spiritual excellence, SHCS also provides many athletic and fine arts opportunities, which completes a well-rounded approach to education.  SHCS Patriot athletics provide students with the opportunity to participate in football, basketball, and soccer for the young men, and volleyball, basketball, and cheerleading for the young ladies.  The SHCS Patriots possess several state championship banners in boys' and girls' basketball, football, and girls' volleyball.  South Haven Christian School has a reputation of excellence with choirs, ensembles, hand chimes, and art consistently placing at the top in state fine arts competitions.

The school sits on a hill overlooking fields and mountains that were once farm and pasture land but have now given way to subdivisions and commercial rental properties as the school lies near the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains.  In the early 1900's school was originally held in the Caton's Chapel Methodist Church where the Caton family whom were early leaders in the church and school donated the property for this use.  School enrollment records show that in 1927, Caton's Chapel Elementary School had a total of 89 students. 
    In the mid 1950's, Reverend Sheldon Ogle donated the property where the present school is located.  The original structure still serves as part of today's school building.  Although drastically renovated, this original section of the school is still recognizable to its former students.  This section provides a sense of history and nostalgia for its former students and faculty and instills a sense of pride and belonging for this once small community school. 
    Caton's Chapel Elementary School's enrollment grew in number as several smaller neighboring community schools closed their doors.  These schools included Williamsburg, Shady Grove, Richardson's Cove, Oldham's Creek (Boogertown), Mountain View (Locust Ridge), and McMahan School (Pearl Valley).
    The core of the present school was built in the mid 1950's.  Two classrooms were added in 1985.  However, our school's appearance was changed dramatically in October of 1990 when a 1.75 million-dollar building addition was completed.  Overcrowded conditions resulted in two more classrooms to be added consecutively in October of 1993, March of 1995, January of 1996, and December of 1997.  In the spring of 2003, a new expansion was completed to our school.  The expansion included eight new classrooms that house grades 5 through 8 and one office for our special education.  Due to expected growth of the Caton's Chapel Community, the Sevier County School System has purchased the land to the right of Caton's Chapel Road for future growth and development.

Her passion and unfailing love for teaching children led her to start a school - the Montessori way. 
 
Our first school opened its doors to just eight students in a Victorian-style home in the Annesdale Park and Central Gardens Historic District in Midtown Memphis. First Class Montessori flourished and we now have a second location in Cordova, Tenn. Our 1st Class Montessori staff believes that love for children and their education is the ""key."" Our teachers are trained in Montessori, Early Childhood and Elementary Education curriculum. Here, teachers serve as guides, monitors and observers rather than lecturers. Our classrooms are calm and peaceful and a high level of respect for the child is displayed by the teacher or ""directress."" Children freely move from one area to the next, respecting their work while constructing their ""own"" individual personalities. Accentuating an understanding of how the child interacts within the environment is a critical part of the Montessori method.

Delano's experienced staff works closely with parents to monitor student progress and to ensure academic success and good attendance, through biweekly progress reports, homeworkassignments, and P.T.A. involvement. The school also uses a parent contract to list the activities in which parents agree to participate. Parents all have accounts for ParentConnect, Shelby County Schools online grade book, which gives them 24-hour access to their students’ grades and other important information.

Learning is built on quality instruction and the active participation of learners.

We will cultivate self-motivated learners. Challenging instruction will encourage children to explore their world and develop multiple solutions for complex problems.

Children are complex human beings.

We will provide a variety of ways for children to express themselves. We will strive to support the development of the ""whole child."" Cultivating citizenship, responsibility, and collaboration are vital school functions.

Successful schools build strong, collaborative community school partnerships.

We will nurture family and community involvement.

Children's learning strengths vary.

We will offer rich, integrated learning experiences that incorporate a variety of modalities and practices.  Instruction will address different learning skill, levels, and styles in an effort to reach all students.

Children learn best when basic human needs are fulfilled.

We know and love children. We will make sure that children's achievements are recognized and they feel safe, fed, successful, respected, and ready to learn on a daily basis.

Dunbar Elementary empowers students to succeed!

Staff, parents, and community members collaborate around an energized school mission that supports achievement by every student.  Teachers work together on designing sound instruction.  Dedicated volunteers perform important tasks, and an active PTO works to support the goals of the school as well as the parents.

Dunbar Elementary is a caring, student-centered, community-supported school.

When you walk through our doors and into classrooms, you will feel it!  Our size, reduced numbers of students in classrooms, and committed staff ensure that every student is a priority.  Through challenging curriculum, enrichment opportunities, a comprehensive student intervention process, and tutorial support, your child's individual needs will be met.

The purpose of the Academy was to give people in the middle class community the opportunity to put their children in school at a tuition rate that was lower than other private schools.

At the peak of growth, the Academy's enrollment was approximately 1800 students. A decline in enrollment is partly due to people moving into the outer areas of the City, and even into Mississippi. The Academy has a present enrollment of about 65 students in grades PK-12.

The school has continued to provide quality Christian education in a positive, uplifting, safe, and loving environment.  The needs and care of our students is our number one priority.  The school hours are from 8:30 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.

The inception of this facility came about as the result of a vision from God to our Pastor, Willie H. Lester. The site where the center now stands was once filled with dilapidated, mostly abandoned, drug-infested apartments, and was a definite source of blight in the community. Through faith in God and the cooperation of the membership of Greater Pleasant Hill Missionary Baptist Church, the property was purchased from Mr. Dave Dermon.  Pastor Lester and the board of Deacons worked in partnership with the City Government to build single dwelling homes for families to help build a stronger community.

Since its humble beginning, Binghampton Community Life Center has launched a number of programs, including the Legacy of Stars Mature Adults Outreach, Hearts in Harmony Music Outreach,  First STAR Learning Academy, Tutorial Services, Career Development, and Recreational Programs.  Members of Greater Pleasant Hill Missionary Baptist Church and volunteers from across the city render their services to reach out to others, bringing inspiration and leadership to create opportunities to those who seek a better way.

We are grateful to God for this beginning, and we look to Him for His sustaining power to continue this important work. We pray that the center will provide an oasis for us and all future generations. We resolve today and always to give God the praise for the awesome and miraculous work that He has done and will continue to do in Binghampton and surrounding Communities. “To God Be The Glory” ";"http://www.bclifecenter.org/childcare.php";;"Monday through Friday from 6:30 am to 6:00 pm";;"http://www.bclifecenter.org/pdf_download/First_Star_Application_Form.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.bclifecenter.org/images/first_star_logo_1.jpg";"http://www.bclifecenter.org/images/childcare/DSC00501_FirstStarSitePicture.jpg";"www.bclifecenter.org/images/childcare/DSC00478_FirstStarWebsitePicture.jpg";;;;

From pre-kindergarten through graduation, we empower each student to seek his or her own journey and pursue it with passion and confidence. With our small class size, our teachers are available to provide individual support and guidance. We believe the impressive range of colleges and universities attended by our graduates is proof we are graduating strong, independent, young people.

As the only independent International Baccalaureate World School (IB) in Tennessee, we are providing our students with an advantage over other applicants in a competitive college admission process. Not only are Lausanne students prepared for college but they're prepared for life in a global environment.

Anderson’s distinctiveness begins with its community. The school is located in the center of one of the oldest developed areas of Bristol, Tennessee. The Anderson School community was identified as a federally funded Weed and Seed Grant area of Bristol. This program was funded based on the demographics of the neighborhood, including the rate of unemployment, poverty status, crime, and aging population as compared to citywide numbers. The Weed and Seed Program is now operated under independent, local volunteers and private funds. It is no longer funded by the federal government.  Other community programs include the Boys’ and Girls’ Club, Girls Inc., the YMCA after-school programs, the YWCA after-school programs and the city’s Leisure Services sports programs. These programs have allowed for the sustainability of many of the Weed and Seed efforts.

Anderson’s historical information begins with the facility’s construction in 1954. More recently, a Fine Arts Wing was added in 2001. Another wing, adding classrooms and restrooms, was added in 2002 bringing Anderson up to a total of 26 classrooms. The pupil-teacher ratio at Anderson is 17.7 students per one classroom teacher. That number is comparable to the Basic Education Plan (BEP) guidelines with an emphasis on small student numbers in kindergarten and first grade. The students attend a school-year that is approximately 180 days, and the school day is a seven hour day, beginning at 8:00am and dismissing at 3:10pm.

As a program of the church, we are committed to laying a foundation of biblical principles that includes the following goals:
    To accept children of all faiths, and all socioeconomic or ethnic backgrounds.
    To encourage emotional, social, physical, and mental developments through a variety of age-appropriate activities.
    To teach the basic Christian values of love, kindness, tolerance, and sharing, while encouraging children to value themselves and others.
    To strengthen family life through parent conferences, educational programs, and available resources of the church as needs arise.
    To make every effort to provide quality and affordable childcare to all families.



Throughout our programs, we encourage children to progress in the following areas:
    Learn to cope with a group situation – making and enjoying friends and sharing responsibility.
    Learn motor skills appropriate for their age.
    Develop a degree of independence and self-confidence appropriate for their age.
    Develop social skills – giving and receiving, recognizing the feelings of others, finding acceptable ways of solving problems, and learning courteous and thoughtful behavior.
    Learn simple skills in math and science, develop language skills, and develop appreciations for literature, music, and art.
    Learn to appreciate home, school, church, and community, and recognize God’s plan for us to live happily in our world.

The memories that are created here will follow your child for the rest of his or her life. Our responsibility, our duty, and most of all, our life’s goal, is to ensure that those memories will be cherished not just by your child, but by you, the parent.

We dream of children waking up on Sunday morning, excited to go to church and parents just as excited to take them.  We envision lots of smiles as they are welcomed by familiar faces into bright classrooms where they can be kids and learn in an environment that is relevant to their age. 
 
 We dream of volunteers so passionate about kids that they teach, listen, and serve with laughter.  Even first-time visitors relax as they step through the door. 
 
 We dream of a clean kid-friendly facility where many children experience God’s creativity through music, art, games and fun activities.  We see a safe environment where moms and dads are happy to drop off their kids and can worship without distraction.  We dream of a security policy that builds confidence with parents and protects volunteers and children. 
 
 We dream of children learning that they were created by the one and only God, who loves them and who sent his Son, Jesus, so that they may live and believe in him.  We hear cheers from Kids Church, where children gather for worship with Bibles and offering, to learn, pray, discuss, and make life-long friendships. 
 
 We dream of prayerful adults leading boys and girls to Jesus and beaming with joy as they accept Christ as their Savior.  We see whole families joining us and growing closer to God and each other through programs that motivate and equip parents and families as a whole. 
 
 We dream of changing our church, our community and our world by building a foundation of faith that leads to a life of devotion to Christ and multiplies the Kingdom of God, one family at time.

UCHRA Van Buren County Head Start is a federally funded (supplemented with contributions from parents and our local community) preschool program that provides educational and developmental services to low income children and families, including children with disabilities. Head Start serves children from three to five years old.  Each child is screened and has an individualized educational plan developed just for them, as well as group activities they enjoy with others. Head Start builds the foundation to prepare children for success in kindergarten and beyond.

Part of Head Start’s philosophy is that parents/guardians are a child’s first teacher. Head Start engages parents in their children's learning process and helps them in making progress toward their educational goals. Head Start also supports parents to reach goals for themselves and their families. Parent Involvement is encouraged at Head Start and many opportunities are available for participation, including volunteering, activities, trainings, Parent Committee and Policy Council.

Beliefs
Students, teachers, parents, and the community share responsibility for developing the student as a productive member of society. With the proper motivation and opportunities, students have the ability to learn, achieve, and succeed in various ways. 

Each student is a valued individual with unique talents, and physical, social, emotional, and intellectual needs which should be nurtured for optimum benefit. Therefore, positive committed teachers should use a variety of strategies to meet individual learning styles. 

Students have the responsibility to take an active part in the learning process, and they succeed best when challenged. Through encouragement, students can learn to accept responsibility for their present and future actions. Appropriate decision-making skills can be developed in a supportive environment.

Our surroundings are only one of the characteristics that make us so unique. We are committed to balancing the learning that goes on indoors with the learning that takes place outdoors as well.  Our students are involved in planting everything from pumpkins to flowers and learning about everything from ABCs to how bees make honey. The CDC staff is committed to the implementation and use of technology in every classroom.
 
The CDC has adopted Frog Street Press as our curriculum. It is an all-encompassing curriculum that covers all subject areas as well as character education and conscious discipline.
 
Our center serves children ages 6 weeks through Pre-K. The CDC educates children from teachers and staff of Currey Ingram Academy as well as students from the community. Currently we have a total of four classrooms. The Infant, Toddler, Preschool classrooms are housed in ""The Farmhouse"" and our Pre-K classroom is on the main campus in the Lower School.

It was established in 1910 with 20 students and 2 teachers.  The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools first accredited the school in 1941, when there were 13 teachers and a senior class of 53 students.  Today the school numbers 1,760 with a faculty of 118, 57% holding advanced degrees.  The student population is 91% White, 3.3% Hispanic, 3.2% African-American, 1.9% Asian, and .6% other with a student/faculty ratio of 21.97 to 1.

Franklin High School has a long and rich history of providing education to the young people of WilliamsonCounty.  It began in 1910 with twenty students and two teachers in a few upstairs rooms of the Franklin Institute, the old FranklinElementary School, located at Five Corners.  That first Franklin High School graduated three students in 1912.  One of the early principals was an educator by the name of Miss Nell Shea.  In the fall of 1926, the new Franklin High School opened its doors on a site atop a hill on Columbia Avenue. G.E. Craddock was the principal when this move was made, and he carried with him a staff of ten teachers and a senior class of 33.  Courses taught included English, math, history, science, French, Latin, home economics and manual arts, taught by Mr. Craddock, the principal.  In 1936, W.C. Yates became principal of Franklin High School.  In addition to serving as principal, Mr. Yates also taught agriculture.  In 1941, when FHS first became accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, it had 13 teaching staff members and a senior class of 53.  Mr. Daly Thompson, who earlier had served as superintendent of schools while teaching Bible and science at Franklin High School, became principal in the early 1950’s.";"http://www.wcs.edu/fhs/";"https://www.facebook.com/wcs.edu";"7:25am-2:32pm";"http://www.wcs.edu/#";"http://www.wcs.edu/enrollment/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.wcs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/About-WCS-bes.jpg";"http://www.wcs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bus-routes-zones.jpg";"http://www.wcs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/District-Calendar.jpg";"http://www.wcs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/be-nice.jpg";;

You’ll find an amazing group of teachers and caregivers at our preschools in Texas and Tennessee. Each day they focus on providing loving care and exciting learning activities for your little one. You’ll be able to set a schedule (full time or part time) that works with your family’s busy life.

We’re not only educators but we’re parents too. We know first-hand how much you want to stay connected with your child and what they are learning. Together, we chart a course for your child with an on-going dialogue to share ideas and progress. In short, you’ll be constantly informed about the development and progress of your child.

Keeping children safe during their day at The Peanut Gallery is of utmost importance. Our teachers establish guidelines in the classroom to involve children in a world of exploration, and for keeping them safe during that exploration.

Our program runs on a non-profit basis and all funds received by CFCC are invested into the program. It is our philosophy that early childhood should be a time of fun, warmth, security, exploring and discovery. Children are creative and receptive, and the staff strives to nurture and encourage these qualities.

CFCC provides an atmosphere that promotes social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and intellectual growth and development of the child as a whole. Planned within the framework of philosophy and purpose, Covenant Family Child Care’s curriculum includes sharing and conversation time; stories, songs and finger plays; creative art activities and crafts; games with large and small muscle activities; science and nature activities; exposure to shapes, colors, numbers, and letters; celebration of birthdays and holidays.

Lakeview is a fantastic school with a rich history and close working relationship with our community. Lakeview was the first elementary school in Wilson County to achieve accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

The basic goal of Lakeview Elementary School is to meet the needs of each individual child academically, physically, and socially. Although children have different abilities and experiences, we believe each child can learn. Through a sound educational program, each child must be encouraged to find success that he or she will also develop a feeling of self-worth.

Our faculty and staff offer a wealth of knowledge and creativity and are committed to each learner. However, we believe that a child’s educational success can only be obtained through the cooperative effort of school, home, and community.  By combining interaction and input from the teachers, students, parents, and community, we are able to better meet the needs of all concerned.

We have many unique programs at our school, but our primary concern is our academic focus. All areas of our curriculum melt together to provide an enhanced learning environment. We want each child to leave Lakeview with the values and skills necessary to become a good member of his or her community, along with the gift of lifelong learning and self-esteem.";"https://sites.google.com/a/wilsonk12tn.us/les/";;;;"https://sites.google.com/a/wilsonk12tn.us/les/registration";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"https://sites.google.com/a/wilsonk12tn.us/les/_/rsrc/1403058978165/about-our-school/Screenshot%202014-06-15%2017.33.42.png?height=237&width=320";;;;;

The original school, located in eastern Montgomery County near the corner of Memorial Extension and Highway 76 (Martin Luther King Boulevard), was one of several Rosenwald schools built in Montgomery County before desegregation. Rosenwald Schools represent an important chapter in the history of the United States. According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the buildings represent the “most important partnership to advance African American education in the early 20th century.” What began in 1912 as a partnership between an ex-slave, Booker T. Washington, and Julius Rosenwald, CEO of Sears, Roebuck and Company, led to the construction of more than 5,300 schools in 15 states for rural African-American children. Across Tennessee, at least 375 schools were built between 1912 and 1932. The current building is • 102,000 square feet Elementary school. • Includes a gymnasium, media center, arts & crafts, computer lab, music, and activity rooms. • All Kindergarten through 5th Grade classrooms were designed in pod areas, with natural daylight from the corridor skylights. • Outside walls built with Insulated Concrete Forms and Brick Veneer, which helps with the energy efficiency of the school.

Our faculty and staff work hard every day to provide your child with instruction that meets their needs and excelerates their growth!

Our school has received many awards and great recognitions.  In 2009 we were named ""The Most Effective Elementary School"" in MNPS.  We have received grants from both Lowe's and Target.  Each of these grants helped us to beautify our school and enrich the lives of our students.

We love having parents visit our school.  Parents are always needed to volunteer especially in the mornings delivering fresh fruit to classrooms.  Call the school for more information.  Every classroom should have a parent volunteer so please let your child's teacher know what you are willing to do to help.  Make sure your children are reading daily and ask them lots of questions.  

Our school-wide rules are: respect yourself, respect others and respect our school. When students feel safe and respected they are happier and they work harder in school. We aim to have hard working, happy students at Glenview.

The basic foundation for curriculum is through utilization of Creative Curriculum. Creative Curriculum core areas are as follows: blocks, dramatic play, toys and games, art, sand and water, library, cooking, music and movement, computers, and science discovery area. Use of this curriculum promotes children's growth and mastery in mathematics, literacy, science and social studies. This center promotes the use of sign language and basic Spanish. It has been studied that the earlier children are exposed to different languages the easier it is to learn languages later on in life.

The main administrators have over 30 years of combined experience working with children including in a professional setting. The Director has almost two years experience in running a child care center in which Creative Curriculum was utilized.

At Lascassas Baptist Preschool, our calling is to work with children; stimulating their physical, emotional, social and intellectual growth.  Our ministry is to work with families; offering programs to families who need child care, but desire a quality preschool.  And our passion is to combine them both!  By using the best curricula and utilizing the talents of our teachers, we are able to make our calling, our ministry, and our passion a reality.

Choosing a childcare facility for your child is an extremely important decision for all parents.  For many young children, preschool is the first group experience they have and it sets the stage for future learning.  We recommend and encourage all parents to visit our facility, meet our staff and take a look at the programs we offer.

Our teachers will help your child do this through developmentally appropriate activities that are geared for building physical, mental, and social skills.  Our curriculum at Stepping Stone Academy is designed to find and build on each child's individual needs and talents.  We have a progressive, hands on, structured learning program that will teach each child on his or her own learning level.

The 1975 Head Start Program Performance Standards defined high quality services in early childhood education, parent involvement, social services, and health. These standards have been the foundation of Head Start, and they have served as a model for state and local early childhood initiatives, including the state of Tennessee's pre-K program.

This knowledge of the foundations of early childhood development is based on research on the long-term benefits from similar comprehensive progams, such as High Scope, the Abecedarian Project, and the Chicago Parent Study. In 1996, the original Performance standards were strengthened to incorporate new research and higher expectations of program performance and management.";"http://www.tnheadstart.org/Upper_East.html";;;"http://www.tnheadstart.org/Welcome/THSA_-_Curriculum_&_Assessment_Coordinator%20for%20Douglas%20Cherokee.pdf";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.tnheadstart.org/Upper_East/imag000.jpg";"http://www.tnheadstart.org/Welcome/imag000.jpg";"http://www.tnheadstart.org/Head_Start_1/imag007.jpg";"http://www.tnheadstart.org/FAQs/imag017.jpg";"http://www.tnheadstart.org/FAQs/imag011.jpg";;

In the midst of this valley sits Hampton Elementary School which serves grades pre-K through eighth.

Hampton Elementary was built in 1904 on Saw Briar Hill. It served grades one through eight. Hampton Elementary existed on Saw Briar Hill until destroyed by fire in October of 1959. Between 1959 and 1962 the elementary school children met in the high school shop building and the local Masonic Hall. During this time a new Hampton High School was being built. Upon its completion, the old high school located on Highway 321 became Hampton Elementary School.

Hampton was allocated funds in 1973 for a full time Head Start program. After consolidation with Siam Middle School, Hampton Elementary was approved funds for two four-year-old Head Start programs.

Hampton Elementary served grades kindergarten through eight from 1973 through 1995. In February of 1995, a new school building was constructed housing pre-K through eighth grade. In order to meet the demands and rapid population growth of the area, Siam Middle School was consolidated with Hampton Elementary School. All classrooms at Hampton Elementary are balanced according to sex and diverse special needs. There are 18.8 (141) special education students at Hampton Elementary.

He was instrumental in securing the new elementary school while he was a board member.

In the fall of 1970 Uffelman Elementary School suffered a major fire. The cafeteria and gym are all that remain of the original structure. The students attended area churches and community centers for the remainder of that year and all of the next school year of 1971-72. The present school building opened in 1972.

To offer a top-quality pre-school education for more than 500 of the highest risk children in Shelby County annually, plus support for their families, completely free of charge.

Description
A child’s development begins in the earliest moments of life, with social and cognitive skills that affect their ability to enter school and succeed. Yet children from many low-income families are often not afforded the same opportunities to develop these skills as other children. Porter-Leath’s Head Start programs — Head Start for preschool children ages 3 to 5 and Early Head Start for children from birth to preschool age — ensure these children develop to the best of their ability and receive all of the building blocks necessary to be successful in school. Porter-Leath Head Start offers a comprehensive combination of quality home-based family services and on-site educational programs completely free of charge.

Oak Forest recently became an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School. We encourage you to visit our campus and experience all that we offer our students.

As an IB World School, we are committed to developing internationally-minded students. Internationally-minded students demonstrate the attributes of the IB Learner Profile. The IB Learner Profile attributes help students become inquirers, knowledgeable, thinkers, communicators, principled, open-minded, caring, risk-takers, balanced, and reflective.

In addition to developing the attributes of the Learner Profile, our students are also given the opportunity to develop the following IB Attitudes: appreciation, commitment, confidence, cooperation, creativity, curiosity, empathy, enthusiasm, independence, integrity, respect and tolerance. As students acquire an understanding of the IB Attitudes through inquiry-based learning engagements, they are inspired to think globally and take action.

    All students are encouraged to discuss issues/ problems that may directly affect their own learning.
    Assessment of student learning should provide students with a variety of opportunities to demonstrate their achievement of the expectations of their learning.
    All teachers are responsible for sharing their work, their expertise, and their support with all other teachers in formal and informal settings.
    Faculty, staff, administrators, parents, and the community share the responsibility for advancing the school’s mission.
