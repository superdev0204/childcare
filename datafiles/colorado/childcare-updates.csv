During the summer months there is a week long, full-day program.  The week includes three in-house days, two field trips, along with a variety of fun activities such as crafts, games, movies, cooking, music, drama, science, sports, playing outdoors, etc.  The KRU Clubhouse is located across the street from CCV High School on North B Street.

Every Tuesday is swimming and a movie and Friday’s trips vary weekly.  Some of the summer trips will be Elitch’s, bowling, lazer tag, Santa’s Workshop, Pirate’s Cove, It’z Family Fun Center, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, and Trampoline World.  The “in house” days are just as much fun.  There will be skating, crafts, hula hoop contest, water slide, face painting, and outdoor games for examples.

There are some steps to take to get your child into the program.  There are a couple of forms to be filled out, a current immunization record MUST be turned in with the application, and there is a one time registration fee of $10.00 and a t-shirt will be provided.  The cost is $14/day plus activity fee and $11/day plus activity fee for an additional child.  There is a half day rate of $8.00 if a child attends less than 5 hours  a  day.  There is also financial aid available.  Lunches are provided through partnership with Care & Share.";"http://www.cripplecreektoday.com/kids-rock-university-summer-program/";;;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;"http://www.cripplecreektoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_1131-500x373.jpg";;;;;

We believe in active learning, in encouraging children to manipulate materials, to use their senses to investigate, to explore by hands-on experience, and to search for answers to satisfy their curiosity. The classrooms are planned to include a wide variety of open ended activities and materials so that children can learn in their own way and at their own pace and level. We strive to highlight the unique strengths of every child, and to help each one become an independent thinker. 

Children learn best by first hand experience, and these experiences are the basis for new knowledge and growth. Family, community, and culture are by nature important to young children; their experiences in school allow them to make sense of their world and to further develop their perceptions. The Judaic aspects of The Garden Preschool curriculum (as all other aspects) are naturally and holistically woven into the child’s experience and are presented in a way that every child can be equally comfortable with.

Social relationships are crucial in so many areas of life, and a positive preschool experience is one of the most important keys to a child’s future success in connecting to other people. Teachers help children learn how to resolve conflicts without fighting, and they encourage the development of empathy and concern for others. 

The staff of The Garden Preschool & Early Learning Center looks forward to working together with you throughout the school year to help each child to succeed. We encourage you to ask questions about the program and to share your ideas with us.";"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/";;"7:30am-5:30pm";;"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/templates/preschool/article_cdo/aid/1838249/jewish/Admissions.htm";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/media/images/732/KvSp7327818.png";"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/media/images/55/zjdQ559659.gif";"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/media/images/55/Ckpp559661.gif";"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/media/images/55/JtsU559679.gif";"http://www.gardenpreschool.com/media/images/55/vYvp559666.gif";;

Our purpose is to provide children with the same type and quality of experience that they have at home and to enhance those experiences by capitalizing on the child’s receptivity to new learning and play. Our curriculum incorporates art, language & literacy, math, science, gross & ﬁne motor skills, music, religion, social & emotional, social studies, and sensory development into each age group at developmentally appropriate levels. From infants to school age, children enjoy a comprehensive experience in learning and play.

The summer program at CCC is remarkable. Children enjoy the luxury of going on several outings each week. These outings include events at Pikes Peak Library District, hikes to scenic locations both near and far, and swimming every Friday, to name a few. Time spent at the facility encompasses a variety of fun activities such as athletics, board games, art, and much more.

It is our job and pleasure to provide such an environment for all children involved in our program. We also operate on the belief that all children are capable and have potential, that they construct their own learning, and that they bring with them a natural need and desire to explore. This desire must be actively encouraged, nurtured, and guided. We believe that children’s learning is optimized when they are actively engaged in child-directed activities that peak their curiosity and imagination and when these activities have personal meaning to them.

Furthermore, we believe that the children are part of a larger picture of family and the outside community. Parents are strongly encouraged and supported in being an active part of the center and their child’s learning. Children are involved with the outside community through activities both at the center and outside the center.

The Children’s Corner Learning Center is committed to providing children with a safe and pleasant school environment while being stimulated in the areas of social, ethical, physical, artistic and intellectual development.";"http://www.childrenscornerlearningcenter.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://childrenscorner.honeyim.com/jupgrade/media/rokgallery/8/89568433-8ad0-4a81-d384-f4d6e83f6773/a1a0685e-c060-4dcf-f11e-c9a2c336031f.jpg";"http://childrenscorner.honeyim.com/jupgrade/media/rokgallery/3/33ed329b-b20d-43b9-adc3-eb772e09d895/cb52bac4-7ebe-4173-bd7c-845b64141f7d.jpg";"http://childrenscorner.honeyim.com/jupgrade/media/rokgallery/6/60e788a4-3b6e-49b8-d60a-217d75b24e7c/c8a5f3b4-d659-42ef-a1f4-e76fefa4d7b0.jpg";"http://childrenscorner.honeyim.com/jupgrade/media/rokgallery/b/b5b20f63-0e54-4b95-9d83-f2695b019634/839764de-aa9e-43d6-84c4-152ce3d25f0f.jpg";;

experiences and from their relationships.  We strive to support them in this process by offering many and varied experiences and by honoring their relationships with family, friends and community. 

The curriculum at North Routt Preschool uses a project-based approach to learning that honors the Reggio Emilia philosphy.  Students participate in small group or large group projects developed out of their interests and expanded by their own ideas.  Projects can span over a number of days or months.  Some recent projects include a community garden project, worm composting, and creating an outdoor marble run. 

Through a strong partnership with nearby North Routt Community Charter School and with the Clark, CO community, North Routt Preschool encourages its students to care for each other and for their community.  Collaborative programs such as library story time with the kindergarteners and PE with the fifth and sixth graders help to expand and enrich the relationships of our young students.

Dedicated teachers provide a climate that enables each child to develop socially, intellectually and emotionally. Our primary objective is to make each child feel attending school is a natural, exciting experience.

THOMAS MORE PARENT'S DAY OUT & PRESCHOOL";"7071 E Otero AVE";"Centennial";"CO";80112;"Arapahoe";3037700531;"http://www.stmcatholic.org/";;"STM Catholic is a parochial school, deeply rooted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the teaching of the Catholic Church. In the great tradition of Catholic education, we remain devoted to the development of the whole person in each of our students.

The School strives to nurture in its students, an awareness and love of God and a sense of moral responsibility. We believe that the spiritual growth of our students gives meaning to their intellectual and physical pursuits. We hold that it is only in the context of valuing their relationship with God, discovering their individual gifts and talents, and accepting their responsibilities toward self and community, that they can pursue an education that prepares them to lead fulfilling lives.

STM Catholic encourages each of its students to actively seek knowledge and understanding in pursuit of the truth. The objective of the School's rigorous academic program is to develop in each student the skills of examination and expression; to provide a solid foundation in the fundamental fields of human knowledge; to cultivate an ability to think critically, creatively, and independently; and to inspire intellectual curiosity and a passion for learning.

Also integral to the STM Catholic experience, our physical education and athletic programs serve to instill certain qualities of character; to develop strength of body and alertness of mind; and to illuminate the value of life-long fitness and health. Emphasizing self-discipline, teamwork, perseverance, sportsmanship, and striving toward a goal, the physical dimension of an STM Catholic education provides important lessons for life's challenges.

Lesson plans are posted so parents can provide positive support for new experiences at home. Monthly sessions are offered for parents to learn more about child development issues and share ideas and information with other parents.

These parents imagined a preschool where their cooperative efforts could create a stimulating and exciting learning environment for their children. They created a school where parents could play a direct role in their child's education.

Today, Cottonwood Preschool is one of a handful of parent cooperative preschools in the Denver area. We continue to have a very dedicated group of parents who are committed to carrying on the tradition of excellence at Cottonwood.

Cottonwood embraces a developmental philosophy of learning, which supports and respects the child as he/she is. Cottonwood supports the knowledge that children learn best through play and hands-on experiences.

Our program is open to children 2 1/2 - 5 years of age.  Children are supported in exploring their curiosity and knowledge of the world while working on social skills, and becoming prepared for later learning years.  Our program recognizes that children learn in their own unique way.  Through child initiated, teacher enhanced interactions your child will have many opportunities to build self-confidence, positive peer connections, and a love for learning.

Bree Schaffer is the Director of Jefferson Street Preschool and a Colorado native, growing up in Littleton. She moved to Boulder for college, attending    CU and graduating with a B.A. in Psychology and Spanish in 2008.  Bree spent the entirety of her college years volunteering for and later directing a support and crisis line, and she wholeheartedly believed that she wanted to be a therapist.  It wasn’t until she worked at a summer camp after graduating that  Bree found her true passion in working with young children.  After the camp ended, she started teaching in the Early Childhood field.  She took additional college classes to become both an Early Childhood Teacher and Small Center Director Qualified. In the process of doing that, Bree also became a Child Health Liaison through Boulder County Public Health. Her education in early childhood is ongoing and she really enjoys learning about how she can best support children and their families. She has been at Jefferson Street Preschool since it opened and loves her JSP community.

Eli Fairman, although born in Germany, grew up mainly in Colorado. He became used to being the “new kid” in school due to his father’s Air Force career and thus can understand the anxiety some of our children will encounter on their first day of school. Eli loves competing in sports, especially football, wrestling and lacrosse. He is looking forward to completing his education and starting a family. Although young, Eli’s character is evident by his respect for others, empathy for those less fortunate and his recognition of virtue in everyone. We see him as a strong, positive and encouraging role model for the students at Jefferson Street Preschool and feeling very fortunate to have him on our team.

Its dedicated team of professionals is committed to meeting the needs of and enhancing opportunities for young children, including those with special needs due to disabilities, developmental delays, and economic disadvantages.
 
In Sewall’s inclusive preschool program, children with disabilities and delays learn side by side with their peers who are typically developing. Through this immersion with others whose abilities and experiences differ, children naturally build empathy for others, leading to a lifetime of understanding and acceptance.Multi-age classrooms are staffed by early childhood educators and supported by early childhood special educators, occupational and physical therapists, speech pathologists and mental health professionals, and therapeutic interventions are provided within the natural setting of the classroom. This transdisciplinary model means Sewall’s preschool classrooms have ratios of one adult for every five children. The preschool program serves children at Sewall and at satellite sites, making high-quality early intervention more geographically accessible for families with children with special needs.

Sewall offers a nationally-recognized, four-star Qualistar-rated. It utilizes only developmentally appropriate practices and maintains rigorous standards so that it consistently provides the highest quality programs and services.

Granby Play Days Preschool uses play and creative interaction as a way for children to discover and learn. Our ultimate goal is to prepare our students to be kindergartners who enjoy learning and who are ready to learn. To reach that goal we have three objectives:
• To provide an environment which enhances social competency, language skills, emotional and physical growth and well-being, dramatic play and creative self expression.
• To provide a nurturing environment which models positive interaction with the world and others.
• To provide an enjoyable group experience that respects individual learning styles and facilitates lifelong learners.

Granby Play Days Preschool was formed in May of 2009 when it was learned that two preschools in central Grand County were closing (the C Lazy U Preschool and the Mountain Family Center Preschool in Grand Lake). Some staff and parents of C Lazy U Preschool were urged to begin efforts to offer a new preschool in the Granby area that would fill the void left by the closure of the two schools.

Granby Play Days offers a Kindergarten-prep program that is geared toward preparing young children (ages 2.5 to 5) for elementary school. We believe this can best be done by “discovering and learning through play.”

We believe that a solid preschool education prepares children so they can arrive at Kindergarten ready and prepared to learn, both intellectually and socially. Our curriculum also teaches a range of social and development skills that nurture that best practices for preparing children to learn in a group/community setting. These skills are lifetime skills that translate into long term social gains.";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Granby-Play-Days-Preschool/430899270322897?sk=info&tab=page_info";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Granby-Play-Days-Preschool/430899270322897?sk=info&tab=page_info";;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/576100_430970126982478_232556329_n.jpg?oh=878f35d1ebc4aad433ca805a4149fa34&oe=54FF27C3&__gda__=1425885565_8489f67a7bfef02e9c95f8ac2d7c2397";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1524758_568419019904254_1170842410_n.jpg?oh=fa3d78cd7dd849d1d87af6ae6b612fcc&oe=5515E351&__gda__=1427598104_b30ce8fd22034a4531ec98d22f3b211f";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1517635_569739276438895_1265685530_n.jpg?oh=886197e8e4536f5e6edb42a7c32a752f&oe=550BFB64";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10733997_711396518939836_395336045158224788_n.jpg?oh=b9176ac24244c6aee9f9320e38c70ce0&oe=54FE5173&__gda__=1427695638_e0535954f0ebcc501977e13759e311f9";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10670043_702154159864072_7568955026004888865_n.jpg?oh=3a4f72747f02084562a45d165f1a3794&oe=54D1D1A6";;

We provide a high quality learning environment for young children and their families.

Bayfield Early Education Programs has three classrooms of three to five year olds who attend school on a full-day schedule and one classroom which meets half -days, Monday/Wednesday mornings, and full day Tuesday/Thursdays.

Our classes begin the day at 8:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m. The half-day class run from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. BEEP operates an afterschool program for the benefit of working parents. Those hours are 3:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Bus transportation is provided by the Bayfield School District for kindergarten and first grade students.  Summer Camps for preschool age children are held during June and July.

Two fully qualified early childhood professionals teach a maximum of 15 children in each classroom.  The teachers use aides where needed.

The curriculum includes modified Montessori, Creative Curriculum, Zoo-Phonics, and other appropriate learning modalities.  Teachers regularly assess students, and provide parents with information about their child's progress.  The preschool also assesses children with special needs and those receiving Colorado Preschool Program care, and records those assessments with the Colorado Department of Education.

She was a Taviwach Nuche and the wife of Chief Ouray. They made their home south of the Present day Montrose along the Uncompahgre River. Chipeta was known for her compassion for peace and her steady strength in supporting her husband's goal to keep his people, the Utes in Colorado and out of harm’s way. She accompanied Ouray to Washington where she was treated as royalty and was referred to as the ""Mountain Princess."" She accepted all of this attention in a graceful way. People came to her for christening of their children and to ask her to cure the sick. She raised two children as if she gave birth to them, they were Cooroopoits and James McCook, Cooroopoits was the daughter of Ouray's brother and the sister of Chipeta. it is the custom of our people to give when someone cannot have. Chipeta did not have any children of her own. She was known for her beading, and for making clothing out of buckskin and giving gifts that she had made. She lost Ouray in 1880 due to Bright Disease.  She was forced to move to Utah along with her people. She lived to be 81 years old living in Bitter Creek where she died on August 17, 1921. Because her grave was deteriorating so badly, her brother John, with the aid of the Indian agent in Utah arranged for her reburial on the same location of her former ranch south of Montrose, Colorado. In 1925 she was reinterred at her former ranch south of Montrose. 5,000 people attended this event. Her brother John and a family friend Yagah, were the only family members who were able to make the trip.

Three small communities surround Woodlin: Last Chance, Lindon, and Woodrow. The main tax base is agriculture. All of the students are bused to school except for the teachers’ children who live on campus housing, and some High School students who drive themselves.

The Woodlin school system has a student teacher ratio of approximately eight to one. School is in session from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm Tuesday through Friday. Occasionally a Monday is scheduled to provide the required student contact days.

The school facility consists of two buildings. The main building houses the office, library, cafeteria, elementary and secondary classrooms. A secondary math classroom, fine arts department and excellent auditorium are located in the adjacent building.

The school is the center of many activities for our area. The local Lions Club meets at the school in the evenings. The Lions Club supports the school by providing scholarships and other helpful work around the school. The school is used for a variety of community events.

The school district has a distance learning program in cooperation with other school districts throughout the East Central Board of Cooperative Educational Services. This system allows the district to expand course offerings and programs for our students. A feature of our program made possible by this system is the “Sophomore Scholars” program, in which students can earn an Associate’s Degree from Morgan Community College by taking courses for dual high school /college credit in their junior and senior years. After graduation, the student can then attend any Morgan Community College campus to complete their associate degree.

Projects usually last a month or more to give young children the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the project and/or investigation for greater understanding of each topic.";"http://cres.rfsd.k12.co.us/resources/preschool.html";;"8:00am to 3:15pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://cres.rfsd.k12.co.us/images/crelogo14h.png";;;;;;

Now that a new year of formal learning has begun, students are striving to align their learning and social habits to the HOWL. By doing so, they will continue to grow and develop into productive citizens at home, at school, in the community, and beyond.
At Hoff, we truly believe all children can learn. Our on-going vision for Hoff Elementary is to maximize individual student achievement in a safe school environment where students and staff are part of a learning community.  Teachers and students alike are encouraged to take risks with new learning. Your contribution as a parent includes helping your child be at school every day and supporting their learning endeavors from home. Whether you volunteer at school and/or support your child’s learning at home by providing them with a supportive study environment, your involvement is important and welcomed.

We pride ourselves on creating a comfortable, nurturing setting that fosters self-esteem and establishes trust. We aim to understand and encourage individual talents and interests to create a positive atmosphere with regard to learning.

Our school offers a variety of materials and activities so kids can playfully explore and become better aware of their surroundings. We also engage in enrichment programs outside our facility that we believe enhance the overall preschool experience. Above all, we want our kids to have fun while learning and to have a smooth transition into elementary school.

Some of the developmental skills we work on include: fine motor, gross motor, language, art, beginning math, science, phonics/early reading, listening, and social studies.

St. Therese Catholic School has not adopted ""The Common Core"" and does not report any student information to any agencies outside of the Diocese of Pueblo.

In addition to a full academic program of Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies, we provide an active enrichment program consisting of Spanish, Vocal Music, Physical Education, and Religious Studies daily.   Student learning is supported by a wide range of field trip experiences, grade level projects, and integrated instructional technology. 

St. Therese provides a comprehensive Middle School program taught by fully certified/highly qualified secondary teachers focused on pre-collegiate preparation.  St. Therese also provides a High School experience on campus for students in grades 9 thru 12.  The program includes online course work through Catholic Schools of Excellence, a nationally accredited  online instructional program.  In additon, juniors and seniors have the opportunity to take advantage of the ""Concurrent Enrollment Program"" offered at near by Pueblo Community College or at Colorado State University - Pueblo.

This means we include children with special needs in all our classrooms. Through diversity of age, ability, and culture we believe children learn about the varied people in our society. We value and welcome this diversity in our classrooms.
 
Our program focuses on the development of the whole child through active exploration and child initiated choices. Children learn best in a social environment in cooperation with children and adults. For this reason our first focus is on the development of competent social skills and rich language. In this social environment we incorporate cognitive experiences that are appropriate to the ages and development of young children.
 
We base our program on The Creative Curriculum which supports active learning, development of cognitive skills, literacy, language, math, science, and creative expression. These experiences provide a solid foundation for future academic skills.

We are located on the campus of the First Presbyterian Church.

Our goal is to provide opportunities for intellectual, physical, social, and spiritual growth within an atmosphere of Christian love. We accept all children for the special, wonderful individual he or she is and strive to create a preschool experience that develops the child�s self-esteem and enhances learning.

Our program has a mix of small group and large group time where children have opportunities to learn through hands on experiences. ""Play"" allows the child to make his or her own choices and to practice new skills in a purposeful way. It allows children to interact with one another thus providing an arena in which to acquire such social skills as cooperation, how to express one�s needs, and to respect the needs of others. With the help of the teacher, children learn to talk with one another in order to solve interpersonal conflicts.";"http://www.sonshinepatchpreschool.com/";;"9am-3:30pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.sonshinepatchpreschool.com/assets/images/gallery/spkids/3.jpg";"http://www.sonshinepatchpreschool.com/assets/images/gallery/spkids/1.jpg";"http://www.sonshinepatchpreschool.com/assets/images/gallery/spkids/9.jpg";"http://www.sonshinepatchpreschool.com/assets/images/gallery/spkids/7.jpg";;

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama. They also take field trips and periodically hear speakers and instructors regarding particular topics of interest.";"http://mybasecampkids.org/programs/school-links/";"https://www.facebook.com/mybasecampkids";"Monday - Friday

Rather, we’ve integrated our day into a flowing schedule of activities blending the Montessori curriculum with art, Spanish, sign language, cooking, sewing, gardening, animal care, movement, pretend play, carpentry and field trips.The children are with the same consistent, mature staff all day.

Dr. Maria Montessori believed that no human being is educated by another person. He must do it himself or it will never be done. A truly educated individual continues learning long after the hours and years he spends in the classroom because he is motivated from  within by a natural curiosity and love for knowledge. Therefore, Dr. Montessori believed that the goal of early childhood education should not be to fill the child with facts from a pre-selected course of studies, but rather to cultivate his own natural desire to learn.”

Our academic focus continues to be on reading, writing, math and science with an emphasis on English Language Development when needed.  All Adams14 students receive a minimum of 90 minutes of direct reading instruction, and 60 minutes of writing and math instruction per day.  In addition, as an IB World School all students participate in six units of inquiry thoroughout the year which adds an international perspective to their learning each day.

        We also continue to incorporate more wellness initiatives into our building, including fresh fruits and veggies for all students twice per week and increasing the amount of daily physical activity children receive both outside and inside the classroom.  We are also proud of our annual youth-run farmer's markets that will be held again this fall.  Parents, students and community members can purchase fresh produce right here at Alsup, with a portion of that produce provided from our very own school garden!

         Through our partnership with the University of Colorado at Denver we currently have eight teacher candidates working with our teachers.  With the support of our UCD site professor, Pam McEwan, we are able to provide additional academic support for our students.

          I am honored to have the opportunity to be the principal here at Alsup IB World School and I cannot tell you enough how proud I am to be part of this organization.

It was originally named Breene Avenue School and was built on a dirt path that later became Quincy Avenue. A handful of students from surrounding farms were taught by one teacher.
 
Around 1900, a larger frame building was erected. By 1930 more room was needed, so a brick addition was constructed. A short time later, fire struck and building was lost. The new school, which included a library and gymnasium, was called Cherry Hills School. There were about 40 students spread over nine grades.
 
When the School District decided to consolidate Cherry Hills and Village Heights Elementary Schools, a new building was erected on the site and given the name of Cherry Hills Village Elementary School.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break.

    Students learn at all grade levels through teacher-led and student-initiated projects.  Independent study and group projects allow students to learn state standards through in-depth investigations into areas of personal interest to the student through which they become independent and self motivated learners.  Driven by constructivist pedagogy, teachers facilitate the work of students as producers and learners and students further their own learning through acting as role models and advisors to other students, and by completing projects and presenting them as part of the learning environment.
    Students work with their teacher to develop a weekly work plan known in traditional teaching circles as a personal learning plan (PLP) so that they know and can reach academic standards and personal growth.  This practice allows students to be in control of their own learning path, chart their own progress, recognize areas of strength and weakness, and actively reflect on their own learning.  The work plan enables teachers and students to track their own growth and progression towards mastery.
    Our students work towards personal goals, not simply getting exposure, but diving deeply into topics and projects.  The students’ work is profoundly relevant to each student through the personalized learning plans, student-generated projects, and consistent work with families and the local community. The small learning environment becomes a true community in which respect for and connection with each other is paramount.  Restorative justice, “Love and Logic”, class and school gatherings are central components to creating this powerful place of lifelong learning.
    Adapted in part from the pedagogical framework of High Desert Montessori School, the work of Maria Montessori and the vision of Buena Vista Montessori School.

We hope that you find it a great introduction to our school. Like our school, we want this site to be a place for you to discover things about My School Preschool (MSP) that excite you and make you want to know more. 

There is a page that highlights our wonderful teachers, who take professional and personal pride in building strong relationships with their students and their student’s families. There is a page dedicated to our unique program that merges best practices and our students' desire to learn with amazing results. There are also pages that are more nuts and bolts in nature: the admissions process, tuition structure, class schedule and programs, and how to contact us.

This website also conveys the love we have for children, the uniqueness they bring to our school, and how everyone who walks through our doors teaches respect and care for others by modeling those attributes. When you are finished browsing our site, please call the school and arrange a time to come and experience our dynamic school first hand. 

Let us share what researchers have found: young children learn best through their five senses. While visiting the school your senses will be engaged in a way that they cannot be by web page alone. We invite you to come and let your eyes see the Taj Mahal being built in the block area and children delivering letters they wrote to their friends, while dressed in postmaster uniforms. Let your ears hear the giggles of four year-olds laughing at made-up jokes, two and a half and three year-olds singing, and five year-olds trying to make a friend feel better by talking with them. Come and feel rice fall through your fingers at a sensory table, feel the coolness of finger paint on your hands, and feel the love from a teacher to a child. You might be able to smell scented play dough and the chill on children returning from our amazing outdoor playground. If you time your visit just right, you may be able to share a snack or a birthday celebration with a class, and you will get to go home with a taste of My School Preschool. 

Since 1971 My School Preschool has been educating young children in the Villages. Come and see if My School Preschool’s community is the place for your child to take his or her first step on a life long journey of learning.";"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/";;"Monday – Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. ";;"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/admissions.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/uploads/1/6/4/3/16433598/1389294116.png";"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/uploads/1/6/4/3/16433598/1389123546.jpg?250";"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/uploads/1/6/4/3/16433598/1358284401.jpg";"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/uploads/1/6/4/3/16433598/1389285788.jpg";"http://www.myschool-preschool.org/uploads/1/6/4/3/16433598/4293710.jpg?353";;

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama. They also take field trips and periodically hear speakers and instructors regarding particular topics of interest.";"http://mybasecampkids.org/programs/school-links/";"https://www.facebook.com/mybasecampkids";"Monday - Friday

The students at Red Hawk Ridge have many opportunities outside of the classroom to enhance their elementary experience. Art, music, physical education, drama, choir, technology and various clubs are some of the classes that are offered during and before school.
 
Part of the Red Hawk Ridge Elementary School's Mission focuses on the building of a community. We believe in the shared dedication and responsibility of the child, family, school and community as partners in meeting challenges and celebrating success. As a community, we will empower all students to achieve academic excellence.
 
Red Hawk Ridge is a 4-track, year-round school, which means we have children attending school every month of the year. About three-quarters of our student body is in attendance at any one time. Students attend the same number of days of school, but the schedule for time off varies by track. We serve approximately 700 students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade.

850275;"ST. THOMAS MORE PARISH SCHOOL";"7071 E Otero AVE";"Englewood";"CO";80112;"ARAPAHOE";3037700441;"http://stmcatholic.org/";;"STM Catholic is a parochial school, deeply rooted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the teaching of the Catholic Church. In the great tradition of Catholic education, we remain devoted to the development of the whole person in each of our students.

The School strives to nurture in its students, an awareness and love of God and a sense of moral responsibility. We believe that the spiritual growth of our students gives meaning to their intellectual and physical pursuits. We hold that it is only in the context of valuing their relationship with God, discovering their individual gifts and talents, and accepting their responsibilities toward self and community, that they can pursue an education that prepares them to lead fulfilling lives.

STM Catholic encourages each of its students to actively seek knowledge and understanding in pursuit of the truth. The objective of the School's rigorous academic program is to develop in each student the skills of examination and expression; to provide a solid foundation in the fundamental fields of human knowledge; to cultivate an ability to think critically, creatively, and independently; and to inspire intellectual curiosity and a passion for learning.

Also integral to the STM Catholic experience, our physical education and athletic programs serve to instill certain qualities of character; to develop strength of body and alertness of mind; and to illuminate the value of life-long fitness and health. Emphasizing self-discipline, teamwork, perseverance, sportsmanship, and striving toward a goal, the physical dimension of an STM Catholic education provides important lessons for life's challenges.

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama. They also take field trips and periodically hear speakers and instructors regarding particular topics of interest.";"http://mybasecampkids.org/programs/school-links/";"https://www.facebook.com/mybasecampkids";"Monday - Friday

“…to provide all students the opportunity to achieve the knowledge and skills necessary to become contributing citizens in our diverse society.”

Widely recognized today as one of the best urban school systems in the country, Denver Public Schools serves the residents of the City and County of Denver, Colorado.

While its roots can be traced to 1859, when the city was founded, the district was officially created in 1902 when voters approved a constitutional amendment that created the City and County of Denver. The same constitutional amendment consolidated five school districts into today’s School District No. 1.";"http://greenlee.dpsk12.org/?page_id=266";;;;"http://greenlee.dpsk12.org/?page_id=275";"http://greenlee.dpsk12.org/?page_id=324";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://greenlee.dpsk12.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cropped-Greenlee-Header.jpg";;;;;;

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break.

Stellar Stars are grown through a rigorous instruction that meets every child where they are and then motivates them to achieve the highest expectations. At Stellar, we use various methodologies to foster mastery of state educational standards. The Kagan instructional approach offers one method to facilitate cooperative learning. All learners are accountable for participation and critical thinking, while focusing on classroom and team building techniques.

The Stellar campus is working toward brain-based, conceptually integrated instruction and we meet each week in our professional learning communities to collaborate, plan, address student needs and grow as educators. Stellar shares the collective belief with parents that it is our passion to inspire our students by nurturing independence and encouraging risk taking in a supportive, positive environment. Personal accountability is one part of the dynamic of seizing a dream and setting smart goals that build toward success. We encourage students to set goals that reflect their passions and then review and revise based on personal growth.

We value parents as learning partners and have a variety of options for parent volunteer involvement, including targeted reading time for direct student mentoring as well as various support opportunities.

We are proud of our school, staff, students, and community who are all committed to our District’s Mission: “ To inspire every child  to think, to learn, to achieve, to care.”

Belleview Elementary School is a building that is comprised of grades K-5.  We provide opportunities in the areas of: intervention, enrichment, character education, Specials (Music, Art, PE, Technology, Media), and technology integration.  Our school values traditional, yet rigorous opportunities in learning.  Our teachers use exemplary instructional strategies that are flexible to the needs of our student population, and utilize multiple data points in planning for instruction.    We cherish the importance of home-school partnerships, and we are committed to the hearts and minds of every child.  We are proud to share we are a John Irwin School of Excellence and recipient of the Governor’s Distinguished Growth Award.  These accomplishments are possible due to the high level of partnerships with our staff and community (Please visit www.schoolview.org to find out more information on our school achievement.).

Belleview’s dedicated staff is a collaborative faculty whose top priority is the growth and development of the whole child.  In addition to academics, we host annual school events including  a school-wide Shakespeare production, opportunities for students’ art to be showcased in the local community, various musical performances, and an intermediate grade ballroom dancing competition, to name a few.  As a wellness school, we have adopted the recess-before-lunch model, and host many opportunities for students to foster their wellness, such as field day, running club, physical education courses, and much more (For more information on wellness, please visit our district website.).

Parental involvement is at the heart of student success at Belleview.  We are extremely fortunate to have an abundance of parent leadership and volunteers who enrich our school with their time, heart, and talent.  The highly supportive Parent Teacher Community Organization (PTCO) is a vital part of our school environment.  Our PTCO are parent leaders who host school-wide events for our students and help in raising funds for our school, which are utilized to directly benefit students and classrooms.  In fact, through fundraising efforts and the support of our community, our PTCO provided state-of-the-art technological resources such as: document cameras, printer stations, SMARTBoards, a new computer lab, and a two carts of laptops for our classrooms. We are extremely grateful for the wonderful resources provided by our community.   In our dedication to 21st –century learning, we will continue to maximize our efforts in technology integration into the classroom environment.   

We are so glad you are a part of the Belleview family.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should have any questions, comments or concerns.

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama.

Our center strives to provide high quality services to local families in need of preschool and childcare options.

We were established in 1979 by the Park Hill United Methodist Church to fill a growing need in the area for half day, full-day and after school care options.  Our non-profit organization was created as an outreach program, with a non-denominational, developmentally appropriate curriculum and philosophy. Children of all religious and cultural backgrounds are welcome.

For more than 30 years, the Children’s Center has served young families in our community by  providing options that support the rich tradition of diversity and the values of our neighborhood.

We understand that choosing a caregiver for your child(ren) is an enormous decision for families.  To that end, we are available for touring Monday – Friday between 10am and 6pm.

I am honored to be a principal of a school where a genuine love for children, high expectations and character building are a priority. The staff at Dakota Valley Elementary is committed to helping each child reach his or her potential academically, socially and behaviorally.
 
You will find Dakota Valley Elementary School to be a very safe, welcoming and student-centered environment where students can grow and learn. I am fortunate to have a staff that values this philosophy while also setting very high standards for student learning. We are a preschool through 5th grade building with more than 800 students. Though we are a large school, we have maintained a family-like atmosphere with our four track calendar.
 
We recognize that parents are our students’ first and best teachers. We encourage our parents to be active partners in the school, ensuring the success of their children. We have a very active Parent Teacher Organization, many opportunities to volunteer in the school and classrooms, and a strong PASS (Partnership for Academically Successful Students) committee. All provide many, many opportunities to get involved. Additionally, we typically have over 90% attendance at Parent-Teacher conferences illustrating that parents are also committed to helping us achieve our mission of student success.
 
I would like to encourage you to explore our website to learn more about our curriculum, staff, programs, activities and classrooms. We are extremely proud of the accomplishments of our students and staff and we hope you enjoy Dakota Valley Elementary School.";"http://dakotavalley.cherrycreekschools.org/Pages/default.aspx";;"9am-3:30pm";;"http://dakotavalley.cherrycreekschools.org/Pages/Registration.aspx";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama. They also take field trips and periodically hear speakers and instructors regarding particular topics of interest.";"http://mybasecampkids.org/programs/school-links/";"https://www.facebook.com/mybasecampkids";"Monday - Friday

Dream Big began in January 2006 with one class of four students (see Lisa Lang's staff profile picture).  It was a small class with big dreams!  Eight and a half years later, we have now grown to offer over 60 classes in and around the Chicagoland area, serving over 500 students weekly.  We currently offer our classes in Andersonville and Lakeview as well as in numerous schools including Bell, Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School, Boone, CICS-Irving Park, Hawthorne, Howe School of Excellence, Montessori Academy of Chicago, Newberry, Peirce, Pritzker, Solomon Schechter, St. Stanislaus-Kostka, Suder Montessori, Wildwood and Willa Cather (Super 7 Girls). We also partner with JCC Apachi Northside, Source 4 Chicago and various other non-profits to fulfill our mission of accommodating ALL students. (If you have a financial need, please let us know how we can help. We will never turn anyone away based on their ability to pay.) We are proud to announce additional programming for students in Saugatuck, Michigan and Phoenix, Arizona.

Dream Big Performing Arts Workshop offers a variety of drama classes to children ages 2-18.  Our classes are designed to foster creativity, self-expression and teamwork and, of course, to be a whole lot of fun!  All of our teachers have had years of experience in theatre as professional performers, directors, choreographers and/or writers and have a passion for teaching kids in the performing arts.  Some of our most popular classes include musical theatre, improvisation, story drama and, of course, our creatively themed 1-week drama camps!

We started Teen Camp in 1988 after realizing that 11 and 12 year olds had different interests than 8 year olds and deserved their own program!  Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and the school district recognize the difference at age 11.  By this age, young teens talk, think, and act differently, and are ready for a program that respects and challenges them.  TeenCamp provides fun, safe, challenging, wholesome, age-appropriate activities for 11 – 15 year olds.

Integrity, Courtesy and Respect are the cornerstones of how TeenCampers treat each other and the community.  Each teen is expected to sign a Code of Conduct.  Most of our teens find long term friends who stay in touch throughout the year.  In addition, we take the opinions of the teens seriously and allow them to have input into the program whenever possible.   Within the limits of time, cost and appropriateness, teens can change the program.  No one else in our community offers a program for this age group and no one else could do it like this!

TeenCamp typically costs $50 per day or $225 for a full week.  There is an additional $10 if you choose to sign up for extended days when we go out for dinner as a group after our trips to Water World and Elitches and $45 in addition to daily charges for the two camping trips.  See the registration for a full explanation of charges.";"http://youngpeopleslc.com/teencamp/";;;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://youngpeopleslc.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/cropped-logo-yplc-web.jpg";"http://youngpeopleslc.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sierra-012.jpg";"http://youngpeopleslc.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sierra-041.jpg";;;;

Our school nurtures creativity, individuality, and independent thinking so children have vast opportunity to pursue educational excellence, thus entering their community and the world with confidence, competence and compassion.

Juniper Ridge Community School is a multi-cultural K-7 charter school using an arts and nature-based curriculum rooted in the Waldorf tradition. A great body of research suggests the Waldorf approach of using art, nature, and a unique understanding of child development helps all children—regardless of aptitude or socio-economic status–reach remarkable academic and personal success. Waldorf-inspired graduates love to learn and continue to seek knowledge far beyond the last day of school, becoming highly valuable leaders and community members.";"http://juniperridgeschoolco.org/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Juniper-Ridge-Community-School/378292775613496?ref=stream";;;"http://juniperridgeschoolco.org/enrollment/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://juniperridgeschoolco.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/JuniperRidgeSchool.png";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1378553_438346519608121_1608135085_n.jpg?oh=7ffcf0a8ed584a8de1b74192bac3d4e0&oe=5503EFDC";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1231297_438650462911060_1808020124_n.jpg?oh=f1a706d5480b8845cf9ea5ac531ae0a7&oe=54FCB5C8";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash2/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/995474_419278811514892_1049911346_n.jpg?oh=561496018fe8b47544329b2e4b8b187a&oe=55135998";;;

Every child is like a snowflake, no two are the same and each is unique. We at Cherry Hill Learning Center believe that, like snowflakes, each and every child is born a unique individual. The philosophy of Cherry Hill Learning Center is to help create an atmosphere in which a child's unique qualities can be embraced and developed. We encourage their individuality by supporting cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development. We believe that age- appropriate activities are the best way to develop these qualities.

Cherry Hill Learning Center aims to instill qualities in children that will be beneficial to them as they grow. We encourage self-esteem, and responsibility. We want children to feel that they are important, and that they are valuable to society. By promoting these traits, we are able to give children skills to be successful in their future.

offers an educational continuum from infants through the sixth grade. We offer a safe and nurturing educational environment in a Montessori setting. We believe, in our Montessori environment, that every child will become competent, confident, compassionate, and above all capable. We know that within each child is the seed of unlimited potential which will guide that child into adulthood. In our day care center as well as our private school, we emphasize an individualized educational experience as opposed to a strict “one size fits all” based education. At AML we utilize many different modalities to teach and achieve our developmental and educational goals.

Recent research shows that at least 80 percent of a child’s brain development occurs by the age of three. It further suggests that as much as 30 percent of a youngster’s brain capacity can be lost without a nurturing early environment that encourages learning. At Adventure Montessori we believe that the most important years of a child’s education are not high school and college, but the first six years of life. As a result, Adventure Montessori regards infant and early childhood education as the very foundation of everything that follows. Our goal is to treat each student on an individual basis producing self-discipline and a life-long love of learning.

At Adventure Montessori, each child is educated in accordance with their own rate of development. Our focus is to continually stimulate each individual student through an enriched educational environment consisting of activities, materials, and extensions that promote experimentation at every developmental level. Our school proudly features an orchard, vegetable gardens, and our very own animals. Following the the philosophy of Dr. Maria Montessori, we believe, as she did, that within each child is the seed of unlimited potential, that simply needs to be nurtured, and allowed to grow at it’s own pace. So, in essence, we offer each child, the world on a silver platter knowing that the combination of our educational environment coupled with each child’s innate curiosity will promote independence, exploration, and creativity within each child.";"http://www.adventuremontessorilive.com/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/AMLLafayetteCO";"Mon - Fri:

We are located about one mile East of Santa Fe and about one mile West of Broadway on Mineral in the Westview Shopping Center in Littleton, Colorado.

Small World Learning Center is a family owned and operated childcare center for children ages six weeks to six years old. We pride ourselves in the fact that we are not a “corporate” or a “franchised” daycare center. Working in larger corporate centers is where we began our careers and fell in love with child care. We learned so much from a select group of people and for that we are grateful. While the big corporate centers meet the needs of many, there are some families that need just a little extra care and love. Each family and child is different, with different needs. Not every child learns in the traditional style. Our teachers have the ability to design their classroom curriculum to best fit the needs of the children. This flexibility allow us to truly serve the community that we live in.

Small World Learning Center currently has four class rooms: Infants, ages six weeks to 12 months; Young Toddlers, ages 12 months to 24 months, Toddlers, ages 24 months to 36 months; Preschool / Pre-kindergarten ages 36 months to 60 months. The safety and happiness of the children in these classrooms are our priority. We understand that it takes a special person to work with young children all day and we feel we have selected the perfect staff. Each staff member is certified in CPR, first aid and universal precaution. Each teacher is expected to know each child individually. By doing this, our teachers create and teach a curriculum that suits the class. Our goal is to fashion an environment where the children do not even know they are learning because of the creativity and love that is shown.

We have competitive pricing and schedules. We are happy to offer several discounts to help our families during these tough economic times. In most case we can find a schedule that works well for each family.

Our facility is secure. The front door has an individual code for each family and staff member. All the outside doors are locked for the security of the children.

Our facility is designed with large classrooms; this enables us to have plenty of space for learning centers and nap time. Our staff is thoroughly trained in the daily and closing routine of the center, so that, we can offer you a clean and inviting environment.

We look forward to hearing from you. Please call and schedule a tour today.";"http://www.littletoncodaycare.com/";;"Mon - Fri:

In 2004 this group sought out Martha Teien and invited her to direct a new Montessori program, based on their past experience with her as a Montessori Educator.  In a matter of months the founders were able to find the right location, raise enough funds, and donate their own time to create a primary school for their children and the children of the Vail Valley. 

These founders and their director, wanted to create a school that provided exceptional early childhood education for Eagle County children.   They believed the way to accomplish this was to:
    Build a school with excellent teachers who were passionate about their work and about the children
    Create stability for the children by having the same teachers each day versus different teachers on different days
    Provide a classroom and playground that promotes learning, creativity, exploration and responsibility 
    Take care of our teachers by treating them as real teachers and not as just as care givers, provide a work environment that allows for balance of life, and encourage yearly  professional development in order  to promote commitment and longevity of tenure
    Finally, the founders believed strongly in Martha Teien's philosophy of allowing ""What is best for the child?"" to continually guide the school.
     

Mountain Montessori would like to recognize Alice Ruth, Ron Alvarez, Michele Evans, Patti Hardenbergh, Glen Davis and Matt Shapcott  for their faith, generosity and personal investment.  They worked incredibly hard to make an idea they had in the summer of 2004 become a reality in November 2004.

    Kohl has long been known for its quality staff and strong academic program. We have seasoned, experienced staff that are willing to go the “extra” that it takes for children to learn. Our curriculum is based on the State Standards and drives our instructional practices. Our assessments offer regular “snapshots” of student’s performances that determine how we differentiate our instruction so all students can reach their full potential. We have high growth rates based on the CSAP assessment every year.

    We have an inclusive multi-intensive intensive learning classroom here at Kohl. Students are provided an individualized program to meet their unique needs, which includes a strong peer interaction component and an inclusive environment where all students learn from one another.

    We also have one of the strongest Response to Intervention (RtI) programs in the state where ALL students receive the support they need to be successful. Our classroom teachers and our intervention team are HIGHLY trained and work together to provide the support that each child might need.

    We have strong parent involvement! Not only do we have a very active PTA and school improvement team called SAC, we have a large amount of parent volunteers who work in the classrooms on a daily basis. If you are looking for a school that welcomes parents as partners, this is the school for you. 

    Kohl has a traditional calendar with school beginning in the middle of August and finishing up the end of May. We have many activities throughout the year planned that are both educational and fun for our students and their families. Please check our calendar for all the opportunities we provide.

The world changes at a rapid rate.  Our students today will have an average of 16 jobs over their lifetimes, most of which have yet to be invented or created.  No longer are teachers the dispensers of facts or knowledge.  Our charge is to teach students how to think critically, be creative, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively.  In short, how to think and solve problems.  Our approach to education can not be the way it was when you and I attended school.  In fact, it can’t even be the same as it was last year.  In addition, we look at educating the whole child, hence our motto “Timber Trail, Where Hearts and Minds Connect”.  We truly believe and live this mission every day.

In 2010, we changed our name to Early Connections Learning Centers.  Though it was difficult to part with the history and tradition associated with “Child Nursery Centers,” it had become apparent that we needed a new name that better reflected our broad range of services for children and families.

We take pride in continuing the legacy of our founding mothers in providing high quality, comprehensive early care and education for ALL children.";"http://www.earlyconnections.org/enrollment/locations/full-day-centers/south-chelton/";"https://www.facebook.com/EarlyConnectionsLearningCenters";;"http://www.earlyconnections.org/get-involved/employment/";"http://www.earlyconnections.org/enrollment/steps-to-enrollment/";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.earlyconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/hisbldg.jpg";"http://www.earlyconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/DSC_0015.jpg";"http://www.earlyconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Danielle.jpg";"http://www.earlyconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/DSC_01371.jpg";;

Traditional Montessori Materials: You will see traditional Montessori materials in the classroom including sensorial, language, mathematics, practical life skills, science and cultural materials. Why Montessori? Maria Montessori was a remarkable lady, being the first woman to earn a doctor’s degree from the University of Rome in 1896. Through her work with handicapped children and later children from the slums, she realized that there is so much potential in the young child that was not given a chance in grow in her world. As she began “The Children’s House,” she developed methods and materials that brought out the hidden potential in each child. Her methods and materials have become world famous spreading the Montessori approach to teaching around the world.";"http://www.rockrimmonchristianpreschool.com/contact-us/";;;;"http://www.rockrimmonchristianpreschool.com/storage/Pre-Registration%20Form.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"y";;"http://www.rockrimmonchristianpreschool.com/picture/2008-02-07%20at%2009-40-50.jpg?pictureId=9182525&asGalleryImage=true&__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1301510834610";"http://www.rockrimmonchristianpreschool.com/picture/2008-02-13%20at%2010-06-59.jpg?pictureId=9182518&asGalleryImage=true&__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1301510932249";"http://www.rockrimmonchristianpreschool.com/picture/2008-02-07%20at%2010-15-23.jpg?pictureId=9182527&asGalleryImage=true";"http://www.rockrimmonchristianpreschool.com/picture/2008-03-04%20at%2011-11-30.jpg?pictureId=9182516&asGalleryImage=true";;

Collins and Milliken, CO.  We provide early childhood education, day care services, before and after school programming and summer camps for children ages one year through fifteen years old.  We are deeply committed to the Fort Collins and Milliken communities and our downtown and old town neighborhoods.  We have posted information all over this website to help you understand all that we do, but we would love to hear from you if you want more information!  Here are some highlights:
    We work with many organizations in the Early Childhood industry to be sure we always remain experts on current early education trends.
    Our executive director, Heather Griffith, writes a monthly column for the Fort Collins Coloradoan Newspaper.
    We work with the Larimer and Weld County Colorado Child Care Assistance Programs.
    We sit on the board of the Early Childhood Council of Larimer County and are members of the Early Childhood Education Association of Colorado.
    Our programs are Qualistar rated and have classroom coaches who are Early Childhood professionals with years of experience in child care and preschool programs.
    Our preschool teachers are committed to their work with children and are an integral part of why we can provide such high quality care and education for young children.
    We have been using the industry standard in assessment tools for Preschool/Early Childhood Education/Child Care/Day Care – Teaching Strategies Gold to make sure that all our fun play-based curriculum is intentional in teaching preschoolers what they need to know to be ready for kindergarten.
    Our summer camp programs are more active than any other camps around.  We also provide camp days on school-out days when Poudre R1 or KQA are closed.
    Teenagers get camp programs just for them!
    Camp days can include rock climbing, movies, swimming, golf, park games, camping, lake trips, roller skating, bowling, Eliches, Water World and much more – check out the camp pages and schedules for more specifics!

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama. They also take field trips and periodically hear speakers and instructors regarding particular topics of interest.";"http://mybasecampkids.org/programs/school-links/";"https://www.facebook.com/mybasecampkids";"Monday - Friday

Our mission is to help each and every child succeed in their academic studies while having fun as if at summer camp. 1st Choice believes education through practical experiences is just as important as their classroom education.  The 1st Choice A.S.K. goals are to make sure every child in the program is safe and secure. We strive to help all the children achieve an “A” average in their academic studies which in turn will give more family time. We make sure most if not all homework is completed and checked by the time you pick up your child. There are no glorified babysitters watching your children. All directors, team leaders and aides are committed to making sure every minute counts in having fun yet educational opportunities for all.

Through these programs children develop academic, socialization, arts, athletic, and communication skills which instill them with the confidence and ability to succeed in their school and community.

Programs are tailored to meet each school’s unique requests, and to identify and respond to each child’s needs. A broad range of experience, talent, and skills allow our diverse staff to build programs in collaboration with school staff that respond to changing demo-graphics, backgrounds, and academic levels.

Summer Camp is an “all about fun” program that also focuses on preventing “summer slide” (a loss of previous year’s learning) and returning children to the classroom in the fall at their grade level and ready to learn. The program offers a “green” environment with children learning sustainable living practices such as gardening, composting, and recycling. Partial and full Scholarships make these experiences available to children who would not otherwise have them.

School Out Days (SOD) offers special activities on those days when school is not in session such as teacher conference days, in-service days, holiday breaks, and spring break. SOD’s are held at one or two school sites accessible to all students. During this time, the children focus on special themes such as arts, sciences, sports, music, and drama. They also take field trips and periodically hear speakers and instructors regarding particular topics of interest.";"http://mybasecampkids.org/programs/school-links/";"https://www.facebook.com/mybasecampkids";"Monday - Friday

In fact, our aim is not only to enroll the child but the entire family as well.  As the old saying goes, ""It takes a village to raise a child"" and we are looking to build a community of families who expect more from an education than just meeting state standards. Our aim is to create well rounded independent thinkers who will become our future scholars. 
We believe that children of all ages learn best through play and hands-on activities.  Thus, our philosophy of education is based on the constructivist model.  We also believe that children need a mentoring partnership between their teachers, parents and family in order to meet their full potential.  Together we can help them reach great heights, together we can inspire future scholars.

Reaching parents during those early childhood years is critical for literacy development.

We believe each child to be unique, competent, and blessed with his or her own special gifts. Our program is based on the belief that all children are natural learners with an innate curiousity and desire to explore and learn about the world around them. Central to our philosophy is the belief that children learn what they live; therefore our staff is composed of nurturing, kind and knowledgeable teachers who are excited about engaging young learners. The Nest also believes in small class size to ensure the needs of all children are being met. We follow the ""Creative Curriculum"" to guide our instruction and acheive measurable learning goals for students. We understand that families desire flexible scheduling as well as an excellent early childhood education for their young children.

For over 135 years, the YMCA of the Pikes Peak Region has been working to put Christian principles into practice through programs. We're not a gym, or a health club, or a day care center, but rather a deeply rooted, not-for-profit community service organization with a long history of success in working for the greater good.

A sense of belonging.
Everyone needs a place to belong. A haven where judgement is left at the door. At the Y, openness and acceptance abound in an atmosphere of friendship and belonging. It's where teamwork is valued, relationships are nurtured and the uniqueness of the individual is celebrated.

A feeling of trust.
Where can you go? Whom can you trust? How can you be sure? For millions of people all around the globe, the answer is the Y. A safe place where parents can feel secure their children will be watched over. A unique environment where trust, love and compassion flourish.

A celebration of diversity.
At the Y, everyone is welcome. Regardless of where you were born, what you believe in, or how high or low you are on the economic scale. It is a place where people are just that—people. A celebration of the individuality that makes us who we are.";"https://www.ppymca.org/programs/child-care/before-after-school-0";"https://www.facebook.com/ppymca";;"https://www.ppymca.org/careers/job-openings";"https://www.ppymca.org/sites/default/files/resources/2014_B-and-A_Registration_Packet_7.00.pdf";"https://www.ppymca.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/2014_B%26A_Parent_Handbook_4.01.pdf";"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://www.ppymca.org/sites/default/files/YMCA_logo_website_purple.png";"https://scontent-b-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10370451_673613396070856_3590964756084672474_n.jpg?oh=4b3d5ce7cb4792bad047ae1217343e1c&oe=55128B9F";"https://scontent-a-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10644885_680031618762367_2149739602606321692_n.jpg?oh=d146c1e13b64cb0af55b6ce1147f2be2&oe=54FF7914";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1900101_641338479298348_2043368829591367519_n.jpg?oh=b94546b69225a437d8d8f541097fcb02&oe=551697C7&__gda__=1426376174_b77226ce90b635c9f6ff8e5bd56b992f";"https://scontent-a-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10670144_652999061465623_6645418791106242485_n.jpg?oh=4a6118a745b2effb0cb3f80ad0e8def0&oe=550E8A5F";;

Today, the Center continues its tradition of offering a positive and safe environment for children of all ages. The wide array of program opportunities and community services, along with a dynamic center staff, make this a well utilized neighborhood resource.

Deerfield also invites you to experience our ""FREE"" Water Playground at our Spray Ground! The water runs daily from early June through mid August.

Most people begin with their neighborhood school. Sometimes that is the right fit, sometimes it isn't.

These philosophical and educational concepts involve engaging the intellectual, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of each person in a setting with younger and older students working and learning together in community. At Fort Collins Montessori School children will be given the opportunity to work in a prepared learning environment in which highly trained Montessori guides (teachers) assist each child’s academic and social development.
