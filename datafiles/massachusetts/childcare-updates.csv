Language-impaired students demonstrate deficits in the acquisition of language as well as in their ability to access the competencies they have acquired. In addition, their ability to understand the social and non-literal meaning of language is often impaired. To address these problems, LPS provides language-impaired students with specially designed instructional programs within a safe, secure and highly structured classroom setting.

LPS students are taught in small classes of students with similar functional language levels, similar compensatory needs and similar academic skills. In each class, students work on the same subject, on the same level, simultaneously. Students and teachers work cooperatively and interact throughout the entire lesson. In this way, language is constantly stimulated and structured. Teachers use multi-sensory (i.e., visual, auditory and kinesthetic) teaching modalities to reinforce learning and to accommodate a variety of learning styles.

Teachers tailor instructional materials for all subjects to the reading levels of each student group. In all classes students work on their reading, writing and communication skills while they learn the basic content of a particular subject. This fosters the development of a student's responsibility for his or her own learning. Instruction ranges along a continuum from direct and teacher-controlled to independent activities, whether the class is Reading or Career Education. The program actively engages the student in the learning process. This includes teaching students to reflect on their ability to learn, to recognize their styles of learning, to recognize success and progress and to advocate for themselves. In addition, the faculty helps students access their prior knowledge in all learning situations and guides them to generalize, integrate and transfer new content and skills in a variety of contexts.

The Center is currently divided into three age groups: Kindergartners/1st graders; 2nd/3rd graders; and 4th/5th graders. The children arrive at the Center after a relatively rigorous academic day. We provide a safe, stimulating, and home-like environment in which children will feel relaxed and happy. We believe they need a non-competitive, supportive setting with choices of activities after their school day. Many activities may be occurring simultaneously, and the low (8:1) child:staff ratio enables us to give children individualized care and attention.

The whole environment is based on experiences Practical Life, Sensorial, Language, Math, Geography, Art and Science The teacher shows a child how to perform a task, but the child then chooses to practice that task until it is completely understood. The classroom environment is specially prepared to meet the child's needs creating an atmosphere of peace and beauty, rich with meaningful and varied activities; it abounds in love, security, understanding and consistency.

To achieve that, our curriculum is built around a series of explorations that grow out of the children's authentic interests. They are playful, but far more than ""play"" – combining the power of the children's boundless curiosity with an expertly guided investigative approach that immerses the children in the process and joys of real discovery.

Research consistently supports that child-centered early education – emphasizing authentic interests rather than a rigid curriculum – leads to greater levels of information and skills acquisition, increased self-esteem and, ultimately, higher achievement. We have found this approach allows children to consistently exceed the usual educational standards, and to simultaneously develop a robust self-awareness and a joy in learning that will serve them for a lifetime.";"http://www.charlestownnurseryschool.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charlestown-Nursery-School/109387602419379";"7:45am-3pm";;"http://www.charlestownnurseryschool.org/admissions/index.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.charlestownnurseryschool.org/images/nav/logo.png";"http://www.charlestownnurseryschool.org/images/img/img_007.jpg";;;;;

Dovecrest Montessori Academy was founded in 2006. We offer programs for students in preschool, kindergarten and elementary levels (ages 2.9-10 years). As a private Montessori school, our curriculum and programs are designed to build a strong foundation in academics, as well as social, emotional, physical and moral development. This approach encourages a child’s independence, self-motivation, and decision-making skills. Our Montessori and state certified teachers receive continuing education and participate in ongoing training throughout the year. Supplemental teachers specialize in dance, music and art. Our classrooms are designed to stimulate the child’s natural curiosity to explore the world around them.


Our aim at Dovecrest is to create a place that inspires uninhibited exploration of each child's unique curiosity.  Montessori provides us with the tools to guide children through their education in a natural and joyous way.  The method allows for “Order, Self-Control and Independence”. 


We are open from 7:00 AM until 6:00 PM during the school year. The school year is from September to June, following, in general, the calendar for Brockton Public Schools with Summer program in July and August.


It gives us great satisfaction to see our children’s progress on daily basis and we invite new parents to set up a tour of our school to learn about our unique and effective program.";"http://www.dovecrest.org/";;"7:00 AM - 6:00 PM";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://imageprocessor.websimages.com/fit/1920x1920/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120202052606-music-classroom-behavior-shelvia-ivey-kids-story-top.jpg";"http://imageprocessor.websimages.com/fit/1920x1920/farm4.static.flickr.com/3452/3370498053_612bf01ac8_b.jpg";"http://imageprocessor.websimages.com/fit/1920x1920/us.cdn3.123rf.com/168nwm/iofoto/iofoto1001/iofoto100100116/6235469-teacher-helping-students-in-school-classroom-horizontally-framed-shot.jpg";"http://imageprocessor.websimages.com/fit/1920x1920/www.chestertonmontessori.com/cm_photos/cms_toddlers_large.jpg";;
656567;"East Boston Montessori School";"956 SARATOGA ST";"EAST BOSTON";"MA";2128;"SUFFOLK";6175691295;"http://ebmontessori.com/";"info@ebmontessori.com";"East Boston Montessori School is a private, independent school accepting children from 2.9 to 6 years of age. East Boston Montessori School is a member of Montessori Schools of Massachusetts, North America Montessori Teachers Association and is licensed by the Department of Early Education and Care in Massachusetts.

EBMS is a one-room schoolhouse located in the Orient Heights section of East Boston. We are located next to a public playground (Noyes Park) which provides a safe and excellent outdoor green space for our students to play. We are within walking distance from public transportation on the MBTA’s Blue Line newly renovated Orient Heights Station. Our school’s location also provides a drop off area directly in front of the school building for those driving to school.

East Boston Montessori School is a bright classroom providing an exciting environment for learning.  Our program’s philosophy begins with a deep respect for each child as a unique individual and a deep concern for each child’s social, emotional, physical and cognitive development.  We are a warm and supportive community of students, educators and parents.  Our philosophy encourages and teaches children to be kind, respectful and peaceful.

One of the distinguishing features of a Montessori program is its mixed-age grouping of children rather than a class comprised of one age level.  Our classroom comprises a group of 29 children mixed in ages from 2.9 to 6 years, where younger children learn from older children and older children reinforce their learning by teaching concepts they have already mastered.  This arrangement also mirrors the real world, where individuals work and socialize with people of all ages and dispositions.

Ideally, each child will enjoy a three-year cycle program at EBMS.  When children have the opportunity to stay with the same educator for three years, it allows educators to develop close, long-term relationships with their students, allows them to know each child’s learning style very well, and encourages a strong sense of community among the children.  With a faculty of three to four educators in the classroom there are ample opportunities for each child to receive attention, guidance and support when necessary.

Operating on the principle of freedom within limits, EBMS inspires children to work at their own pace, alone or with others.  Children are encouraged to learn through active engagement with the wide range of materials.  There is also much learning by simply watching the work and behavior of others in the classroom.  East Boston Montessori’s learning environment fosters independence for even the youngest child.  It is our goal to make children independent and be able to do things for themselves.  This is achieved by giving children opportunities to move, dress themselves, to make work/play choices and to help with adult tasks.  Thus, children have many opportunities to experience the feeling of pride and accomplishment at having completed a task on their own, contributing in self-confidence and positive self-esteem.

Interpreted through the lens of Jewish wisdom and values, the curriculum encourages community-building, collaboration and mutual respect.

This philosophy guides every aspect of the daily routine, from programming to community involvement. Consistent with the JCC Early Learning philosophy, we believe that social-emotional development is as important as cognitive development. Our team will nurture your child’s intellectual exploration and competencies—and at the same time help him or her to understand his or her emotions, label them, and express them safely and positively.

Hingham is a diverse community. We are the only local Jewish preschool, and are passionate about exposing children to the rich traditions and resources of our culture. We celebrate the fullness of living in a multicultural world while celebrating our heritage through songs, holidays and festivals, blessings, story, dance and exposure to Hebrew language. However, there are no expectations or requirements of background, belief or practice in the ELC; all are welcome at the Center.

Multicultural Afterschool Program was born in the old firehouse now home to JP Licks.  For many years, the building was occupied by a vibrant community center devoted to the arts – the JP Multicultural Arts Center, a creation of the Jamaica Plain Arts Council (which now runs JP Open Studios).  The Arts Center was also known as the “FirehouseArts Center”.   The old firehouse bustled with ballet dancers, samba drummers, photographers, jazz musicians, and….kids!   The Center was a multi-generational, open-door beehive of creativity – and it recognized that cuts in public art education mandated a grassroots after school arts program for JP’s children.

When the Center closed its doors in 1993, KidsArts! found a new home in the First Unitarian Church where it still lives to this day.  Many generations of children, staff and directors have helped build a long-standing KidsArts! community.  Scores of children have made monster masks, danced Capoeira, shot music videos, crafted shadow puppets, discussed social justice, and cooked empanadas (among other activities) – delving into deeply creative thinking that is increasingly marginalized in school.  Staff and children have developed countless personal relationships that recognize the unique creative powers of each child.  Over the years, hundreds of families have enjoyed the riches of a program that was ignited by the artists/activists of the old firehouse.";"http://jpkidsarts.org/contact-us/";;;;"http://jpkidsarts.org/registration/";;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;"https://jpkidsarts.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/firehouse-arts-center-edit1.jpg";;;;;

";"Our mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens.
  
We pursue our mission with purpose, passion, and patience.  There is neither a more basic nor more important reason for our purpose and passion to be challenged than for us to assist our members in becoming competitive in their basic skills, in their academics, in their ability to participate on the playground, and in their access to computers to overcome the ""digital divide.""  We approach the challenge with patience.
  
Founded in 1911 and chartered in 1915 by the then fledgling Boys Club of America, the Boys & Girls Club of Plymouth has served the town and its surrounding communities for over 100 years.  The Club's recent history mirrors that of the re-chartered Boys & Girls Clubs of America where ""gym and swim"" has been replaced with more academic pursuits (basic skills and homework help) - fitness and agility exercises for both the boys and girls are suited to individual and small group physical development.  The Club moved to its own new 17,000 square foot facility at 9 Resnik Road in 2003.  The Club is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization (EIN 04-2103926).
  
The Boys & Girls Club of Plymouth offers young people what they need and want most:  adults who respect and listen to them; a safe environment where they can have fun and be themselves; and interesting, constructive activities that channel youthful energy into challenging pursuits.
  
A youth development strategy underlies all Boys & Girls Club programs and fosters a sense of belonging, competence, usefulness, and upward influence in their Club that builds self-confidence and self-esteem.
  
The Boys & Girls Club of Plymouth is part of a nationwide affiliation of local, autonomous organizations and Boys & Girls Clubs of America working to help youth of all backgrounds develop the qualities needed to become responsible citizens and leaders.  It is facility-based, employs 3 full-time, 11 part-time, and 47 volunteers and offers daily access to a broad range of programs in five core program areas:  Character and Leadership Development; Education and Career Development; Health and Life Skills; The Arts; and Sports, Fitness and Recreation.
  
Today, over 800 boys and girls from all walks of life (and some at risk) are taking advantage of the programs, activities, and services provided by the Boys & Girls Club of Plymouth.  They benefit from trained, caring, professional staff and volunteers who help young people take control of their lives, envision productive futures, and reach their goals.";"http://www.bgcplymouth.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Boys-Girls-Club-of-Plymouth-MA/158343267512349";"Mon - Fri:

The Hathaway School is presently providing educational programs for students in preschool through kindergarten as well as offering extensive afterschool, summer and school vacation programs for children in grades K-6.  We offer full and part time preschool-kindergarten programs servicing children 2.9 to 5 years of age.  Our preschool and kindergarten programs are nationally accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children ( NAEYC). The programs are designed for each child to develop all the necessary skills and understandings to succeed and thrive academically.  We also provide before and after school programs as well as a summer program for K-6 school age children.  Transportation packages are also available.   
The Department of Early Education and Care (ECC) is the state agency that oversees all licensed child care in Massachusetts and has reviewed, inspected and licensed the Hathaway School for sixty preschool and sixty after school age children. Our preschool classrooms are carefully planned environments where focus is placed on the process of learning.  Each child is encouraged to create, explore, problem solve and investigate through hands-on learning experiences.  Each classroom provides various developmentally appropriate learning centers including; math and manipulatives, reading, writing, sensory science exploration, dramatic play, creative art, cooking and a block construction area.  Children have the opportunity to participate in large and small group activities in addition to individual guided play and discovery.  Each child’s opportunity to participate in developmentally appropriate activities results in success leading to the growth of self-confidence. 
The Hathaway School is a pet friendly environment.  We have a variety of animals within the school such as dogs, fish, birds and hamsters etc. Please be advised of this environment particularly if your child has allergies.
Our curriculum is standards based.  This means, in part, that we utilize the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s Curriculum Frameworks as a benchmark in developing our curriculum as well as the Early Education and Care benchmarks for development. Our curriculum always meets but generally exceeds these standards upon completion of a program.  Our students are strongly prepared to confidently meet the challenges when place in any school environment.  We believe in setting high standards for all our students. All children love to learn. It is our goal to find the way to individually address their needs so that going to school is a fun and rewarding experience.  High standards are not just for the academic arena.  We also encourage and provide students the opportunities to develop a sense of pride in themselves, in their school and within their family and community environments.  We believe that this provides the individual child the best possible opportunity to meet with success in our increasingly more globalized world.";"http://www.hathawayschool.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/hathawayschool";"Mon - Fri:

This year the school year runs from Sept. 3- June 6.  Children, between the ages of 2 years 9 months, and 5 years are welcome to attend.  The Center’s Preschool is lead by a very experienced lead teacher, Ms. Mai Pho, assisted by  an equally talented assistant teacher Ms. Heywon Lee.   The Preschool is open daily from 9:00 am – 12:00 noon.   

The Preschool classroom is large and airy with play areas for blocks, cars and trucks, a train table, a kitchen/home center, and a book corner. There is also an outdoor play space for balls, riding toys, and active games.

The Preschool curriculum is based on the Creative Curriculum model.  The teacher’s weekly lesson plans include English language development, number recognition and use, science concepts, music and rhythmic movement, arts and crafts, socialization, and large and small motor development.

The Preschool subscribes to The Weekly Reader series for this age group, and partners with Raising A Reader MA, a book-lending program.

The Asian Center’s focus is on teaching English to speakers of other languages, and this is true in the Preschool as well. Preschool families come from many countries, and for most, English is not the language they speak at home. It is our goal to prepare the children to succeed in  Kindergarten, and to that end we stress English language development. We find that children who arrive in September, often speaking no English, are communicating with each other in English by January.  Standardized testing has shown that, on average, the children gain 1+ years of English vocabulary yearly.";"http://www.asiancentermv.org/preschool-program/";;;"http://www.asiancentermv.org/employment/";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.asiancentermv.org/images/logo2.png";"http://www.asiancentermv.org/wp-content/gallery/asian-center-of-merrimack-valley/10.jpg";"http://www.asiancentermv.org/wp-content/gallery/asian-center-of-merrimack-valley/troupe.gif";"http://www.asiancentermv.org/wp-content/gallery/asian-center-of-merrimack-valley/robamhanumansovannmacha.jpg";"http://www.asiancentermv.org/wp-content/gallery/asian-center-of-merrimack-valley/robamyukon.jpg";;

Following the guidelines of the NAEYC, teachers create a curriculum that considers the age of the children, the individual child and the social and cultural context in which the children live. Children have the opportunity to work in large groups and small groups. Play and learning centers-such as block, drama, manipulatives, library, writing, art, music-enhance the curriculum and allow children ample time to play and work on social development. Routines are an important part of early childhood education and at CHDS routines give children the opportunity to work on their independence, self-help skills and self-esteem. Opportunities to interact and learn from nature are an important component of the CHDS philosophy. Ms. Helen believes that children benefit from daily interactions with nature. The process of planting tomatoes in the garden, observing the plant’s growth and then taking that first juicy bite is a hands on experience that cannot be reproduced outside the natural world. Watching a tadpole transform into a frog or a caterpillar emerge from a chrysalis show children the beauty and wonder of nature. Such interactions, when supported by caring and nurturing adults, have long lasting benefits for young children. The goal of CHDS is to develop and foster a child’s sense of wonder, to encourage his/her natural curiosity and to provide an environment that fosters each child’s social, emotional, physical and cognitive growth. Our school is staffed by professional and dedicated teachers with BA’s and MA’s in early childhood education. At CHDS, respect for the child is priority while he/she learns the concepts of sharing, fairness and respect for others. We are committed to eliminate social, religious, marital, sexual and disability discrimination.";"www.childrenshappyday.com";"https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHappyDaySchool";;;"http://childrenshappyday.com/admissions/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11025953_954880544522491_8667588232056339032_n.jpg?oh=3bda86fba0130f8cc193a0031afae0a9&oe=55BE4568&__gda__=1433871247_cd3bbc5bd8377928786f7dd422a0c782";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10639641_954867887857090_5612431773952911856_n.jpg?oh=f01b5d4ed84606851902c5fa722f71eb&oe=557292BF&__gda__=1434764290_f4f98656291535e2d12df93b3d28abf2";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10978609_943993145611231_8727502066389992761_n.jpg?oh=2cf5e6536b9cfb22a478e2cc0d28d755&oe=557495AF&__gda__=1438096914_48decafbccd9af713f5dcb75dd2198bd";"https://scontent-nrt.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10959462_943968265613719_7317698232507595152_n.jpg?oh=38900a5f8606686087e2c00903e6b5d0&oe=55B977B1";;

If you are interested in enrolling in the Barn Yard School we will send you an application form. Once your application is received for the barnyard school, you will be added to our enrollment list. We will contact you to schedule a visit. Parents applying to the school are required to visit with their child for an informal meeting and tour with the Program Director. 

Each year the number of available spaces varies for our Walpole near Norwood pre school. Families with children currently enrolled in the program are given first priority. The admission process for new families begins on December 1st for the upcoming school year. The decision to accept new families and children is based on a variety of factors and placement is at the discretion of the Executive and Program Directors.

Teacher selection, training, and curriculum planning are designed to create a warm, nurturing environment, where children are accepted for the unique individuals they are and to challenge them to develop socially, emotionally, and cognitively.

Since 1982, The Kids' Place has grown to include eight locations throughout western Massachusetts and Connecticut. Our staff is our most important resource in the success of The Kids' Place, both in the past and moving into the future. Many of our policies and practices have been a result of staff collaboration at all levels.

    Every child is unique and develops at his/her own pace.
    A safe, healthy and loving environment that fosters discovery, creativity and socialization will nurture growth and development in young children.
    Children learn by doing and it is the “process” that is important.
    Art, science, music, cooking, play and field trips are necessary for the healthy growth and development of young children.
    Children welcome the security of a daily routine.
    Flexibility is a must.
    If children learn to respect others, they will respect themselves.

656881;"Angier After School";"1697 BEACON ST";"WABAN";"MA";2468;"MIDDLESEX";6179654416;"http://www.angierafterschool.com/";"peter@angierafterschool.com";"Angier Elementary, located at 1697 Beacon Street in the Waban neighborhood of Newton, is the oldest school still in operation as part of the Newton school system. The building was designed by the Boston firm of Perry & MacNaughton, and was constructed between 1919 and 1921, the first school building built in Newton after World War I. During the War Newton experienced rapid population growth but constructed very few public buildings, and there was a pent up demand for new school facilities. Eventually fourteen new school buildings were built between 1919 and 1939 to accommodate the City of Newton’s growing population and to replace the smaller, wooden schools of the 19th Century. The Angier School replaced the earlier Roger Wolcott School on the same site. All the schools constructed in the 20s and 30s were built of brick to meet the public safety concerns of the older wood structures. Most were designed in a Colonial Revival, Georgian Revival or Tudor Revival style.

The Angier School is representative of the Tudor Revival style. The building is constructed of brick with cast stone trim around window and door openings and as bands at the cornice and below the first floor. The building has a symmetrical front (south) elevation consisting of two primary entrances flanking a one-story bowed window bay. The walls around the entrances are embellished with cast-stone-capped buttresses and crenellated parapets. The building has tall narrow window openings set in groups, which originally had multi-pane wood sashes. The school was named after First Lieutenant Albert Edgar Angier, a member of the 308th Infantry during the First World War. He died in battle near Revillon on September 14, 1918 and was awarded the Citation for Distinguished Service Cross. Albert Angier’s father, George Angier, served on the Board of Aldermen and the Newton School Committee and was the chairman of the School Committee from 1923-1924.

The firm of Perry & MacNaughton, located at 19 Congress Street, Boston, existed for only a short time in the late 1910s/early 1920s. Little information has been found about architect James H. MacNaughton. William G. Perry, however, went on to a long and distinguished career as a principal of the firm Perry, Shaw & Hepburn, which he joined in 1923. Perry is most well known for being the architect responsible for the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, the first large-scale restoration of a colonial site in the United States. The building originally contained space for a community library for the neighborhood of Waban in addition to classrooms. However, as the population of Waban expanded the school began having issues with overcrowding. In 1924 the library space was much reduced. The books were moved into the newly constructed Waban Branch Library in 1929. To address continued overcrowding a two-story addition was constructed in 1936 as part of the Public Works Administration program. The addition was designed by Frank H. Colony, Jr. a resident of Newton Centre. Colony had previously worked in the Boston offices of C. Howard Walker and Densmore & LeClear.";"http://www.angierafterschool.com/";;;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;"http://www.angierafterschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Angier-School-in-1925-Historic-Newton.jpg";"http://www.angierafterschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20131008_145934-1024x768.jpg";"http://www.angierafterschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/aaspbloppostimage.jpg";"http://www.angierafterschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/showbiz.jpg";;

We believe that it is essential to create a physical and social environment that promotes respect for all, a positive learning atmosphere and a safe place where children are valued as individuals.  Children are viewed as competent, curious and creative.   It is their genuine enthusiasm for learning about the world around them that drives our curriculum.

The daily activities at Chilmark Preschool reflect these values and visions.  The teachers have a strong knowledge of child development and recognize the value of predictability and consistency.  They are program planners, guides, careful observers and listeners.  The curriculum is not set in stone at the beginning of the year, but rather emerges from the interests and needs of the children and teachers.  In all cases our curriculum honors the Massachusetts Department of Education’s Guidelines for Preschool Learning Experiences.  These guidelines “structure learning through play and meaningful activities.”  At the beginning of the school year teachers outline the daily schedule, but the curriculum is flexible and emerges from the teachers’ careful observations of the children and their interests.

Our classroom materials invite children to investigate, make new discoveries and construct their own knowledge.  Through their natural curiosity and spontaneous play, children create opportunities to explore number concepts, build early literacy skills, understand their natural world and express themselves in a wide variety of ways.  Throughout the school day, teachers help children to express their emotions as well as understand those of their peers, fostering social relationships that are built on mutual respect and cooperation.  These meaningful and enriching experiences build a sense of confidence, competence and a love of learning.

We strive to foster parental growth and education through community events and educational opportunities and encourage and support the continued professional development of our staff. Teachers and parents work as partners to facilitate and nurture each child’s development in all areas.

Collaboration and cooperation between teachers, parents, children and the larger community is central to the success of our inclusive early childhood program.  Children will explore the island through rich experiences such as walking field trips, nature studies and community visitors.  It is important that children feel a part of their own classroom community as well as a part of the larger community.  Experiences such as these will encourage children to become enthusiastic participants in the world in which they live.";"http://www.chilmarkpreschool.com/contact/";;"Monday through Friday

Founded in 1913 the Guild's mission is to: Provide families with quality, affordable, early childhood education and school age programs in a safe, nurturing, environment for children 4 weeks to 12 years. Today, the Guild is the largest early education and care agency in Central Massachusetts, serving approximately 1,450 children in 7 child care centers, 100+ licensed family homes and 11 school age programs.   All of these services are licensed by the  MA Department of Early Education and Care and our centers are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the premier designation in the United  States for identifying high quality child care services.  

The Guild offers developmentally appropriate learning environments for your child. Our programs use Teaching Strategies GOLD, which is an assessment, reporting, and curriculum planning system. This helps us to plan meaningful activities that match your child's strengths, needs, and interests, to track his or her progress on these over time and to build a strong foundation for your child to be ready to succeed in school. The Guild is very proud to have taken a leadership role in educating our teachers. All Lead Preschool Teachers hold a bachelor's degree in Early Education or a related field. Many of our teacher assistants have associate degrees or are currently enrolled in college.

In addition to our child care programs providing children with developmentally appropriate learning environments, the Guild also offers working parents year-round services to supplement  and support the childcare. These important services are: transportation, nutritious meals, and behavioral health services and referrals.  In doing so, we serve the whole child and aid you in your role as you raise your child.

It is designed for the children to foster their creativity through play. Children learn to like themselves, and the world around them through their social interaction and play with other children. Our environment is designed to promote the social, emotional, physical, cognitive, and language development of each child. The classrooms are made of learning centers that provide hands on learning experiences, social interaction, problem solving skills, and dramatic play. Curriculum activities are centered on the individual child so that they may learn and grow comfortably at their own pace. We provide a balance of free choice, and structured activities. This enables the child to make their own choices, and build on their own ideas while developing the ability to listen and learn from directions. These structured and free choice activities focus on areas of art exploration, math, science, dramatic play, fine and gross motor exploration, and reading readiness activities.

Through the use of teacher observations, parent-teacher conferences, and student portfolios the teachers track the student’s progress throughout the year. We have an open door policy and welcome parent input and participation. We firmly believe that a strong home-school relationship is instrumental to the success of each child.

Our goal is to enable your child to grow in all areas of development to his or her fullest potential, with the love, nurturing, and guidance needed.";"www.elcmwm.org";;"Monday-Friday  7am – 6pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://elcmwm.org/dev2/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/infant-care-bellingham.jpg";"http://elcmwm.org/dev2/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/toddler-care-bellingham.jpg";"http://elcmwm.org/dev2/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/child-care-center-1.jpg";"http://elcmwm.org/dev2/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wee-folk-staff.jpg";;

After teaching three and four year olds for five years I realized that what centers lack is the feeling of home, a backyard to play in. However, today child care facilities are a necessity to assist parents. The Barn Yard fills the need parents have and provides the “back yard” that children deserve.



The Barn Yard is open 7:30-5:30, Monday – Friday. The Barn Yard serves children three months – five years. Morning drop off extends between 7:30 – 9:30 AM and there are four pick-up options for parents to choose from. 



We believe each child is a unique person with an individual personality, learning style and family background. In order to grow, children need to have a positive self-image. We have experienced that a positive self-concept empowers children to take risks. The Barn Yard supports each child in his/her explorations.



We foster the social, emotional, physical and cognitive needs of children by offering challenging play where children learn by being active participants. Child centered activities, which stimulate the child’s natural creativity and desire towards mastery, promote active learning where the children are encouraged to make choices, validating them as important people. The Barn Yard provides a safe, secure and developmentally appropriate environment, which allows each child to express his/her natural curiosity about themselves and the world around them.



We perceive parents as being the most significant adults in a child’s life. We strive to create a mutual respect between parents and teachers; a partnership for the benefit of your child. When parents and teachers collaborate to provide loving, consistent boundaries children have the support needed to develop a feeling of security, success and self-confidence.



The Barn Yard provides an atmosphere that supports the growth of the whole child – the social, emotional, physical and intellectual child. We offer a child-initiated curriculum with age appropriate challenges and objectives for children three months to five years. With praise and encouragement, and safety assured, we promote active learning, allowing the children to make their own choices. Child centered activities allow children to free play, helping them to internalize and understand the world around them.";"http://www.barnyardchildcare.com/Contact-Us.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Barn-Yard-Child-Care-Center/251044558272217";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.barnyardchildcare.com/Photos_-_15.jpg";"http://www.barnyardchildcare.com/Photos_-_17.jpg";"http://www.barnyardchildcare.com/Photos_-_11.jpg";"http://www.barnyardchildcare.com/Photos_-_01.jpg";;

Young children are inherently egocentric and scientific; and deserving of quality life experiences that will enable them to safely self-discover and explore their giant, complicated world.

Every intricate building begins with a strong, secure foundation; then is constructed within a safe environment, protected by a strong support system called scaffolding. When the construction process is complete, the scaffolding is peeled away; revealing a freestanding skyscraper. Harmony supports a positive child guidance process whereby very young children are given the opportunity to develop a strong foundation or support system by parents, teachers, and community; who then work together creating the scaffolding or safe nurturing environment within which a child can safely grow into a self-contained, independent adult.

Prior to opening the center Bonnie Morrison operated a Daycare out of her Rochester home from August 01- July 05. Bonnie has a genuine love and care for children. She develops a unique bond with each child that you will see the minute you walk through the door.

The staff at Countryside takes a lot of pride in the role they play in your child’s life. Countryside has a team of dedicated teachers that thrive in teaching children independence, gaining self-confidence, and all the fundamentals of learning to ensure school readiness.

Our spacious classrooms and playground allow children to explore their surroundings with lots of hands on activities and learning tools in a safe and nurturing environment. Teachers plan and implement age appropriate activities that encourage children to learn, play and explore. Children and teachers have one on one interactions together along with monitored group play where the children learn from teachers as well as their peers.

The staff at Countryside builds strong relationships with the children and their families to form a bridge between home and child care.

Because we believe in the tremendous potential of all children to excel, we recognize them as scholars.

For us, it's all about ensuring children have the time they need fulfill that potential in school and in life.  Research shows that a lack of learning opportunities outside of school – and in particular, a lack of summer learning opportunities – causes up to 2/3 of the academic achievement gap between children from low-income communities and their higher-income peers.  We aim to change that by helping schools and communities find innovative ways to expand learning time beyond the traditional school day and school year.  By bringing the classroom into the community, and the community into the classroom, we aim to redefine how, where, and when learning occurs.

Our two main program models, BELL Summer and BELL After School, are based on strong partnerships with schools and deliver small-group academic instruction, mentorship, a wide range of enrichment activities, and community engagement.  In BELL programs, scholars experience success, gain self-confidence, and become more prepared to succeed in the classroom.  Our models also help parents become more engaged in their child's education.  Scholar success and parent engagement leads to improved school attendance, higher grades and test scores, and increased graduation rates.

Our programs serve scholars in grades K-8 throughout the United States.

We are a national organization, born in Boston.  We have been perfecting our approach to expanding learning time since 1992.

These areas of development are integrated into the curriculum through developmentally appropriate practice. That is, teachers provide activities appropriate for the age and leaning differences with each group. We are guided in determining appropriate developmental practice by the position statement of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and Guidelines for Preschool Learning Experiences.

Given recent technological advances and best practices, I continue to see the face of education evolve.

The Children’s Center for Communication (CCC), more broadly defines our services to children, families, and the community. This organizational expansion distinguished the broad array of services and supports we offer. Our students may come to us with a diagnosis of Autism, Cerebral Palsy, developmental or physical challenges. Our students may have the commonality of a learning or communication disabilities – but he/she is seen as an individual learner, each with their own strengths and contributions.

Beverly School for the Deaf (BSD) continues to remain a strong academic and language-rich program open to all children, from preschool to high school, with any degree of hearing loss. Our students on campus and in the community are diverse and have individual needs. These needs are supported by various approaches and accommodations including: ASL, oral language, cochlear implants, FM systems, hearing aids, lip-reading, and additional systems, which assist with learning and development. We continue to focus on developing Deaf/HH children to become well rounded academically, socially, vocationally, and in all aspects of their communication and life.

CCCBSD parents entrust us with their child’s development during the most important period of his or her life.

It opened with a single classroom for 15 children, ages 3-5 years, and was housed in the basement of an historic church that is now the Jewish Community of Amherst.

 In 1977, AMS moved to rented space at South Congregational Church on South East Street in Amherst. In 1981, in response to demand from the community, it added a second classroom at this location. Programs grew to be full school day (8 AM-3 PM), with before- and after-care options for working families.

In 1984, with the guidance and support of many families and local businesspeople, Amherst Montessori School purchased 2.2 acres at 27 Pomeroy Lane in South Amherst and constructed its first permanent home, a 3,000 square foot facility housing two classrooms for children ages 3-5 (Children’s Houses). The school opened its doors at this location in September 1986. From 1986-1995, the school was located entirely at this location.  In 1995, it leased additional space at South Congregational Church, then St. Brigid’s Church, and added a third Children’s House (ages 3-5 years) and an Elementary Program. It added a Toddler Program in 1998, and then moved all annexed programs to Immanuel Lutheran Church in 1999.

PeaceDayCelebrationIn September 2004, Amherst Montessori School left the annex location at Immanuel Lutheran Church, and leased space at 7 Pomeroy Lane, two lots away from its Main Campus at 27 Pomeroy Lane. It relocated its Elementary Program to this leased space, and consolidated its Children’s Houses from three classrooms to two (one of which moved into 7 Pomeroy Lane). The Toddler Program was moved into a classroom at 27 Pomeroy Lane.";"http://www.amherstmontessori.org/";;"8 AM-3 PM";"http://www.amherstmontessori.org/about-ams/employment";"http://www.amherstmontessori.org/admission/how-to-apply";"http://www.amherstmontessori.org/community/parents-handbook";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.amherstmontessori.org/templates/amsresponsive/images/amherst-montessori-school.png";;;;;;

The South Easton center accommodates 100 children ages 6 weeks to 8 years of age. The center consists of 8 classrooms all equipped with Internet viewing access, and a large indoor play area displaying 3 giant playhouses as well as 2 fenced playground areas. The building is bright with pastel colored doors, skylights and pitched ceilings. Programs are available for Infants, Toddlers, Preschool and Kindergarten. There is a choice of full time or part time schedules to meet the needs of all parents. Our Raynham location is similar in many ways but has 9 classrooms and is licensed for 111 children.

 

In a supportive and safe environment, where your child feels welcome and successful, our experienced, caring, and certified Early Education and Care Teachers guide children in developing their social, emotional, cognitive and physical skills. We provide your child with a natural, nurturing and stimulating setting that allows for learning, exploration, social interactions and lots of play.

 

Because children learn differently than adults, they need hands-on experiences and well trained teachers to provide warmth, enthusiasm and encouragement. Most of all, they need the joy and challenge of doing different things themselves. That's what helps children learn, grow and thrive and this is what we offer each any every child at one of our centers.

";"We opened our first center in 2004 because we saw a need in the community, and were eager to fill it. We wanted to create a welcoming environment for working families in South Dartmouth, where parents felt confident their kids were well cared for, safe, comfortable, and of course, HAPPY!  We were so fortunate that local families immediately responded, and seemed to love the care we provided for their children. As our enrollment steadily grew, we felt a strong need to provide additional programming for older children in our care before and after their school day. Our small center was ideal for little ones, but we were limited in what we could offer to the bigger kids.  As a result, we opened Kids Ink Too in September 2008. Kids Ink Too has so much to offer both our school age students and our many preschoolers. We are proud to serve the families of Dartmouth and greater New Bedford, and will continue to be active in the community, always interested in continuing to meet the needs of the working families that make this area so great! Our commitment to each Kids Ink family is to make the most of your child’s formative years, as the most active period in cognitive development is from infancy to age 5. We strive to make Kids Ink a home away from home: a place where a child wants to be – every day – where the focus is on developing a strong learning foundation. For parents who want to bring out the best in their children and provide long-term advantages at a very early age, Kids Ink is the place to be.

I hope that your child's years with us are fun, nurturing and happy. The staff and I are anxiously awaiting your child's arrival. We are committed to providing a rich and caring environment where children can feel confident about themselves and their ability to succeed. We want you to know that your child's daycare is your daycare and we expect you to stop by, talk with the staff, ask questions, and share your ideas and talents with us.

Your child's day will be filled with many varied and exciting activities. Our teachers carefully prepare the classroom environment with many interests to stimulate self-motivated learning. Children are encouraged to grow and progress at their own pace by choosing from a variety of interesting and fun activities. At our daycare you will see happy faces, full of wonder, ideas, and things to talk about, relate to, compare, match, fit into, try out, reinvent, discover, and enjoy.

The program we pursue is geared toward helping children develop habits of observation, questioning, and listening. It gives them awareness of their own feelings, and their right to express those feelings by sometimes channeling in to other means of expression. They learn they are free to make choices. A program like ours gives your child the necessary guidance and nurturing he/she needs to become self confident, independent, and most of all happy!

Our school strives to meet these needs by offering a developmentally appropriate, bi-cultural curriculum which provides a warm and supportive foundation in Jewish and American cultural experiences. Under no circumstances is a child discriminated against because of race, creed, national origin, disability or parent's marital status or sexual orientation.

Our program is based on the needs of the individual child. We believe that children learn best through play and experimentation. Therefore, we provide a variety of experiences through which the children develop new skills and build self-confidence as they grow and mature.

It allows them the time they need developmentally, to explore their environment and make sense of what they are learning. It is not a quiet time, nor is it a noisy time, but a time when they can use their voices to communicate with friends, show excitement, or ask questions. It is an opportunity for them to move around their classroom and manipulate various objects.
Center time is usually about 45 minutes in the morning and 1 hour in the afternoon. Children choose what center they would like by moving their nametag on the center choice board. Each center has a set number of children that can play there at a time. This is to ensure that not too many children are in one center at a time. Children understand that when they choose a center they are responsible to play there for “awhile” and cleanup what they used before they leave. Children are encouraged to use various centers and make the most of their center time experience.";"http://www.discoverydaycarecenter.com/";;"Monday - Friday 6:30am to 6:00pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.discoverydaycarecenter.com/image/97071718_scaled_223x138.jpg";"http://www.discoverydaycarecenter.com/image/98372918_scaled_710x209.jpg";"http://www.discoverydaycarecenter.com/image/98309164_scaled_309x177.jpg";"http://www.discoverydaycarecenter.com/image/97071702_scaled_192x144.jpg";"http://www.discoverydaycarecenter.com/image/97493891_scaled_191x127.jpg";;

We do this by having consistent and qualified staff members to work in our programs. Many of the staff have 15 to 20 years experience working at Wareham Child Care. Staff members have Master's Degrees in early childhood education, Bachelor's Degrees in education or related fields and some of our teachers have Associate's Degrees in early education. Wareham Child Care is accredited by the National Association of the Education of Young Children.

Wareham Child Care is an award winning early education and child care program. The purpose of our agency is to provide the best possible care (Wareham Child Care was voted BEST CHILD CARE in 2003, 2004, & 2005)for the families we serve. We make an earnest effort to secure funding to use as subsidies or scholarships to families who can not afford the full cost of early education and care. Wareham Child Care receives funding from the new Department of Early Education and Care, the United Way of Greater New Bedford, Wareham's Tobey Will Foundation, and the Community Partnerships for Children. Wareham Child Care receives funding form the U.S.D.A to provide breakfast, lunch and 2 snacks daily.

Wareham Child Care was created in 1980 with Housing and Urban Development Block Grant funds. The purpose of this grant was to provide assistance to day care centers catering to low income families. The program was especially aimed at welfare reliant mothers who were unable to work because of dependent children. Since 1983, Wareham Child Care has been awarded contracts with the State to provide subsidized child care services to eligible families in the Wareham area.

She identified, through years of observation of young children, characteristics of learning common to all children. She believed all children carry within themselves the person they will become. In order to fully develop, a child must have freedom. This is a freedom to choose activities of interest. It is not a freedom to do nothing. Through the interaction with the activities in the classroom, order and self-discipline will develop.

Dr. Montessori developed what is called “the prepared environment.” This is an ordered environment where furniture is child sized and every activity has its own place in its own space. Children learn at their own abilities and interests and in a non-competitive atmosphere of love and respect. Grace and courtesy help the child learn the rules governing social behavior (i.e. how to greet someone, how to watch a lesson and how to courteously interrupt others speaking).

The role of the teacher is to prepare the environment, present the activities to the child and to motivate the child to interact with the activities in the classroom. It is the child who learns to choose activities of interest. It is the acquisition of inner discipline that allows children to complete activities and move on to choose another work.

Montessori education teaches children to observe, reason and problem solve. It allows children to experience the joy of discovery and develop a love for independent learning.";"http://www.cfmontessori.com/";;"8:30 am - 3 pm";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.cfmontessori.com/pics/logo-2005_3.gif";"http://www.cfmontessori.com/pics/about_us/school.gif";"http://www.cfmontessori.com/pics/about_us/schoolyard.jpg";"http://www.cfmontessori.com/pics/kindergarten/readinggroup.jpg";;;

Our interest is in creating a comfortable space where people are welcomed and valued without being reduced to food, clothing, music, etc. As important as these things are to cultures, we know that people are so much more. After all, we are people too and know there is more based on our own experiences. We want to plant the seeds of good critical thinking and conflict resolution skills in natural, kid friendly settings. We plant the seeds during discussion times and offer room to practice during the students’ activity choice times. For example, we have noticed that past students seem more open to difference during formal discussions than they practice out on the playground. The comments they let slip about who “throws like a girl” or what’s “so gay” offer us opportunities to ask “What do you mean?” or “Why is that an insult?” It’s not about pushing a “We don’t say that” propaganda but about finding our assumptions, questioning our assumptions, and considering some revisions that might improve our interactive experiences.

For over sixty years, the needs and rights of our children and the desire to work together have brought families to Community Nursery School.

At CNS, children are seen as unique individuals who come together to share and explore their world through interaction with a wide range of materials. Together they learn to respect and appreciate both their similarities and their differences.  As individuals, they are encouraged to build upon their existing knowledge and grow in the way that is most comfortable to them.

Our mission at CNS is to foster social, emotional, physical, and intellectual growth within the context of a nurturing and engaging atmosphere. Our work is guided by the following principles and goals:

    Helping children feel sure of themselves and comfortable with others.
    Making this confidence the base from which they explore the world around them.
    Fostering learning by creating a rich and engaging classroom environment.
    Considering the transition from home to school as a time of joy, growth and learning.

CNS provides opportunities that support the developmental needs and rights of all children served. CNS offers:

    A stimulating and enriching environment where children are encouraged to explore, experiment and make investigations that support all areas of learning and development.
    Teachers who see children as competent and capable of constructing knowledge as they provide provocations, encouragement and support.

Each child has his or her own unique personality, learning style, developmental pace and family background. The Barnyard School of Mansfield will respectfully provide educationally appropriate and creative experiences which are responsive to different learning styles. We foster challenging play which actively involves the child, enabling them to learn by doing. Children are encouraged to make choices, therefore allowing each to gain a feeling of empowerment. What the child experiences in child care will exert a profound effect on how he or she grows physically, socially, emotionally and intellectually as these are the formative years.

Despite the high quality of our center, we emphasize that the primary responsibility for the child lies with the parent. The center does not replace the parent nor should it be thought of as a babysitting service. It is simply a combined effort of concerned adults to provide as healthy, safe and stimulating an atmosphere as possible, regarding the children placed in their care. We strive for open and respectful communication as well as involvement among parents, family members, and teaching staff.

    The Barnyard School of Mansfield respects each family regardless of race, religion, cultural heritage, political beliefs, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation or disablity.

With this philosophy in mind, we welcome you to the Barnyard School of Mansfield.";"http://www.barnyardschoolofmansfield.com/";;"7am-6pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.barnyardschoolofmansfield.com/images/Barnyard_School.gif";"http://www.barnyardschoolofmansfield.com/gallery.php?id=100_0142.JPG";;;;;

Founded in 1913 the Guild's mission is to: Provide families with quality, affordable, early childhood education and school age programs in a safe, nurturing, environment for children 4 weeks to 12 years. Today, the Guild is the largest early education and care agency in Central Massachusetts, serving approximately 1,450 children in 7 child care centers, 100+ licensed family homes and 11 school age programs.   All of these services are licensed by the  MA Department of Early Education and Care and our centers are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the premier designation in the United  States for identifying high quality child care services.  

The Guild offers developmentally appropriate learning environments for your child. Our programs use Teaching Strategies GOLD, which is an assessment, reporting, and curriculum planning system. This helps us to plan meaningful activities that match your child's strengths, needs, and interests, to track his or her progress on these over time and to build a strong foundation for your child to be ready to succeed in school. The Guild is very proud to have taken a leadership role in educating our teachers. All Lead Preschool Teachers hold a bachelor's degree in Early Education or a related field. Many of our teacher assistants have associate degrees or are currently enrolled in college.

In addition to our child care programs providing children with developmentally appropriate learning environments, the Guild also offers working parents year-round services to supplement  and support the childcare. These important services are: transportation, nutritious meals, and behavioral health services and referrals.  In doing so, we serve the whole child and aid you in your role as you raise your child.

CCC has earned a reputation within the community as a premier child care center. Parent satisfaction is reflected in the high sibling enrollment and the extensive wait list.

The administrators determine CCC policy with guidance from an Advisory Board of Directors. An administrative staff, including two directors, and a professional teaching staff, directs CCC's daily operation.

Licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (EEC), under the auspices of the Needham Board of Health, Carter Center for Children, Inc. (CCC), operates as a private, non profit children's center, five full days a week all year long. CCC provides quality child care in a safe, healthy environment for families living in the Needham area, aids children and supports parents in optimum development of each child's social, emotional, physical and cognitive skills, and helps bring meaning and understanding to the young child's world.

CCC offers a well-balanced approach to early childhood education, striving to create a non-competitive environment. Children are provided with a wide variety of developmental materials, including access to an extensive children's library and two areas of outdoor play equipment and space. An experienced, caring staff, trained in early childhood education, provide support and have considerable resources to share with families in an understanding and non-judgmental environment.

Parents have peace of mind at CCC that their child is cared for in a responsive, safe, environment where children can learn through play and where emphasis is placed on being a family-oriented center. Our goal is to concentrate on the growth of the whole child; our schedule reflects the needs of working parents; and, our policies attempt to address parent concerns whenever possible.";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/contact.html";;"7:30AM - 6:00PM Monday through Friday";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/careers.html";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/admissions_enrollment.html";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/policies.html";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/images/carter081707.jpg";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/images/photos/donna_guitar2.jpg";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/images/photos/jesse.jpg";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/images/photos/stars_dressup.jpg";"http://www.cartercenterforchildren.org/images/photos/alphabet.jpg";;

For nearly a century, Gladys Allen Brigham Community Center has provided guidance, support, and advocacy for girls and their families. As one of Berkshire County’s largest social service organizations, the Brigham Center has touched countless lives through its wide range of programs and services.

The Brigham Center had its beginning on Bank Row in 1911 as the Young Women’s Home Association, with 37 girls in its first days. It re-located to East Street in 1924. Facilities were expanded, first with a gymnasium and tennis court. In 1929, Camp Witawentin became the first resident camp for area girls, later joined by Camp Stevenson, the day camp.

With General Electric providing the lead gift, the present building was opened in 1958, with the attached swimming pool. The Brigham Center continued to provide strong home economics & sports opportunities for girls, learning that girls needed new skills for long-term economic security. Adding value to community and market meant stronger, smarter & bolder supports, training and education.

During the 1970s, the Brigham Center responded to changing community needs by implementing counseling and childcare programs, programs for single and teen parents, & other social services. In the last decade, the Brigham Center has expanded to develop athletics and more programs for adolescent girls. The gymnasium & swimming pool were restored.

The director, Mira Fayngersh, grew up in a family of educators. Mira's mother was a life-long math teacher and her father was a school principal. Although Mira graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering, she quickly realized that her true calling was teaching. She began working as a teacher at a local preschool, where her son was attending a toddler group. Mira continued her education while working her way up to take charge of the entire school of over 200 kids.

In 1988 Mira left the Soviet Union. After stepping off the plane in Boston, she started working at a home daycare in Brookline the very next day. One year later, Happy Child Daycare & Preschool welcomed its first child. Without any advertising, the school's popularity was growing by word of mouth. In a few short years, the original school of 18 children has grown to the almost 80 precious minds we have today.

From the moment you walk through the doors, you sense that this place is very special. From Lilya (the school cook who's been with us for over 15 years), who prepares warm daily meals; to the warm smiles of teachers and happy voices of children in the classrooms, you can feel the atmosphere of the school right away! Children enjoy countless trips to the petting zoo, apple picking, sprinkler parks, recreational parks, movies and hay rides, and of course the famous Halloween parade; it seems the school has and does it all! Happy Child engages children in numerous classes such as: karate, soccer, creative movement and music. Then, in the summer, there are the wadding pools and the sprinklers, kids' absolute favorite. Every year we hold a Thanksgiving Potluck dinner, an Art Gallery, and Welcome Back to School party.

Founded in 1986, the school provides the children of The Blackstone Valley with a high quality preschool and kindergarten education. Country Montessori is dedicated to providing students with a nurturing learning environment where they feel safe and secure in an intellectually and socially stimulating environment. Country Montessori is a special place to learn, laugh, explore and grow. Enrollment is open to children between the ages of two years and nine-months to seven years-old.

The school’s purpose is to develop the whole child, physically, intellectually and socially. Dr. Montessori through scientific study and observation concluded that children are natural learners who absorb from the environment around them. Country Montessori is dedicated to providing children with an environment that will cultivate the child’s natural desire to learn, to instill in each child a love of learning, and to build the foundation for success in future years.

Country Montessori’s curriculum integrates the core knowledge areas of language arts, social studies, mathematics, music and singing, art and creative crafts, computer learning, enrichment programs and physical education and social skill development. Our qualified teachers respect every child and nurture their desire to learn.

We offer half and full day preschool and kindergarten programs. Extended hours from 7:15 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. are available year-round. We are proud to offer a preschool environment with extended hours recognizing the need for a quality preschool and kindergarten program for working parents.

 Children have an innate curiosity, and if we can channel that – truly capture their sense of wonder we will strike gold.

Small groups lead to BIG results!
Growing Places embeds in its philosophy the unique concept of sub-grouping our already
small class sizes. Each child gets more direct access to the teacher, and the teacher gets
a greater opportunity to truly observe how that child learns.
Most importantly, small groups give us the opportunity to embrace who each child is
individually and help make each child feel valued, unique and part of a larger community.";"www.growingplacespreschool.com";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://growingplacespreschool.org/images/gp%20header.jpg";"http://growingplacespreschool.org/images/maxmika-u937.jpg";"http://growingplacespreschool.org/images/prek-literacy-012.jpg";"http://growingplacespreschool.org/images/olivia-u939.jpg";"http://growingplacespreschool.org/images/img_4783-u1045.jpg";;

Our program was developed for school-aged children in grades K-6 and our staff is committed to providing them with a nurturing, constructive and happy environment. Enrolling your child in this program will prevent immature decision-making and also prevent behaviors that can occur when children go home to an empty house.

 

Children are our number one priority and are the reason we strive to meet all of their educational, physical and emotional needs. Our staff greets all students daily and ensures that each child is made to feel as an important part of the group. Children are given individual attention whenever possible, which we feel, is so crucial before and after a busy school day. Safety is a big concern and our goal is to improve socialization skills while building children’s self-esteem.

We encourage and guide children to become independent thinkers and offer a wide variety of small and large group activities to support child development. We offer homework assistance to students so families do not have to focus most of their quality time on school assignments in the evening. We also provide children with free time so that they can unwind at the end of their structured school day.

 The program will communicate with families frequently by the use of daily contact at arrival and dismissal times, phone calls when appropriate, and newsletters. If at any time you have a question, concern, or suggestion you are encouraged to share them with the staff.

We are one of the oldest preschools on Martha’s Vineyard, begun in 1969 as a free school in the town of Gay Head. Eight children were enrolled that year. There was no tuition, and no salary was paid to the teachers. Although the school has been refined quite a bit from those early years, threads of the original philosophy, particularly an emphasis on creative arts, are still a part of our curriculum.

In 1993, Island Children’s School realized a longstanding dream. Under the guidance of long-time director Elaine Allen, and thanks to the efforts of many people, the program was moved to our own building located at 5 Halcyon Way, next to the West Tisbury School. In 2006, we completed the first stage of renovation/expansion inside the building.  In 2012, we completed the second stage of renovation with an massive upgrade to the playground.

a rolling basis throughout the year. Drop in care is available once approved
by the Kid's Club office.
***Drop in care can not be an option on delayed openings because of
staffing ratios or unless approved by the Kid's Club office.
Before School is a quiet, relaxed time to enjoy:
• time with friends & teachers
• planned curriculum guided by teachers
• open exploration & play which includes:  art, building, reading, games, gym time & outdoor time
The children may bring breakfast if they wish.  At some schools, breakfast is available for a fee.  At approximately 8:20am, children may join friends on the playground as they arrive for school.
The overall philosophy, both Before School and After School, is to help children become independent, self-reliant, resourceful, capable of reasoning and thinking, able to problem solve and make good choices.  Kid's Club is a place to learn social skills, conflict resolution and problem solving; to be ready for the challenges that face them as they confront life's issues.

""Kid's Club After School is located at 65 Phillips St. The main childcare rooms are developmental in design, allowing children to make decisions within defined limits. The classrooms include the following areas: reading and group time, computer and homework, art, sensory, sand and water, science and writing, manipulative, games, blocks or construction and dramatic play. Activities outside of these areas are also offered, such as cooking, sports, music, movement, and carpentry. Programming allows for free play, homework choice, quiet time, snack and outdoor play.

The program follows the Andover Public School calendar. Kid's Club is closed during the summer (but has a summer program), most holidays and December vacation week. It is open during February and April school vacation weeks, based on the needs of the current user group. It will remain open on snow days (depending on the severity of the storm) and in-service days.

The Kid's Club program has 200 slots. Actual enrollment is based on the distribution of slots throughout the week. Group size varies depending on the activity; ratios are maintained at approximately 10:1. The staff reflects a diversity of training and experience in early childhood education and childcare. Staff development and training opportunities are offered throughout the year.

The teaching staff offers conference time (at parents request) for a more thorough discussion of a child's progress. Written progress reports will be maintained in each child's record and are available for parental review with a staff member. This communication between parents and teachers is essential in creating a program that not only meets parents' needs, but also provides an enriching and comfortable environment for the children.""

At Apple Seeds, we recognize the uniquenesses of the ""whole child,"" and build upon their strengths and weaknesses socially, emotionally, physically, and cognitively. We accomplish this through our interactive program using a hands-on approach through thematic learning centers and related projects. Our well-planned program encourages children to learn about the world around them through exploration, discovery, and imagination. We employ teacher-directed learning centers, coupled with cooperative and independent learning centers, for maximum learning for your child. Our projects created in class have a specific purpose and are related to either a story we have read in class or connected to our thematic unit.

In addition to projects and learning centers, Apple Seeds also believes in the importance and power of learning through play. Play is necessary for the maturation of all areas of learning and development. Through play, children develop interpersonal relationships, the ability to work cooperatively, and the ability to solve conflicts. It also improves hand-eye coordination and both small and large muscle development. Children learn to express their feelings, to cope, to be creative, and to enjoy learning. Children also develop the various cognitive processes such as predicting, classifying, and observing, and learn new concepts. It has been well documented that play is necessary in the development of language, which promotes future successes in reading and writing, which is why we consider it an important learning tool in our program.

At Apple Seeds, we pride ourselves on providing quality Education, Knowledge, Experience and a Shared Philosophy that parents are their children's first teacher and together we form a partnership to build the foundation of their lifelong education.

657583;"Dartmouth Early Learning Center";"284 GULF RD";"South Dartmouth";"MA";2748;"Bristol";5089921301;"http://www.delc.us/";"michael@delc.us";"The mission of DELC is to support the essential nurturing and guidance that is critical to healthy growth and development of young children by offering a rich home-familiar learning environment where children's curiosity and hunger for learning are promoted through play, discovery and the arts. Our programs are designed to help children build positive self-images, develop competence and positive dispositions toward learning and school, and to learn basic skills of social living. The work we do at DELC is intimately related in aim, in method, and in materials used to fundamental assumptions about how, what, and why children learn. Our constructivist approach is child centered, hands-on and humanistic and is aimed at the harmonious development of the whole child in all areas. It is meant to reflect a variety of developmental levels among children taking into account their many individual characteristics and special qualities. Our emphasis is on helping children discover and work towards their own style of learning, construct meanings, and use freedom in a carefully prepared environment.

Our philosophy of education has developed over the twenty years that we have been teaching young children. While we have integrated the ideas of many fine educators, we have been most inspired by the Reggio Emilia preschools in Italy whose aim is to ""preserve the spell of the child unbroken."" The basic components of Reggio Emilia include viewing the child as powerful rather than powerless; using an emergent curriculum that is based on the interests of children; engaging in projects that are not limited in time or scope; and documenting the child's progress with words and pictures.

While we design developmentally appropriate readiness activities for our children to explore, we recognize the educational value of children finding and solving self-defined problems that arise from child-initiated activity and choices. Through shared activity and social exchange children co-construct their knowledge of the world using one child's ideas to develop anothers or to explore a path yet unexplored. The teacher does not direct children's learning in lock step fashion, rather facilitates it through the selection of stimulating materials, the arrangement of the environment, and our day to day interactions with children. Our role as teachers is to set the stage for learning, to offer encouragement, and to gently guide the learning and development of the children in our care. We feel that what really matters in early childhood education is the spirit of the young child that needs to be nurtured, the reason he/she learns so well. As children become increasingly institutionalized, it helps to keep in mind that what happens to this spirit has far more consequences than any specific content in schooling. A program with this kind of focus sets the stage for positive attitudes about one's
self, about school, and learning is likely to produce children who feel that learning is enjoyable, meaningful, and rewarding.

It is our firm belief and guiding philosophy that children learn best through play, and that play is their very significant form of work. Play puts learning in a context and gives it a purpose. Through play children are given a chance to try out options, to make meaningful personal choices, to explore solutions to problems, and practice new skills without getting bored. Children need to play in an environment rich in resources, to explore, to test, and to learn from feedback on their own actions. We recognize the intrinsic worth of play and provide ample opportunity, time, and materials for this purpose.

Our schedule has a built in, yet flexible structure that alternates between periods of free play, small group activities and special projects, circle time, snack, story, music, movement, and outdoor play. We strive to create a balance between active and quiet times, and between self-selected and teacher-directed activities. Children are encouraged to express their feelings, to develop powers of concentration, to use their imaginations, to try new ideas, to develop a sense of independence and responsibility for one's decisions, and to accommodate other children's viewpoints.

In all of the children's daily activities emphasis is placed more on process rather than production. Teachers acting as partners rather than as sole imparters of knowledge, help children develop self esteem and visual awareness as well as strong social, problem-solving and communication skills. As fellow investigators, they help children explore and experiment in depth, and express their ideas not just in words, but in many visual forms that may be more understandable to them, such as drawing, painting, construction, and creative dramatics.

These goals are best achieved in an educational setting that offers security as
well as challenge. We strive to create a sense of community by supporting the
bond between parent and child by including parents in program planning, by
inviting parents to participate in as many activities as their schedules allow, by encouraging parents to participate as classroom volunteers, and by sharing our special knowledge of children in frequent and supportive conferences and group discussions. In addition to expanding our program offerings, such cooperative efforts by staff and parents enriches our center and reinforces a sense of community and an enriched family life.";"http://www.delc.us/";;"7:30 am -

A second site was added in 1989 at the First Parish Church on Main Street in Bolton. Both locations have grown into well-established community preschools and continue to serve families from Stow, Bolton, and the surrounding communities. Children's Horizons' primary goal is to provide a developmentally stimulating and caring environment for all children. We realize each child is an individual with his/her own interests, skills and values. We assist children in developing their interests and by recognizing their personal learning styles. We coordinate our programs with the area schools in preparation for future learning. We offer a program that enables children to learn as they play. We promote both child-initiated and teacher-directed activities to cultivate imagination and creativity. We believe the process of a child's work is always more important than the finished product. We help foster a love of learning and encourage students through developmentally appropriate activities and lessons. Each child learns at his/her own pace and due to our low student-teacher ratio (1:6) we are able to offer individual attention to each child. We incorporate all areas of child development in our curriculum through English language arts, math, science and technology/engineering, history, social science, the arts and health education. We offer individual, small group and large group activities.

We encourage this learning through a variety of means such as cooking, planting, creating, dancing, singing, storytelling and sensory activities such as sand and water exploration. In addition, readiness skills will be incorporated into our curriculum: colors, shapes and patterns, number and letter recognition, and science concepts. Ample time is allowed for the development of fine and gross motor skills through the use of manipulative, indoor/outdoor gym equipment and group games.
     Language development is emphasized in our curriculum. Through art, music, early literacy and other age appropriate activities your child will be given many opportunities to use expressive language and devlop good listening skills.
     We feel that an exposure to a wide variety of experiences and ample time for imaginative play, your child will develop an eagerness for learning.

Founded in 1913 the Guild's mission is to: Provide families with quality, affordable, early childhood education and school age programs in a safe, nurturing, environment for children 4 weeks to 12 years. Today, the Guild is the largest early education and care agency in Central Massachusetts, serving approximately 1,450 children in 7 child care centers, 100+ licensed family homes and 11 school age programs.   All of these services are licensed by the  MA Department of Early Education and Care and our centers are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the premier designation in the United  States for identifying high quality child care services.  

The Guild offers developmentally appropriate learning environments for your child. Our programs use Teaching Strategies GOLD, which is an assessment, reporting, and curriculum planning system. This helps us to plan meaningful activities that match your child's strengths, needs, and interests, to track his or her progress on these over time and to build a strong foundation for your child to be ready to succeed in school. The Guild is very proud to have taken a leadership role in educating our teachers. All Lead Preschool Teachers hold a bachelor's degree in Early Education or a related field. Many of our teacher assistants have associate degrees or are currently enrolled in college.

In addition to our child care programs providing children with developmentally appropriate learning environments, the Guild also offers working parents year-round services to supplement  and support the childcare. These important services are: transportation, nutritious meals, and behavioral health services and referrals.  In doing so, we serve the whole child and aid you in your role as you raise your child.

I designed and opened the first Kalia Care Daycare Center in Lakeville, Massachusetts in 1997 after researching childcare for my young daughter. Unfortunately, what I discovered was unsuitable for our needs. I became inspired to develop and build a center that the community would be proud of, while filling a tremendous need for quality childcare in the South Shore area. Kalia Care Daycare Center is a family-owned business that provides the highest standard in quality childcare and educational experience.

As our community’s demand for our services increased, so did the desire to continue our Early Childcare philosophy. We opened additional schools; Kalia Care in 1999, Kalia Kids in 2002 and Kalia 4.0 in 2009. Our growth and success is due in part to our continued passion and commitment to provide nurturing teachers, a rich curriculum and a close working partnership with our parents.

Founded in 1913 the Guild's mission is to: Provide families with quality, affordable, early childhood education and school age programs in a safe, nurturing, environment for children 4 weeks to 12 years. Today, the Guild is the largest early education and care agency in Central Massachusetts, serving approximately 1,450 children in 7 child care centers, 100+ licensed family homes and 11 school age programs.   All of these services are licensed by the  MA Department of Early Education and Care and our centers are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the premier designation in the United  States for identifying high quality child care services.  

The Guild offers developmentally appropriate learning environments for your child. Our programs use Teaching Strategies GOLD, which is an assessment, reporting, and curriculum planning system. This helps us to plan meaningful activities that match your child's strengths, needs, and interests, to track his or her progress on these over time and to build a strong foundation for your child to be ready to succeed in school. The Guild is very proud to have taken a leadership role in educating our teachers. All Lead Preschool Teachers hold a bachelor's degree in Early Education or a related field. Many of our teacher assistants have associate degrees or are currently enrolled in college.

In addition to our child care programs providing children with developmentally appropriate learning environments, the Guild also offers working parents year-round services to supplement  and support the childcare. These important services are: transportation, nutritious meals, and behavioral health services and referrals.  In doing so, we serve the whole child and aid you in your role as you raise your child.

A second site was added in 1989 at the First Parish Church on Main Street in Bolton. Both locations have grown into well-established community preschools and continue to serve families from Stow, Bolton, and the surrounding communities. Children's Horizons' primary goal is to provide a developmentally stimulating and caring environment for all children. We realize each child is an individual with his/her own interests, skills and values. We assist children in developing their interests and by recognizing their personal learning styles. We coordinate our programs with the area schools in preparation for future learning. We offer a program that enables children to learn as they play. We promote both child-initiated and teacher-directed activities to cultivate imagination and creativity. We believe the process of a child's work is always more important than the finished product. We help foster a love of learning and encourage students through developmentally appropriate activities and lessons. Each child learns at his/her own pace and due to our low student-teacher ratio (1:6) we are able to offer individual attention to each child. We incorporate all areas of child development in our curriculum through English language arts, math, science and technology/engineering, history, social science, the arts and health education. We offer individual, small group and large group activities.

The cooperative model promotes collaboration between families and professional educators and celebrates the unique journey of every child.

Philosophy:
“Learning through play” best summarizes the school’s philosophy of education. Materials are accessible- located where children can reach them without adult assistance.

And because we're run by parents, with young children like yours, we strive every day to create warm, nurturing, environments where children can explore and learn.

Our experienced team of early childhood professionals is committed to the unique and individual development of every child in our care. Each of our teachers is a professional in the field of early childhood education and has been carefully selected through an extensive interview and orientation process. In addition, all of our teachers receive ongoing classroom support, supervision, continuing education, and extensive opportunities for professional development.

We're not a large company with a cookie-cutter approach. Each of our programs is unique and designed to reflect the community it serves. We utilize The Children's Workshop Curriculum Framework, a research and evidence based curriculum created by our bright and talented education team, which provides enough flexibility to be tailored to your child's interests (which we know can change daily) and the needs of our families.

We pride ourselves on providing children and their families throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Islandwith high quality care and learning. We are committed to providing excellence in education for young children. We opened our first center in 1990, and we have since grown to 19 early learning centers. Our main objective is to ensure excellent programs, dedicated caregivers and classrooms that are warm and inviting. We invite you to learn more about our programs and to become part of our family ""where learning is child's play""!";"http://www.childrensworkshop.com/locations/seekonk";"https://www.facebook.com/childrensworkshop";"Mon - Fri:

We start enrolling children at the age of 2 years and 9 months from Auburn and the surrounding towns.  We do not exclude any family because of race, creed, political beliefs, religion and cultural heritage, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status, or toilet training status.

Religion is not taught at Bethel Preschool, but Christian attitudes are upheld by the staff and Christian concepts are modeled through  our songs, our prayers at snack time, and our holiday celebrations.

I wanted to create a program that would provide my niece with the kind of loving, engaging and creative learning environment that I longed for her to have. Our first school was small and humble, but our dedication to the families and the children that we served, was enormous. Our little school grew as did my family-all of my three children were born during this wonderful, busy, amazing time!

     In 2001 we moved to a new location in West Groton at the site of a historic mill, now called RiverCourt. Although we greatly enjoyed our time at RiverCourt and the wonderful neighbors and friends we made there, we were so excited to have the opportunity to move back to Main Street into our beautiful new school in January of 2014. My staff and I spent many months carefully planning the classrooms, playgrounds and a curriculum for our new location.            

     When you visit our school, you will see the love and attention that has been put into every detail.

Our program allows our staff to return to work earlier because they are able to look in on their infants during the work day. We have fewer callouts because Kids Corner does not close for snow days and is only closed for 6 holidays, the day after Thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve. Knowing that you can have consistent staff (Early Education Teachers and aides) caring for your child through a Licensed Program Certified through the Office of Children is a tremendous benefit. Having it subsidized by SPEC has given us the ability to be selective in who we hire to care for your child. We have a great many nursing candidates interested in working in our child daycare program as well as our other departments.

The children in Kids Corner join in with activities with the residents such as crafts, music, fashion shows, Trick or Treating, etc.

On occasion some of our residents and their families visit the children.  The exposure to the infants and toddlers as well as the pre-schoolers creates a non-threatening relationship and many of our lower functioning residents become very responsive and start engaging the little ones in conversation, stirring old memories of their prior lives. The families are able to see the parent they remembered as a child who is now responding to the toddler.  We see role reversals where the children become the caregivers who watch out for the memory impaired residents and help them wherever they can.";"http://www.sudburypines.com/?page_id=182";;;"http://www.sudburypines.com/?page_id=184";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.sudburypines.com/wp-content/uploads/wppa/1.jpg";"http://www.sudburypines.com/wp-content/uploads/wppa/2.jpg";"http://www.sudburypines.com/wp-content/uploads/wppa/11.jpg";"http://www.sudburypines.com/wp-content/uploads/wppa/8.jpg";;

I hope that your child's years with us are fun, nurturing and happy. The staff and I are anxiously awaiting your child's arrival. We are committed to providing a rich and caring environment where children can feel confident about themselves and their ability to succeed. We want you to know that your child's daycare is your daycare and we expect you to stop by, talk with the staff, ask questions, and share your ideas and talents with us.

Your child's day will be filled with many varied and exciting activities. Our teachers carefully prepare the classroom environment with many interests to stimulate self-motivated learning. Children are encouraged to grow and progress at their own pace by choosing from a variety of interesting and fun activities. At our daycare you will see happy faces, full of wonder, ideas, and things to talk about, relate to, compare, match, fit into, try out, reinvent, discover, and enjoy.

The program we pursue is geared toward helping children develop habits of observation, questioning, and listening. It gives them awareness of their own feelings, and their right to express those feelings by sometimes channeling in to other means of expression. They learn they are free to make choices. A program like ours gives your child the necessary guidance and nurturing he/she needs to become self confident, independent, and most of all happy!

The school would be based on the idea that a child should be actively involved in making decisions about his or her day’s activities rather than passively responding to the teacher’s notions about what he or she would be interested in. This idea appealed to many other parents, and with a great deal of work The Barn Nursery School opened on Winter Street in Lincoln.

The first year program consisted of one class of fifteen children and one teacher, Noreen Nolan. At the end of the first year the school settled into more permanent quarters at the Concord Scout House, which, incidentally, contains the beams of an old barn in the large first-floor room.

We continue to adapt the space in the school to our educational philosophy.  In the fall of 1970, Dr. Anita Olds, a faculty member of the Eliot-Pearson Child Study Department, was invited to visit our school. She helped us design an environment that encourages maximum involvement of the children and offers opportunities for self-initiated creative play. Then, a major renovation to the entire inside space (play area, office, and bathroom) took place during the summer of 1988. The construction added a functional kitchen area, increased bathroom facilities, staff office, and a significant upgrade in appearance and space utilization. More recently, we have modified our playground environment (introducing new structures, changing existing ones, and creating new areas) to better meet the needs of our school and our physical and educational goals for that space.

The existing school is a reminder of the enormous commitment of the parents and staff to creating an exciting environment in which the child is free to follow his or her curiosity. The Barn continues to explore new possibilities and incorporate new talents and ideas into the flexible structure that is a cooperative.

Our teachers look at each individual child in a holistic way, respecting and nurturing each child's potential for physical, emotional, social, cognitive, creative and spiritual growth.

We believe children strive to form deep, meaningful relationships with family, school and community. At Garden Gate children learn about the reciprocity of relationships, the give-and-take of helping and being helped, of giving as well as getting, and mutual care and respect for one another. Children participate, with teachers' help, in caring for our classroom and classroom pets, negotiating play, solving conflicts with one another and helping to create social rules and boundaries as needed in the group.

We believe that taking personal responsibility for one's actions, in the classroom, on the playground and in the world, leads to empowerment, self-satisfaction, empathy and a generous spirit. Our children are responsible for their own feelings and actions and we support them with words and strategies for dealing with frustration, disappointment, anger and sadness. We help them to share their wonder, joy, and delight with others.

We believe that children are inquisitive, resourceful and motivated to learn about the world around them. At Garden Gate the learning process is dynamic, involving the teachers, parents, and the children in hands-on learning. Our teachers encourage children to explore, take risks, succeed, fail and persevere. Our children are responsible, with teachers' help, for generating inquiries, brainstorming ideas, experimenting with a wide variety of materials, and communicating their knowledge and understanding.";"http://gardengatecdc.wix.com/gardengate";"https://www.facebook.com/GardenGateCDC";"Mon - Fri:

Acton Cooperative School staff and parents have been “working together to make learning fun” since 1957. We focus on learning through play, with teachers directing play in ways that allow children to develop important skills.

We take great pride in our highly trained teachers and very low staff turnover. All of our teachers are certified in Early Childhood Education, have completed first aid and CPR courses, and are parents themselves. In addition, all of our teachers have been with us for many years, most for more than 10 years.

Our school is governed by the Director and an elected Parent Board, and run by parents. As a parent-run school, each parent spends time in the classroom and plays a role, large or small, in managing the school.

This parent involvement means that costs stay low, the school becomes a tight-knit and supportive community, and parents play a unique, hands-on role in their child’s first school experience. It also means happy parents and kids! Children excitedly anticipate their parent's day at school, and parents enjoy watching their child learn and interact with friends.";"www.actoncoop.com";;"9:15am-3pm";;"http://www.actoncoop.com/images/documents/application%20revised%20sep%202014.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.actoncoop.com/images/phocagallery/thumbs/phoca_thumb_m_p9240026.jpg";"http://www.actoncoop.com/images/phocagallery/thumbs/phoca_thumb_m_actoncoop-1053.jpg";"http://www.actoncoop.com/images/phocagallery/thumbs/phoca_thumb_m_actoncoop-1032.jpg";"http://www.actoncoop.com/images/phocagallery/thumbs/phoca_thumb_m_p3230004.jpg";;

Its mission is to provide a developmentally appropriate preschool and kindergarten program in an atmosphere of security, warmth, acceptance and encouragement.  The Campbell School is dedicated to maintaining a learning environment designed to enrich all students by meeting their unique educational and developmental needs.

The school is fully licensed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts through the Department of Early Education and Care.  Located on the corner of Blue Hill Avenue and Decker Street, the school has a daily capacity of seventy-eight children.  The children range in age from 2.9 years through 6 years old.

The Campbell School provides a prepared learning environment where each child is free to act and develop along the lines of his or her own inner direction.  Teachers guide and encourage the preschool child to develop skills, which lead toward communication and self-confidence.

A child’s imagination grows individually, and at its own pace, while also functioning as part of a group.  Therefore, various modes of creative expression through art, drama and music are an integral part of each school day.  Science experiences, which help the child to understand the world around him or her, are regularly presented.  Opportunities for children to grow socially, emotionally and intellectually are a regular, integrated part of each and every day.

The role of the teacher is to understand each child as fully as possible.  An effective and beneficial function of the teacher is primarily that of observer.  While observing, the teacher is always ready to guide and direct the child’s efforts to teach himself.  In this way, the young child learns according to his or her own individual needs and capabilities.

Overall, our curriculum is designed to develop the child’s readiness skills.  We wish to provide continuity and stability, which is essential for children at this age.  Our role is to recognize each child’s individual gifts, and to nurture, love, and support in a congenial environment.

In addition, we strive to maintain a sound parent and teacher relationship of mutual respect and trust.  Scheduled conferences may be requested at any time to discuss a child’s school experience and progress.  Also, since parents drop off and pick up their children from the classrooms, they are encouraged to interact with teachers daily.

The Campbell School came to be through a unique and wonderful collaboration of dedicated, caring, committed individuals who believe in the value of a developmentally sound educational program that embraces tolerance, acceptance, love, humor, kindness and diversity.  The children, parents, teachers and administration of the Campbell School are family.  As family, we strive daily to fulfill the promise each child brings to us and to the world.

Our school offers a collaborative approach that fosters a fun, personalized and community oriented learning environment. The cooperative arrangement also gives you the unique opportunity to participate in your child’s school experience.

Our two-year program offers a “learning through play” approach that prepares children for kindergarten by making school a fun and friendly place to learn. Focusing on planned themes throughout the year, children explore their world in age-appropriate ways through art, music, movement, science experiments, field trips, guest speakers and community service. Our small enrollment of 24 ensures a dynamic, fun, close-knit community for the children.

As a cooperative nursery school parent involvement is pivotal to the success of the school. Parents assume a special role, participating as classroom aids (""Parent Helpers""). They also adopt a ""Parent Job"" and attend monthly business meetings of the school.

Maria Montessori believed that a child actively participates in the learning experience, as such; the classroom is designed to enhance a child’s cognitive and social development. Instruction is organized but also adapts to each students needs and style. Children are allowed to learn at their pace and encouraged to collaborate and help other children in the classroom.

Montessori Education is named after Maria Montessori. Born in the town of Chiaravalle, in the province of Ancona, Italy, in 1870, she became the first female physician in Italy upon her graduation from medical school in 1896. In her medical practice, her clinical observations led her to analyze how children learn, and she concluded that they build themselves from what they find in their environment.  She founded the first Casa dei Bambini, or ""Children's House” which became the basis for the Montessori method of education and integrated Montessori's scientific observations of children's almost effortless ability to absorb knowledge from their surroundings, as well as their tireless interest in manipulating materials. Every piece of equipment, every exercise, every method Montessori developed was based on what she observed children to do ""naturally,"" by themselves, unassisted by adults. Children teach themselves. This simple but profound truth inspired Montessori's lifelong pursuit of educational reform, methodology, psychology, teaching, and teacher training--all based on her dedication to furthering the self-creating process of the child. Today, Maria Montessori’s work lives on through the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI).

Our vision also includes our parents, grandparents, and all the friends and relatives that are so important in the children’s lives. The fundamental areas of natural concern, such as safety, warmth, kindness, understanding teachers and beautiful surroundings are all part of the decision making process when choosing a preschool. We provide these essentials for every child within a balanced and developmentally appropriate program. Our primary focus is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for all the children. When you leave your child at Pond Lot PreSchool, you know that your child is getting the very best in care, safety, teaching and love. We look forward to meeting you and answering all of your questions.

We will work very hard to make sure your child has developed great self-esteem while being in our program. The emphasis in our program is learning through Art and Music. We will put on several shows during the year where the children will sing and dance and learn many new songs and poems. We will also do an amazing Art show where the children will be exposed to several well known artists such as Monet and Van Gogh. We will never discriminate against any child or family based on their religion, race, cultural heritage, political beliefs, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability.

The program focuses on encouraging children’s social, emotional, cognitive and physical growth and development, along with developing in children a love and understanding of what it means to be Jewish. 

Children’s natural creativity and curiosity are facilitated and encouraged, as they become engaged in a variety of activities to promote their individual strengths and meet new challenges. This is accomplished through a variety of large and small group activities, as well as individual activities.  At TBSCC, our goal is to develop a community of curious, active learners with high self-competence, confidence and respect for others. 

We believe in the uniqueness of each child and because a child is part of a family, we feel that the family deserves our attention as well.  We partner with families to support each child’s growth and development.

The preschool years are a precious time in their lives, where their needs for love and acceptance, play and exploration, and making new connections are our priorities.

The Playhouse uses The Creative Curriculum which is based on several accepted theories of child development and current research.  This curriculum follows developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) which is defined as giving children opportunities to learn and practice newly acquired skills, challenging them just beyond the level of their present mastery.  The Playhouse becomes their learning community.  An important component of our curriculum is the family.  We want to get to know all the family members, including pets, and encourage parents to linger during arrival time checking in with the teachers and playing with their child.  As the parent-teacher relationship grows, the child's trust and security blossoms and more energy can be focused on learning and discovery.  We use our knowledge of the stages of development and child observation to set up our learning centers.  The children's interests guide our choice of materials and activities.  The teachers and parents become partners in their child's development.

Our classroom is divided into approximately eight learning centers:
   - Art which includes crafts, play dough, writing, easel work
   - House for pretend play and dress up
   - Blocks and Building
   - Math, Alphabet, Board games
   - Reading corner
   - Dramatic play (theme changed monthly)
   - Science which includes a water and sensory table (changed monthly)
   - Music and movement
   - Playground, spacious and fenced in

The children are encouraged to follow their interests and make choices during free play time.  We maintain a balance of child directed and teacher directed activities throughout the day.  As they visit the different areas, they are practicing many of the basic skills that prepare them for kindergarten.  They're exposed to letter recognition and printing, counting and number comparisons, listening and reading comprehension, observing and questioning during science time, making friends and taking turns, and developing their gross motor skills on the playground.";"www.playhouse-preschool.com";;"7:30 AM to 5:30 PM";;"http://www.playhouse-preschool.com/id73.html";"http://www.playhouse-preschool.com/id73.html";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.playhouse-preschool.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/boy8.jpg.w300h400.jpg";"http://www.playhouse-preschool.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/girl2.jpg.w300h225.jpg";"http://www.playhouse-preschool.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/boy10.jpg.w300h225.jpg";"http://www.playhouse-preschool.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/girl7.jpg.w300h225.jpg";;

We teach children in the Montessori tradition, a tradition well-researched, honed and perfected over more than 100 years. The method teaches strong subject matter foundations, which in turn underlie the inter-disciplinary 21st century skills ranging from social interconnectedness to technological entrepreneurship.

In keeping with Dr. Maria Montessori’s own globalism and commitment to peace education, we teach our children (future citizenry) the foreign languages of Arabic, Mandarin and Spanish. Our exceptional curriculum for children is complimented by schedules and offerings designed to support busy families.

The more you learn about Montessori, early foreign language exposure, interdisciplinary education and our school culture, the more convinced you may be that Torit Montessori School could be your perfect partner in the weighty, uplifting, journey that is child-rearing from birth through Elementary.

They are welcomed into a stimulating, child-centered environment which is exciting yet safe. Through praise, encouragement, support and positive reinforcement, children develop decision-making abilities, self-sufficiency, independence and problem-solving skills. Most importantly, they gain a positive self-image.

In a caring and positive atmosphere, we create a warm and happy place for preschoolers to learn. As we bridge the gap from home to school, we guide children to a continued good self-image while building social skills in a school setting.
 

Recognizing that children grow in predictable stages, we treat each child as an individual, working from the level each child has attained and moving forward a step at a time. We teach a love of learning and allow children to experience their own stage of development and help them to feel success without pressure.

We value the active involvement of parents in our program. Parents may gain valuable insights and techniques from the expertise of the staff and at the same time, share their own talents and interests to maintain the excellent quality here at SMALL WORLD. School then becomes a shared experience which hopefully will continue throughout each child’s educational process.

We will put on several shows during the year where the children will sing and dance and learn many new songs and poems. We will also do an amazing Art show where the children will be exposed to several well known artists such as Monet and Van Gogh. We will never discriminate against any child or family based on their religion, race, cultural heritage, political beliefs, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability.

The Head Start approach make the following assumptions:

A child can benefit from a comprehensive, interdisciplinary program to foster development.

Because the family is the principal influence on the child's development, the child's family, as well as the community, must be involved in the program.

The overall goal of the Head Start Program is to bring about a greater degree of social competence in children of low-income families. Social competence means the child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with both the present environment and later responsibilities in school and in life. Social competence takes into account the interrelatedness of cognitive and intellectual development, physical and mental health,nutritional needs as well as other factors. To achieve social competence, Head Start objectives and performance standards provide for:

    Improvement of the child's health and physical abilities, including appropriate steps to correct physical and mental health problems and to enhance every child's access to an adequate diet.
    Improvement of the family's attitude toward future health care and physical abilities.
    Encouragement of self-confidence, spontaneity, curiosity and self-discipline that will assist the child's social and emotional health.
    Enhancement of the child's mental processes and skill, with particular attention to conceptual and communication skills.
    Establishment of patterns and expectations for success for the child that will create a climate of confidence for present and future learning efforts and overall development.
    Enhancement of the ability of the child and the family to relate to one another and to others.
    Development of a sense of dignity and self-worth within the child and his family.

The program offers a wide range of activities including arts and crafts, music, drama, sports, games, and field trips. In addition, the children's experiences are enriched by allowing the opportunity for interaction with both younger and older children.

The Underwood After School Program is staffed by a group of professionals with wide ranging backgrounds, working together for the safety, care, and enrichment of the children in the program.";"www.underwoodafterschool.org";;;;"http://underwoodafterschool.org/Documents.asp?n=34565&org=underwoodafterschool.org";;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://files.leagueathletics.com/Images/Logos/9329_banner.jpg";;;;;;

Nashoba Montessori School, inc. was established in 2000. The director is certified in Montessori Education, holds a B.S. in Elementary Education, and is a member of the American Montessori Society, International Montessori Society, Montessori Foundation and the Massachusetts Teachers’ Association.

“The goal of early childhood education should not be to fill a child with facts from a set course, but rather to cultivate his own natural desire to learn.” - Dr. Maria Montessori

We offer an enriched curriculum based on Dr. Maria Montessori’s philosophy for early childhood development. Believing that a child’s early development is a critical factor in later success, we offer an environment that promotes a lifelong love for learning. Children are given the basics of all-future studies; Science/Nature, Math, Language, Art, Music, Cultural Studies and Cooking.

Children are free to work at their own pace with materials they have chose.  The teacher relies on his/her own observations of the children to determine which new activities and material may be introduced to challenge and ensure success for the child.  The aim is to encourage active learning.

A child’s fine motor skills, care of the environment, care of self, as well as grace and courtesy develop through activities in daily living. The sensorial materials develop the skills of observation in every sense, develop rich vocabulary, as well as an appreciation of the materials used. Language develops through many materials in the classroom. Stories, songs, poems, the vocabulary used in geography and science, and the tactile sandpaper letters all contribute to a multi-faceted approach to learning.

Math concepts initiate with concrete materials including sorting, counting and problem solving. Eventually, children move on to use the many math materials available in our classrooms.

Our small based center provides a home away from home atmosphere with a lot of emphasis placed on a more personal interaction with the family as opposed to a larger center.

Our program is known for providing a very friendly, warm, comfortable, and nurturing environment which allows children to learn at their own pace without feeling pressured.

The Head Start approach make the following assumptions:

A child can benefit from a comprehensive, interdisciplinary program to foster development.

Because the family is the principal influence on the child's development, the child's family, as well as the community, must be involved in the program.

The overall goal of the Head Start Program is to bring about a greater degree of social competence in children of low-income families. Social competence means the child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with both the present environment and later responsibilities in school and in life. Social competence takes into account the interrelatedness of cognitive and intellectual development, physical and mental health,nutritional needs as well as other factors. To achieve social competence, Head Start objectives and performance standards provide for:

    Improvement of the child's health and physical abilities, including appropriate steps to correct physical and mental health problems and to enhance every child's access to an adequate diet.
    Improvement of the family's attitude toward future health care and physical abilities.
    Encouragement of self-confidence, spontaneity, curiosity and self-discipline that will assist the child's social and emotional health.
    Enhancement of the child's mental processes and skill, with particular attention to conceptual and communication skills.
    Establishment of patterns and expectations for success for the child that will create a climate of confidence for present and future learning efforts and overall development.
    Enhancement of the ability of the child and the family to relate to one another and to others.
    Development of a sense of dignity and self-worth within the child and his family.

They decided to start their own childcare program.  These moms created Neighborhood Involvement for Children’s Education.  After moving from temporary space, they opened a center for 50 preschoolers in 1973, at 3297 Washington Street behind Brookside clinic.

N.I.C.E. first became accredited from the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs (N.A.E.Y.C.) in 1995.  Going beyond minimum licensing standards, accredited programs make a commitment to excellence.  N.I.C.E. renovated an abandoned building near Egleston Square.  The space, designed specifically for children, welcomed the relocation of N.I.C.E. in 1999.

N.I.C.E. is a multicultural/bilingual early education center, which fosters children’s self-esteem and provides a stimulating environment where each child can develop cognitively, physically, emotionally and socially at his or her own pace.

A child can benefit from a comprehensive, interdisciplinary program to foster development.

Because the family is the principal influence on the child's development, the child's family, as well as the community, must be involved in the program.

Social competence means the child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with both the present environment and later responsibilities in school and in life. Social competence takes into account the interrelatedness of cognitive and intellectual development, physical and mental health,nutritional needs as well as other factors.

    Improvement of the child's health and physical abilities, including appropriate steps to correct physical and mental health problems and to enhance every child's access to an adequate diet.
    Improvement of the family's attitude toward future health care and physical abilities.

We are a non profit cooperative school where parent involvement is crucial to our success.  Our nursery school is based on a parent-participatory model.  All parents are expected to volunteer, or ""co-op,"" in the classroom for at least two weeks during the school year, participate on a board or commitee which includes various fundraisers, and maintain the building and school grounds throughout the year.  This greater involvement allows parents to share in and add
to their child’s preschool experience and allows the children to see that their education is an important part of family life.

 The School's Board of Directors, comprised of current member parents, conducts monthly parent meetings, maintains and distributes documents to the families of the School, including the School's Handbook, financial status, current enrollment roster, and a current set of Bylaws.";"http://www.sturbridgecoop.org/index.php/contact";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sturbridge-Cooperative-Nursery-School/123671274314665";"Mon - Fri:

We provide opportunities to enhance the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical skills of your child, for future experiences. At the Riverview Preschool, we know that children grow and learn at their own pace. Therefore, we provide enriching activities that will challenge children in areas that strengthen and enhance their abilities and skills and to develop a positive self-image.

We promote the child’s creativity, trust, curiosity, independence, self-confidence, self-control, adaptability, cooperation, verbal ability, physical, intellectual awareness, and the acceptance of others. We also provide opportunities for the children to explore and learn about the world around them through topics that are of interest to them.

We welcome children 2.9 to 7 years old and have a low teacher to child ratio of 1/6. For your convenience, we offer several payment plans. Annual, semi-annual, monthly, and weekly tuition.

658608;"Purpose School";"1 CHURCH ST";"STONEHAM";"MA";2180;"MIDDLESEX";7814382815;"www.purposeschool.com";" purposeschoolstoneham@gmail.com";"During the early 1940's, Reverend Mark Strickland had a dream of providing a community service for mothers who were busy working in the defense industry or volunteering in the war effort. In September of 1943 that dream became a reality. In 1962 the addition that now contains Purpose School was built. Because of the dedication of teachers and directors that dream continues to be fulfilled some 65 years later.

​The goals of Purpose School have remained the same over the years. In 1955, director Mrs. Morrill pointed out the necessity of focusing on the development of the whole child - physical, emotional, social and cognitive. She described the preschool age child as follows: ""He is acquiring a great mass of information, broadening his range of interest, improving his skills and learning the techniques of solving problems. The Purpose School program offers a broad preparatory program to develop readiness for learning. This program affords children a natural opportunity for language development, manipulating materials, sensing meanings and relationships, developing work habits and attending social maturity. The teachers help the children learn to work and play together.""

Ultimately the success of a preschool program depends on the relationship between teachers, children and parents - teachers who love what they do, children who thrive in a nurturing and caring atmosphere and parents who appreciate and encourage their children's growth. We are proud to offer that special relationship still today.

MAP is fully licensed by the Department of Early Education and Care and provides care for children in Kindergarten through 6th grade. 

Since the afterschool period represents a major portion of a child's free time, MAP is designed to provide a less structured environment than a regular school day.  MAP offers various enrichment activities to enhance children’s interest, talents, and values.  The program fosters each child’s need for relaxation, quiet time, an environment for homework, and a supportive atmosphere.

 MAP currently services over 300 children at three different sites. 

At Memorial, our modular classroom  provides programming for children that are 4 and 5 years of age but not enrolled in kindergarten from 9:30-2:30 with a half day option and kindergarten children from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Kindergarten children may sign up for different sessions and programs depending on their schedules (morning K, afternoon K, or full day K)  and the 1st graders join them at 2:40. 

To find out more about our Jump Start or Kindergarten programs, please go to our Jump Start page
for children that are 4 and 5 but not yet in school or our Kindergarten page for children enrolled in kindergarten in the Medfield Public schools.

Have a first grader, check out all the fun activities by going to our K-1st grade program page!

At the Wheelock School modular, we offer programming for the 2nd and 3rd graders.  Go to our 2nd and 3rd grade page to see more!

At that time there was no public kindergarten and only a few private preschools in Marshfield and the surrounding towns.

In the beginning there was one kindergarten and one nursery class, staffed by a teacher and a rotating roster of volunteer assistant teachers, one for each day of the week. The total enrollment was 30 children.

A Board of Directors was established to administer the school, which was located in Johnson Hall. Equipment was either made or donated. By 1969 the present school building with six classrooms was built.

At that time, Steeple School enrolled about 250 children, from three to five years of age. The staff was professional and salaried with a teacher and assistant teacher for each class. Enrollment reached 275 children in 1972, the year before public kindergarten was instituted in Marshfield.

In the years following, one classroom was changed into a specialized room for large motor skill development. A drop-in babysitting program was also established for those who needed occasional child care in the afternoons.

Today Steeple School of Trinity Church continues to provide a quality preschool program for children of Marshfield and surrounding towns. Steeple School enrolls children in three programs: Playgroup, Nursery, and Pre-Kindergarten. It also offers an ExtendedCare Program each afternoon.

The program was run by Tara Rogers, DEEC qualified Director II. Tara and her sister Juliane Blackmore, BA in accounting, have always thought of opening a business together by combining Tara's child care knowledge and Julie's business background. After 10 successful years and the caring of over 100 children in the home, Tara and Julie finally teamed up to expand the program for more children in the community. Skribbles Learning Center opened in February, 2003. In 2007, we had another growth and opened a second location in Northboro. Skribbles is family owned and operated. We are proud of our facility and are always striving to make Skribbles the best that it can be. We are licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (DEEC) and have received the prestigious award of becoming NAEYC accredited in April 2006. The Center is open 52 weeks per year to accommodate working families. Our goal is to maintain a highly qualified staff and to offer your children the best environment during the early years of their lives.   At Skribbles Learning Center, we believe that children learn through playing. Playing is a tough job, but somebody has to do it. Through play, your child will have the opportunity to learn and explore with the many offered materials and equipment. Each child will develop at their own pace and will have the freedom to express their independence. We believe that it is the process of learning that is important and not the final product. Each child will be treated as an individual for the special person that they are. While your children are in our care, we promise to love, nurture and support their development. We will encourage each child to be the best that he/she can be and we will enhance their social, emotional, physical and cognitive development. Our mission is to provide families with the high quality care that is needed, along with offering the children a happy, safe and fun learning environment.

As one of the very first programs in the Sudbury area, Sunny Hill Preschool serves as a model of excellence in early childhood education.

It is a United Way of Greater Fall River agency and operates under licensure from the Department of Early Education and Care. The school charges reasonable tuition on a sliding scale for the services rendered to the children.

Ninth Street Day Nursery, Inc. exists to help the parents in the Greater Fall River Community place their children of preschool age (2 years, 9 months - 6 years) in an environment conducive to happiness, good health, education, recreation, good citizenship, and a positive sense of self.

Ninth Street Day Nursery, Inc. is a charitable corporation established in 1956. It is a continuation of a Nursery project conceived in 1910 by a group of women from the American Association of University Women to care for children of working parents.

The purpose of the Ninth Street Day Nursery is to promote the health and welfare of enrolled children of the city of Fall River and surrounding communities. The Nursery School, founded in 1910, was relocated to its current location at 533 Highland Avenue in Fall River in 1974. In addition to its educational program, the school provides recreational facilities and healthy snacks as part of the school day.

The purposes of the school have expanded over the years to meet the social changes and requirements of the community by adding educational facilities and expanding the staff to include teachers qualified in Early Childhood Education.

The school is open 52 weeks per year, Monday - Friday, from 6:45 A.M. – 5:00 P.M. There is not only an educational school-year program, but also a well-planned summer recreational program.";"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/";;"Monday - Friday, from 6:45 A.M. – 5:00 P.M.";;"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/images/ninthstreetdaynursery_01.jpg";"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/SDC10769.JPG";"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/SDC10800.JPG";"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/SDC10829.JPG";"http://ninthstreetdaynursery.com/SDC10866.JPG";;

Your child’s journey to new learning experiences and friendships starts with a nurturing environment in your home and extends to the enriching childcare programs at Next Generation.

I opened the first Next Generation Children’s Center in Natick, Massachusetts back in 1993 after searching—and not finding—a suitable daycare solution for my first grandchild. That search made me realize there was a tremendous need for quality childcare for working parents. I am proud of the ten locations we currently have across eastern Massachusetts. Our growth over the years is due in large part to our unwavering commitment to provide parents and their children with the highest possible care and educational experience.

In our unrelenting commitment to excellence, Next Generation Children’s Centers will continue to be innovative in the design of our childcare centers and enhance our already rich curriculum for all age groups. Our curriculum integrates the top early childhood philosophies and teaching methodology including Piaget, Montessori and Reggio Emilia.

Next Generation is a Massachusetts based, family-owned business, made up of hundreds of professional educators and thousands of families. The entire team at Next Generation is passionate about providing a safe and stimulating environment for your child to develop a life–long love of learning through play and other enriching experiences. This passion extends to our own families—I am proud to say that our top management team has children enrolled in or who have graduated from our schools.

It is our privilege and our goal to make our schools the very best for our children as well as yours. We hope that you enjoy your visit with us. Please feel free to contact us with any questions you might have about our schools and programs.

ABCD’s Head Start and Early Head Start programs helps over 2,200 young children and their families each year, prepare for success in school and life by providing high-quality early education.

Children ages 3-to-5-years-old attend 23 Head Start sites across the city. Infants, toddlers and pregnant mothers get the support they need at Early Head Start Centers in Dorchester, East Boston and the South End. Year-round, extended-day programs enable parents to go to school or work.

These programs help children learn during the most important years for brain development. They offer comprehensive support for parents and children—including health services, nutrition and social services to keep families strong.

Because Head Start knows that parents are the most important teachers, parents are deeply involved in the program. Parents are leaders in making policy and guiding programs, volunteering in the classroom and advocating for the needs of young children.

ABCD’s Head Start program is at the forefront of cutting-edge work in early education—from fighting childhood obesity, to involving fathers, to building school readiness, to training teachers to meet high standards. Partners include Boston’s leading hospitals and universities.

Whatever is in the world outside can be incorporated meaningfully in the Montessori classroom.  To a child, the world is unmanageable–it is too big, too complex and too confusing.  By careful selection of materials by the teacher, an environment is set up that allows the child to explore life on a level he/she can understand.  The materials or activities are designed to stimulate independent exploration.  This prepared environment entices the child to proceed at his/her own pace from simple activities to more complex ones.  Through this process the child’s natural curiosity is satisfied and he/she begins to experience the joy of discovering the world.  Materials and curriculum center on Everyday Living, Sensorial, Language, Math, Social Studies, Science, Religion, Art, Music, and Physical Exercises.

As the child develops a sense of pride in his/her “work”, a feeling of confidence, well- being, and joy begins to manifest itself from within.   “I can do it!” gives a child a sense of independence and personal accomplishment.  It can also lead the child to acquire a new sense of responsibility.

The concept of freedom within the classroom is one with limits.  A child is allowed to work freely so long as he/she does not disturb others.  The atmosphere is one of peace and tranquility.  Actually, the children, having the freedom to follow their interests, are generally happy and busy with their work.

The Montessori School is an “approach to learning” and as such has no distinction of class or intelligence.  It has been used successfully in all parts of the world and in all types of preschool programs.

The Program integrates Montessori teaching methods with conventional teaching methods in order to foster the optimum development of each child.

Each day, the children are presented with opportunities for discovering and learning. Experiences in music, art, science, literature readiness skills, as well as activities that promote fine and gross motor skill are provided.

These experiences are carefully planned to help each child develop at his/her own pace, socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively. There are approximately 15 children in a class with two qualified teachers. Primary emphasis is placed on a nurturing, kind and respectful environment.

Both have combined fifteen years of experience as early childhood educators in Brookline, MA.

At Tiny World Child Care Inc. we believe in nurturing each child’s individual interests and strengths. Our early childhood educators encourage children to think for themselves, to make their own decisions, find solutions to problems, and to express their ideas and feelings, all within a safe and structured classroom environment. One of our principal goals is to help each child build his or her self-confidence every day. Our dedicated staff also treasure and love children, they are able to identify the needs of each child and the areas they excel in as well as those that can be improved. They love being a teacher and know they are a second home to the children. Our teachers provide exposure to the Spanish language throughout the day, whether it is by singing a song in Spanish or by simply teaching them words in Spanish such as “agua” (water). We also teach our children Spanish through a special weekly music class.

We strongly believe that children learn better through inquiry and play, and we are committed to creating a healthy, clean and stimulating environment in which every child has an equal opportunity to learn and to grow. All our classrooms provide a structured routine, along with multiple activities that brighten each child’s own choice and expression. We will serve children and their families of all races, nationalities, ethnicities, religions, etc.

Finally, we believe that parents are the critical influences in each child’s life and we pride ourselves on maintaining outstanding communication with families. Whether it is by emails, texts, notes, etc. we strongly believe that communication with families is an important factor that enables children to grow. Our parents are always invited to join us for special celebrations such as; birthday parties, our annual graduation potluck and many more family festivities.

The Peirce School encompasses a diverse school population: students come from the Peirce district, from other Arlington districts through open enrollment, and from the Boston city schools through the METCO program. While our class sizes are comparable to other Arlington schools, our total student population of approximately 280 students means that we are a close-knit community.

At Peirce, there are two classrooms per grade. Each classroom has one full-time teacher or two job-share teachers; and, depending on class size, may have a teaching assistant. One special education teacher works with the grades K-2 classrooms, one works with grades 3-4, and one with grade 5. The special education teachers co-teach with the classroom teachers. (From 2010-2013, Peirce had one co-taught classroom per grade and special education students from other Arlington districts attended Peirce. From the 2013-2014 school year onward, the co-taught model will be used in all Arlington elementary schools so that students will receive the benefits of co-teaching without having to leave their home schools.)

Our teachers and support staff use proven methodologies and a highly effective curriculum to help children grow academically, socially, and physically. We regularly participate in professional development in order to improve our skills and offer a better learning experience for the children.

Peirce School practices and encourages Peirce Pride: Perseverance, Effort, Integrity, Responsibility, Cooperation and Excellence. At monthly assemblies, different grades present stories based on these themes to reinforce the ideas behind Peirce Pride.

Our mission statement: The Peirce School provides a safe, nurturing and challenging school environment in which students strive for academic excellence. The faculty and staff, with the cooperation and support of parents, prepare students to be caring, responsible, and industrious citizens in a diverse, multicultural world.";"http://peirceschool.info/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"https://drpeirce.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/k_lineup.jpg?w=300&h=242";;;;;

Striar Hebrew Academy is a unified Jewish day school on two campuses: the Yaakov Spellman Early Learning Center at 60 Ashcroft Road houses our early childhood program, for Toddlers through Kindergarten. The elementary grades 1 through 6 are located at 100 Ames Street.  From the youngest to the oldest students, we teach a dual Judaic and general studies curriculum, infused with Torah values, which stresses the importance of showing respect for each other and embracing individual differences. SHAS students receive caring, individualized attention, made possible by our low student-to-faculty ratio and our compassionate teachers.  This intimate environment creates a strong feeling of community, which provides a comfort level in which students thrive socially, emotionally and academically.

Families choose SHAS because they seek a challenging and supportive environment where they can be partners in their child's education. Our integrated curriculum leads students to become confident, critical thinkers with a passion for learning. They emerge as young Jews with a well-defined sense of their own Jewish identity and values. Our guiding principle is the concept of Torah u'Mada (Torah and worldly knowledge). The value of combining a Judaic and general education was the vision behind our school's founding and, today, remains at the core of our educational philosophy.";"http://www.striarhebrew.org/contact-us-overview.html";;;"http://striarhebrew.org/jobs.html";"http://www.striarhebrew.org/admissions-overview.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.striarhebrew.org/assets/images/logo.gif";"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xu5v_np9-8_BFxg3KlaYoYeC0idjLN5Iok-geAzvkuIM=w259-h171-p-no";"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xjlnRUSk47A4f7Kp1trnKzXNwcGV35Gt5gvA5_pfQoeB=w202-h215-p-no";"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hocsxQELGo22c5nmEV3FVw9RhD95P9x1OqlWwYDIAsye=s194-p-no";"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NCV2WNqHNgzF-SemgJlLngnQV6xyARR7bgWqeumlvGXz=w282-h211-p-no";;

It is then that we have the greatest ability to learn, and these periods should be utilized to the fullest so that children learn as much as possible. Our programs provide environments in which this can happen developmentally in three-year multi-age groups with the same certified Montessori teacher and assistant. Self-discipline and the reward one feels when working, naturally take place through the independence of learning. Each program provides stimulating learning experiences that start with concrete principles and move naturally to abstract. This can best be described by the progression of the single gold bead to the ten-bar to the hundred-square to the thousand-cube of which our children use so much during their Montessori education.";"http://shrewsburymontessori.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shrewsbury-Montessori-School/120109478071398";;"http://shrewsburymontessori.org/contact-us/employment/";"http://shrewsburymontessori.org/admissions/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://shrewsburymontessori.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sms_logo_new_site2.png";"https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/71486_415680211847655_755535824_n.jpg?oh=9d87aef3c48fdf44f1f02ec5ea3fb11a&oe=556FEE70";;;;;

Developmentally appropriate activities guide children as they develop socially, emotionally, intellectually, physically and spiritually from their second birthday through the pre-kindergarten year.

Our activities focus on process and emphasize creativity and problem-solving techniques The richness of our traditions and culture blend together with secular activities to provide a balance of experiences for each child. The children experience and learn about customs and culture as part of their preschool experience. Shabbat, Judaism and holidays are explored through music, stories, puppetry and celebration.

Our staff is chosen based on their background in early childhood education and their knowledge about developmentally appropriate practices.

Our mission is to provide children with a caring and nurturing environment where they can develop a strong foundation for learning.

Our school is an academic based preschool.  Our curriculum encompasses the alphabet and numerical recognition, shapes and colors, and lays the foundation for early reading.  We use the Handwriting without Tears for handwriting and the Cozy Corner Curriculum by Scholastics for our Literacy component.   All this coupled with our certified and experienced teaching teams, makes for a very busy day of learning!

In addition to our academics, we do not lose sight of the fact our students are still children.  Throughout our day we offer a variety of ""hands on"" activities that stimulate play and imagination.  This balance promotes opportunities for all types of learners to explore and find success. Additionally, we work with children on understanding the art of sharing, taking turns, and developing the self help skills needed as they mature.

All our preschool programs begin at age 2.9 years where you can choose from 2, 3 or 5 half school day (8:45 - 12pm) options. We also offer Pre-Kindergarten programs for children 4 years old as of September 1st.  Parents have the option of a 4/5 day (Tues- Fri) Half School Day program or a 4/5 day (8:45-2:30pm) Full School Day Program.  Our Pre-Kindergarten program offers a Spanish compliment at no additional cost.

In addition to our Preschool Program, Smith Mills offers a FULL DAY Private Kindergarten.  Our Kindergarten has been in operation for over 10 years.  Smith Mills Kindergarten provides children with a strong foundation of learning.  Our low teacher to child ratio provides the one on one direction that kindergarteners need to become confident readers, writers and most importantly LEARNERS!

The Head Start approach make the following assumptions:

A child can benefit from a comprehensive, interdisciplinary program to foster development.

Because the family is the principal influence on the child's development, the child's family, as well as the community, must be involved in the program.

The overall goal of the Head Start Program is to bring about a greater degree of social competence in children of low-income families. Social competence means the child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with both the present environment and later responsibilities in school and in life. Social competence takes into account the interrelatedness of cognitive and intellectual development, physical and mental health,nutritional needs as well as other factors. To achieve social competence, Head Start objectives and performance standards provide for:

    Improvement of the child's health and physical abilities, including appropriate steps to correct physical and mental health problems and to enhance every child's access to an adequate diet.
    Improvement of the family's attitude toward future health care and physical abilities.
    Encouragement of self-confidence, spontaneity, curiosity and self-discipline that will assist the child's social and emotional health.
    Enhancement of the child's mental processes and skill, with particular attention to conceptual and communication skills.
    Establishment of patterns and expectations for success for the child that will create a climate of confidence for present and future learning efforts and overall development.
    Enhancement of the ability of the child and the family to relate to one another and to others.
    Development of a sense of dignity and self-worth within the child and his family.

At Spruce we recognize that children learn about the world  through active exploration and play.  Teachers here develop curriculum to honor and explore each child's potential.  Classrooms are designed to offer many opportunities for a child to learn at his or her own pace.  Art, music, and children's literature are essential elements of our program.  Concepts and skills are presented at appropriate developmental stages and then expanded upon through both structured activity and imaginative play.

Many children begin attending on a part-time schedule which allows both the child and family to achieve a comfort level with school and the separation process. Scheduled days increase in subsequent years as your child becomes acclimated to school, allowing greater continuity of curriculum as your child grows and develops.

We feel that children of all ages should come together to learn from and with each other.  Although our classrooms are grouped and defined generally by age, all of the children have ample opportunity to work with other teachers and age groups as well.  By encouraging interchange between classrooms a greater feeling of community is experienced as children both younger and older come to know and appreciate one another.

The city provides the school with many opportunities for concrete experiences that broaden the children’s understanding of the world around them.  Cart rides along city streets and trips to the park contribute to an essential understanding of what it means to be part of a larger community.  The many resources available in the city are invaluable teaching tools.  The richness and diversity of the urban environment both informs and enriches our educational mission.

Spruce Street Nursery School admits students of any race, color, and national origin to all the rights, privileges, programs and activities generally accorded or made available to students of the school.  Spruce Street Nursery School does not discriminate on the basis of race, cultural heritage, national or ethnic origin, marital status, religion, political beliefs, disability or sexual orientation in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, and other school administered programs.";"http://www.sprucestreet.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Spruce-Street-Nursery-School/462350480548230?fref=ts";"Mon - Fri:

The teachers respect each other as professionals and work together as a team. This respect is modeled for the children and in turn they are respectful toward each other. We also teach respect for the environment, our classroom and the world around us. The children may not be able to define respect in words but they will experience it.
 
Teachers play a vital role in the growth and school experiences of each child by acting as both a facilitator and model. They facilitate your child’s ability to resolve challenges, both social and educational. They model language and problem solving. These approaches allow your child to observe, practice, and receive feedback which all lead to his or her success.
 
The multi-age classroom provides an opportunity for the children to celebrate their differences and to be leaders. We know that each of our children are unique and special. In an environment where that is acknowledged and honored, the children can take pride in who they are and what they do. The range of developmental stages is not just reflected in chronological age. This range allows children to take leadership roles under circumstances where they have strengths independent of their age. 
 
Children who receive positive reinforcement are proud of their accomplishments, but more importantly, are proud of themselves. When children have confidence in who they are and believe in their own intelligence, they will be strong individuals who will learn from everything they do.

Our aim is to foster self-esteem in each child while recognizing and challenging individual needs.

Children learn to express themselves through many content areas: art, movement, music, cooking, drama, science, nature, story telling, writing, group circle, literature, whole language, dramatic play and field trips to name a few.

Our curriculum incorporates all key components of a child's learning and development, such as cognition, music, drama, art, language and literacy, early math readiness skills and concepts, science, gross and fine motor coordination, and of course, socialization.

Our program is committed to providing a nurturing environment that fosters the growth and development of each child, challenges the potential of each child's individual abilities, respects the uniqueness of each child, and provides the tools for her/him to grow to her/his his full potential.

The philosophy of our school is based on a well proven educational theory that a child interacting in a developmentally appropriate environment will develop socially and emotionally while learning cognitive readiness skills, which are the foundation for later learning experiences.

We offer small class sizes staffed by highly creative and well-experienced early childhood teachers who regularly engage in furthering their professional development. As a result, the developmental programs used in our school are based on sound knowledge and the most up-to-date early childhood education techniques.

Our curriculum is supported by an environment that provides opportunities for each child to explore all the learning centers, each maintained with a variety of materials, appropriate for the age and stage of development.

Founded in 1913 the Guild's mission is to: Provide families with quality, affordable, early childhood education and school age programs in a safe, nurturing, environment for children 4 weeks to 12 years. Today, the Guild is the largest early education and care agency in Central Massachusetts, serving approximately 1,450 children in 7 child care centers, 100+ licensed family homes and 11 school age programs.   All of these services are licensed by the  MA Department of Early Education and Care and our centers are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the premier designation in the United  States for identifying high quality child care services.  

The Guild offers developmentally appropriate learning environments for your child. Our programs use Teaching Strategies GOLD, which is an assessment, reporting, and curriculum planning system. This helps us to plan meaningful activities that match your child's strengths, needs, and interests, to track his or her progress on these over time and to build a strong foundation for your child to be ready to succeed in school. The Guild is very proud to have taken a leadership role in educating our teachers. All Lead Preschool Teachers hold a bachelor's degree in Early Education or a related field. Many of our teacher assistants have associate degrees or are currently enrolled in college.

In addition to our child care programs providing children with developmentally appropriate learning environments, the Guild also offers working parents year-round services to supplement  and support the childcare. These important services are: transportation, nutritious meals, and behavioral health services and referrals.  In doing so, we serve the whole child and aid you in your role as you raise your child.

Founded by Robert D. Vieira and Patricia Kenneally, the Preschool and Child Care Center opened as Moppet School in 1984. The Kindergarten program was added in 1987, and the Elementary School in 1989. The School and property today are known as Maple Dene in honor of its past name a century ago. For close to three decades, Maple Dene and Moppet School has continued to fulfill the embodiment of their dream, vision, and commitment to provide an enriched, developmental education to children. Bob and Pat received their graduate degrees from Wheelock College, an institution highly recognized and regarded in the field of education and devoted to making the world a better place—especially for children and families. Maple Dene and Moppet School also offers PreSchool, PreKindergarten, Before & After School Care, and Elementary School for students Kindergarten through Grade Six.

a rolling basis throughout the year. Drop in care is available once approved
by the Kid's Club office.
***Drop in care can not be an option on delayed openings because of
staffing ratios or unless approved by the Kid's Club office.
Before School is a quiet, relaxed time to enjoy:
• time with friends & teachers
• planned curriculum guided by teachers
• open exploration & play which includes:  art, building, reading, games, gym time & outdoor time
The children may bring breakfast if they wish.  At some schools, breakfast is available for a fee.  At approximately 8:20am, children may join friends on the playground as they arrive for school.
The overall philosophy, both Before School and After School, is to help children become independent, self-reliant, resourceful, capable of reasoning and thinking, able to problem solve and make good choices.  Kid's Club is a place to learn social skills, conflict resolution and problem solving; to be ready for the challenges that face them as they confront life's issues.

""Kid's Club After School is located at 65 Phillips St. The main childcare rooms are developmental in design, allowing children to make decisions within defined limits. The classrooms include the following areas: reading and group time, computer and homework, art, sensory, sand and water, science and writing, manipulative, games, blocks or construction and dramatic play. Activities outside of these areas are also offered, such as cooking, sports, music, movement, and carpentry. Programming allows for free play, homework choice, quiet time, snack and outdoor play.

The program follows the Andover Public School calendar. Kid's Club is closed during the summer (but has a summer program), most holidays and December vacation week. It is open during February and April school vacation weeks, based on the needs of the current user group. It will remain open on snow days (depending on the severity of the storm) and in-service days.

The Kid's Club program has 200 slots. Actual enrollment is based on the distribution of slots throughout the week. Group size varies depending on the activity; ratios are maintained at approximately 10:1. The staff reflects a diversity of training and experience in early childhood education and childcare. Staff development and training opportunities are offered throughout the year.

The teaching staff offers conference time (at parents request) for a more thorough discussion of a child's progress. Written progress reports will be maintained in each child's record and are available for parental review with a staff member. This communication between parents and teachers is essential in creating a program that not only meets parents' needs, but also provides an enriching and comfortable environment for the children.""

We promote mastery of social, emotional, physical and cognitive skills according to the individual pace and style of each child. Our teaching goals are aimed at the development of healthy self-esteem, independence, and respect for self and others.

The philosophy of Hancock Nursery School is guided by the belief that young children learn best through play. As such, our curriculum encourages the exploration and discovery of different ideas, feelings, and interests during play and through a variety of media. We promote self-expression and growth through music, movement, arts, crafts, and pretend play.

Overall, the school takes a developmental approach to teaching. There are three main goals for every age group:

    To help children make a happy transition between home and school through nurturance and positive guidance.
    To expose children to a variety of developmentally appropriate experiences and encourage creativity through exploration, questioning, and experimentation.
    To help children begin the process of socialization with peers and other adults and to introduce the child to the art of negotiation and communication.

Another important goal of our curriculum is to help children learn acceptable behavior. No child is ever permitted to harm another, either emotionally or physically, and both self-respect and respect for others are strongly encouraged. We reinforce positive behavior with praise, guide children toward constructive activity with re-direction, and set a few clear limits and rules for safety and respect for others. We work on solving problems together through conversation and compromise and we help children learn to talk over differences to help develop respect and empathy for the feelings of others.";"www.hancocknurseryschool.org";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hancock-Nursery-School-Inc/300548103301908";;;"http://www.hancocknurseryschool.org/?page_id=46";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.hancocknurseryschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HNS-LOGO.png";"http://www.hancocknurseryschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Copy-of-_tuition.jpg";;;;;

Throughout the years, we have implemented traditional influences into our Montessori curriculum. Our classrooms are filled with Montessori materials as well as Traditional Learning materials. NEMS also implements creative monthly themes to help extend the learning experience beyond the basics.

As true Montessorians, we believe in maintaining small ratios of 7 to 1 or fewer, allowing for the individual attention each child needs. In addition, we have ""community time"" between classrooms. Each classroom has whole group activities and lessons, as well as whole group recess.

The primary goal of NEMS is to meet the needs of love, warmth and security in the young child, by treating them with respect and understanding. Additionally, by setting realistic and consistent limits, the children are given the freedom to explore an environment that meets their developmental needs.

People also want to know on which theorists we base our curriculum, our interactions with children, and our style of child guidance.Happy children at Knoll-Edge Knoll-Edge follows the Constructivist Theory of Early Childhood Development. This is best explained by referring to two theorists from whom we draw our thoughts.

Vgotsky believes, and we agree, that children learn better in collaboration with an adult. This does not mean that the adult is teaching a child how to perform a task, but that the process of engagement with the adult enables the child to refine his or her thinking or performance to make it more effective. The development of language and the articulation of ideas are central to learning and development. ""Stretch-learners"" is a model for this theory. We stretch the mind of the child by exposing him/her to a multitude of curricula presented in an appropriate manner.

We also believe, as J. Bruner theorized, that learning is an active process in which learners construct new ideas based upon their current knowledge. The child selects and transforms information, constructs hypotheses and makes decisions relying on a cognitive structure to do so. Cognitive structure provides meaning and organization to experiences and allows the child to go beyond the information given.

Knoll-Edge draws from the best of these philosophers and therefore is often compared with the Reggio Emilia philosophy, which is a combination of theories. Central to this philosophy is the image of the child being full of wonder and curiosity, and capable of co-constructing, with the teachers, his or her own knowledge. The central act of teachers is to arrange the environment, and offer appropriate materials, so that the child constantly explores, discovers and creates meaning.

The Reggio Emilia motto is ""nothing without joy"". We at Knoll-Edge have adopted that motto as well!";"www.knoll-edge.com";;;;"http://www.knoll-edge.com/content/admissions.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.knoll-edge.com/images/philPage.jpg";"http://www.knoll-edge.com/images/admissPage01.jpg";"http://www.knoll-edge.com/images/programsPaint.jpg";"http://www.knoll-edge.com/images/programsReading.jpg";;

Founded in 1913 the Guild's mission is to: Provide families with quality, affordable, early childhood education and school age programs in a safe, nurturing, environment for children 4 weeks to 12 years. Today, the Guild is the largest early education and care agency in Central Massachusetts, serving approximately 1,450 children in 7 child care centers, 100+ licensed family homes and 11 school age programs.   All of these services are licensed by the  MA Department of Early Education and Care and our centers are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the premier designation in the United  States for identifying high quality child care services.  

The Guild offers developmentally appropriate learning environments for your child. Our programs use Teaching Strategies GOLD, which is an assessment, reporting, and curriculum planning system. This helps us to plan meaningful activities that match your child's strengths, needs, and interests, to track his or her progress on these over time and to build a strong foundation for your child to be ready to succeed in school. The Guild is very proud to have taken a leadership role in educating our teachers. All Lead Preschool Teachers hold a bachelor's degree in Early Education or a related field. Many of our teacher assistants have associate degrees or are currently enrolled in college.

In addition to our child care programs providing children with developmentally appropriate learning environments, the Guild also offers working parents year-round services to supplement  and support the childcare. These important services are: transportation, nutritious meals, and behavioral health services and referrals.  In doing so, we serve the whole child and aid you in your role as you raise your child.

At Amazing Grace Kids, children explore, create, interact and discover, in a thoughtfully prepared environment full of interesting materials.  Using this hands-on, play based approach, literacy, music, art, science, math and social studies are woven into our daily curriculum, which follows the Massachusetts State Guidelines. Children also learn best when they feel safe and loved.  With teacher support, our students learn to communicate and negotiate with peers and adults, equipping them with the social skills that are foundational for a lifetime of interacting with others. Faith in God underlies all that we do – at Amazing Grace Kids, children learn about how God made our wonderful world and that He loves us. Teachers pray for the school and for families on a regular basis.  We work in partnership with our host, Trinity Covenant Church, to provide this Christian preschool experience to families in Lexington and the surrounding towns. Amazing Grace Kids was born of a dream of teachers Amy Hinrichs and Ellie Beatty to offer quality Christian preschool education to Boston area families. Incorporated as a non-profit school in 2010, Amazing Grace Kids began as a “Parents’ Day Out” program offered to children one day a week. By September of 2012 Amazing Grace Kids was licensed by the Mass Department of Early Education and Care as a preschool, offering classes three days a week. Enrollment has grown steadily, and as of September of 2013, we offer two classrooms and are open every weekday.  Amazing Grace Kids admits students of any race, color, gender, creed, cultural heritage, ethnic origin, and disability, to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students of the school.";"http://agracekids.org/";;"9am-3pm";;"http://agracekids.org/apply/";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://agracekids.org/wp-content/uploads/logo-500.gif";"http://agracekids.org/wp-content/uploads/20111109_Amazing_Grace_Kids255-450x298.jpg";"http://agracekids.org/wp-content/uploads/AG-69-450x300.jpg";"http://agracekids.org/wp-content/uploads/AG-74-450x300.jpg";"http://agracekids.org/wp-content/uploads/trinity-covenant-church-450x450.jpg";;

We are a daycare and early learning center that offers full-time and part-time, year round, quality care and education, to children ages 6 weeks to 14 years.  We offer Kindergarten, before and after school programs for school aged children, as well as vacation and summer programs, created to enhance the growth of all children.  All of our programs are commensurate with the MA Frameworks.  Below, are some of the things that distinguish us from other daycare and early learning centers.  We believe that children learn through hands-on experience that enhances the development of each child’s whole self: physical, intellectual, creative, social, and emotional.  As each of these facets develop at different rates, the children seek activities and experiences that meet their individual needs.  In addition, children have many opportunities to stimulate each other’s thinking, and encourage pro-social behaviors amongst themselves.
We believe that children form an extension of their families and the community at large; therefore, we are committed to providing the highest quality of care possible to children and their families, in an environment as close to home like as possible, incorporating our families’ pictures and cultures in the different rooms throughout the center.
