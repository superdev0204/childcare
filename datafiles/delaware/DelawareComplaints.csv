Staff #1 did tap Child #1 on the lips and told him not to spit.  The action was not the most appropriate response, however, it does not qualify as improper discipline.  The administrator affirmed Staff #1 did not have malicious intentions when she tapped the Child #1's lips, and Child #1 did not cry nor was he injured in any way.

There is no evidence to substantiate the allegation of telling the staff member she must terminate her child’s enrollment because during the visit both the owner and the staff member stated this had not occurred.

451;534;"Complaint";"12-21-2018";"Unsubstantiated with Concern";"A complaint was received on November 15, 2018, regarding improper discipline.  The complaint is unsubstantiated with concern because center staff stated they received a report of Child #1 being hit by a staff member and Child #1 reported being hit by the same staff member and demonstrated being hit when speaking to licensing specialists.  The staff member denied hitting Child #1 and staff members did not observe any inappropriate interactions between the staff member and any child in care.  Other concerns are OCCL was not informed of the resignation of the curriculum coordinator and the promotion of a staff member to the curriculum coordinator position.  In the absence of the administrator and curriculum coordinator, a teacher qualified staff member, trained in day-to-day operations, was not present.  Additionally, three staff members received an allegation of abuse to a child in care by a staff member on November 12, 2018, and a prior allegation was made to one staff member at the end [DataMsg: This field has been shortened.

On June 7, 2019, and June 10, 2019, Licensing Specialist Candace Donovan investigated this complaint. This complaint is substantiated for unsafe transportation practices because Child #1 was observed in the passenger front seat of the caravan and Child #2, Child #4, and Child #5 were not wearing seatbelts.
