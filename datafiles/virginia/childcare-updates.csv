It was started by faith and trust in the Lord.  The Lord gave LaVern Theus this vision and His word confirmed it (Isaiah 54:17).  Abby’s Ark  Daycare was first licensed February 6, 1991 by the Commonwealth of Virginia Dept of Social Services.  The City of Portsmouth- Department of Building Inspection issued a Certificate of Occupacny on January 9, 1992.  Abby’s Ark Daycare was one of the first in Portsmouth, VA to receive a Certificate of Accreditation for family daycare by the National Association for Family Daycare (NAFDC).  This accredit is for exemplifying the NAFDC Code of excellence and attaining the highest standards of quality for the family daycare profession.

A prophetic word was given April 3, 1998 ( Habakkuk 2:2-3).  Preparing for this vision God gave LaVern Theus clarity through the Word, prayer time, and time with Him to evolve Abby’s Ark Early Learning Center.  AAELC was issued a business  license from the City of Portsmouth  January 3, 2006 and a license to operate on July 25, 2006 from the Department of Social Services.  Abby’s Ark grew from 12 children to currently enrolling up to 42.  As vision once again prevails(2 Corinthians 8:10-15; 9:8-15), there are future plans for expansion as we secure the site for a new and upcoming Abby’s Ark Christian Academy (AACA).  “Thanks be to God for His indescribable gifts!”";"http://www.abbysarkearlylearningcenter.com/contact-us/";;"Monday- Friday

The first director and congregant responsible for filing the paperwork with the city was Joan Dale.  Joan served as the first director.  The school is unique because it is housed in a comfy secure home where children feel safe.  This setting is unique in the City. Kathy Wilson was the third director of Abracadabra.  Prior to becoming director she served as the President of the National Women's Political Caucus.  Following two terms, she returned to education where she had a degree in Special Education. Kathy brought with her a philosophy that every child is important.   She helped pioneer an attitude of acceptance and inclusion for children with special needs.  She applied this philosophy in the creation of the wonderful playground for the school which she saw as more of an ""outdoor classroom.""  It is named in her honor.    Following her sudden death, the Kathy Wilson Foundation was formed in 2005 to help preschools in Alexandria accept and include all children.  As Kathy was fond of saying, ""We can't teach just easy ones.""  To learn more about the philosophy of the ""outdoor classroom"" please visit the KathyWilsonFoundation.org.

For the third time Bel Air Elementary and its instructional staff are recipients of Prince William County Public Schools’ annual Teacher Incentive Performance Awards (TIPA) for demonstrating student growth and achievement, quality teaching, and the school environment needed to help children make major educational strides.

Unlike so many awards that focus exclusively on the results of one specific test or measurement, TIPA considers 23 different criteria to assess participating schools on their ability to produce rapid and significant academic progress among children who may start out far behind their peers.

The TIPA project makes certain we offer a climate in which success can take root. It provides targeted professional development to better equip teachers to help students succeed. It promotes the importance of an entire school working together to ensure the growth of all students. TIPA also focuses on factors such as improving student attendance and increasing student and parent satisfaction.

Thanks largely to a federal grant and support of the PWCS School Board, the TIPA recognition means our entire instructional team will receive financial incentives for the work they are doing on behalf of our students. More importantly, it reinforces the importance of that work to closing the achievement gap.

We have more work to do to improve our test scores and to ensure the academic proficiency of each and every student; this recognition confirms that we are on the right path. It means we are delivering on the PWCS commitment to continuous improvement and Providing A World-Class Education to every child.

Bethany Christian Church was selected as the location for the school, due to the fact that Bethany had just added nine classrooms and two restrooms to their building. PCS officially opened on August 31, 1970 with 31 students in first through seventh grades. In the years that followed, growth was experienced, and by 1975, kindergarten through twelfth grades were offered.

God has been faithful in supplying our needs. Bethany built the first brick building in 1973, and the second brick building quickly followed in 1974. The multipurpose building was constructed in 1987. In 1989, PCS received a donation for a playground, and Bethany members provided the installation. Upon a Piedmont student's death, the parents donated the gym bleachers. Many have given contributions to assure that expenses would be met. On several occasions, men and women have made provisions for Piedmont in their wills. Once, a principal gave of his own money to meet payroll funds. On June 1, 2003, PCS became a ministry of Bethany Christian Church so that future building plans could incorporate both church and school needs. Pictured above is our newest brick building that is used for our secondary educational students. 

We want to have a greater impact for Christ and His Kingdom in our community. We will not know this side of Heaven how the men and women serving Piedmont Christian School have influenced the lives of the students they have supported. You are invited to share in that vision with us.

We believe the environment is the “third teacher” and nurture this concept by providing a safe, playful, and inviting atmosphere where children can explore the world around them.  We value the family and enter into a relationship with parents through constant communication and open dialogue.

Research conducted over the last forty years has shown that young children process and retain new information if they are allowed to discover it and incorporate it into their own play. At Chancellor Street we transform play within a supportive and carefully crafted environment into an open-ended curriculum for learning and self-development.

Our curriculum integrates learning themes with a rich set of activities. When we study a particular theme - birds, the ocean, work, family, color, numbers, and letters, to name a few - we thread this theme throughout every activity in the classroom. Children engage knowledge about themes through science exploration, dramatic and imaginative play, songs, craft, and art. Threaded through such activities, themes create a network of engaged knowledge. As children become immersed in the theme throughout every activity, they learn to use emerging concepts related to this theme rather than simply recite facts.
Teaching the Whole Child

We believe in teaching the whole child: Our curriculum has been developed to prepare each child for her or his Kindergarten year academically, socially and physically. Each object, each activity, each space in the classrooms of Chancellor Street is designed and offered to students in such a way that children of diverse ages and stages of growth can learn something important to their own growth by engaging it.

Children learn best by doing, playing, and making choices. Much of our effort centers on having children explore the world. To this end we provide materials that children can handle themselves and that are easily accessible. Children can type on real typewriters, squeeze potter’s clay, mix ingredients for snack, or deconstruct an old radio. Children are offered a choice of activities each day as well as the ability to move freely between three classrooms. This decision-making process allows children to discover their preferences and style of learning, to work in small groups, make friends, take directions, to be in a quiet spot, or join in an active game. During most of the school day, the age groups are mixed, as in a real family, so that the children may give and receive help from each other. On any given day, we have two teachers, two parents and 24 children for student-teacher ratio of 6 : 1.
Co-operative Learning

Co-operative learning and teaching is fundamental to the Chancellor Street philosophy. We dedicate ourselves in large and small ways to home and school working together. We are actively receptive to an exchange of ideas between our families and the school. More than this, the vitality of the school depends on this exchange. Parents play a crucial role in the life of the school. Each parent assists in the classroom and holds another job related to the co-op. The families of the co-op become a community too, and it is our goal that the parents, like the children, come to make friends, share and learn from each other

At Chestnut, the children learn while having fun with a curriculum of many and varied learning experiences. While the children are learning skills, they are also developing a belief in themselves, respect for others, good work habits and an eagerness to learn.

Chestnut Memorial Preschool also offers Create, Move, Play; which, is an after school extended care for children who attend the preschool. Create, Move, and Play is available Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays from 12:30 - 3:45p.m., when school is in session.

During these early years a child is interested in play.  We, at Children’s Castle, take this natural opportunity to teach children through their play.  In order to achieve our goal we believe a child’s environment must be arranged to enhance their curiosity and interest in their surroundings while they are playing.  In doing so, this will allow each child to learn with guidance and stimulating interaction from teachers.  This provides a solid foundation for a child to grow and feel secure in exploring their curiosity of the surrounding world.  Our environment creates this foundation by providing safe exploration, encouraging children to discover, allowing children to make decisions and choices, think creatively, and to learn while they are at play.

Our Goals are:
1.         To provide the highest quality child care for the community in an enriching, developmentally age appropriate environment that supports the family, respects the individual child, builds character, and promotes a positive attitude toward one’s self and learning; 
2.         To provide a quality early childhood educational environment that is warm, clean, and secure; 
3.         To provide an atmosphere that allows children to learn through safe exploration of their environment while gaining social, emotional, language, and academic skills through loving interaction and guidance with teachers, parents, and positive social interaction from one another.

In doing so, children will be able to grow and learn at their own developmental pace.  They will be given positive guidance to easily obtain and exceed specific goals.  Each child will be educationally encouraged and stimulated daily to participate in guided individual activity, free play, and group activities, but will always be allowed alternative choices.
Children progress through many developmental stages that are common to all, but do not occur at a simultaneous rate.  Our program is based on allowing children to grow and develop at a rate that is specific to the individual child.  Children are guided by experienced teachers that are knowledgeable of each child’s personal developmental stage.  This knowledge enables teachers to enhance the characteristics of each stage, and to obtain and exceed specific goals set to aide in each child’s personal development.

Church Court Day Nursery was founded in 1959, by Rev. William Geisler and Miss Gladys Cormany, who recognized a growing need for childcare in the Roanoke Valley. As one of the longest standing Christian Child Care facilities in Roanoke, we exist to serve families in our community by providing quality child care programs which meet the physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual needs of our children.

We believe in parental involvement and that parents are an integral part of our childcare and preschool programs.

The materials we use are based on the firm foundation of Scriptural truth and grounded in the practical aspects of the classroom teaching. We believe our primary responsiblity, after the safety and loving care of the children, is to instill in each child a thirst for knowledge in all areas (spiritual and academic) that will continue for a lifetime. We believe the faculty should create an environment that stimulates natural curiosity, develops an inquiring mind, provides for the acquisition of basic skills, and fosters problem-solving abilities. Each child should be challenged to achieve his/her maximum potential in all areas of cognitive development, yet at the same time be allowed to exhibit creativity in areas that interest the individual child.

enthusiastic, self-confident, independent learners and we believe that play is
the primary mode of learning. Our curriculum also respects individual learning
styles and ever-changing interests. Through our curriculum we promote growth in all areas of development including:

social: to help children learn from adults and one another by observation, imitation, and interaction.

emotional: to provide a safe and secure environment where children can develop pride, self-confidence, independence, self-control, and a positive attitude toward life.

cognitive: to promote curiosity and to help children acquire learning skills, such as the abilities to solve problems, make choices, ask questions, and express their ideas, observations, and feelings.

physical: to help children develop and enhance their small and large muscle skills and feel confident and comfortable
with their own bodies.

Our curriculum goals are achieved through integrated, theme-based activities and conversations with adults and children.
Opportunities exist within the classroom for the child to engage in one-on-one activities with the teacher, small group and large group activities, solitary and independent play allowing for opportunities to experiment and explore. Whole
group activities are for short periods of time and are suited to the age and ability of the children.

In six months, the school's enrollment grew to include 40 children ages three, four and five, all of whom were schooled in a five-room house in the Westover Hills section of Arlington.  Within a year, the school expanded to include grades 1-4 and moved to the Yeatman home at 3155 N. Pershing Drive.

During the summer of 1942, the school moved to the former estate of General George Patton at 1401 N. 12th Street on Ft. Myer Hill.  Facilities were expanded and over the next 15 years enrollment increased to include preschool through eighth grade.  A second campus opened in Alexandria in the mid 1950s at 500 W. Windsor Avenue to house students in preschool through fourth grade.  During the 1950s, Congressional developed a new school site on 40 acres of land at Sleepy Hollow Road.  By the fall of 1960, students in preschool through 12th grade were learning at the new campus.

In 1979, the Congressional School was reorganized as the Congressional Schools of Virginia, a nonprofit corporation governed by a Board of Trustees.  In the mid 1980s, the Board resolved to focus on the Lower and Middle School population and phase out the High School.  In June of 1987, Congressional graduated its last 12th grade class.

The school's educational facilities continued to grow with the construction and opening of a new gymnasium/auditorium in the spring of 1997, followed shortly by the opening of a technology center.  Today the school boasts two technology centers, interactive whiteboards in each classroom, a host of interactive media and virtual classroom tools. Course offerings at Congressional have continued to evolve and expand, most recently with the introduction of speech and drama in Middle School and a multitude of extracurricular activities, clubs and teams are available to students beyond the school day.  We look forward to celebrating our 75th anniversary in 2014 as The Congressional Schools of Virginia continues to be a premier choice for families seeking the best possible education for their children from infancy through 8th grade.

F. Dudley Estate. It was named Dudley Memorial School in honor of Mr. Dudley who had served on the school board for some years. Grades 1 through 6 moved from Graham High School to occupy the new building. Graham High School and two elementary schools, Dudley and Logan Street, were under the same principal from 1937-1965.
   Miss Josephine Gentry became the principal in September 1965 and served in that capacity until her retirement in 1976. Irma Webb was appointed principal of both Dudley and Logan Street Schools in 1976.
A multi-purpose room was ready for the start of the 1967-68 school year. This room housed a cafeteria which replaced a little white cottage built on the corner of the school grounds. Until the cafeteria was built, food was carried from the cottage to the school each day.
   The years 1969-1974 brought more growth to Dudley as four mobile units were added for 4 kindergarten classes and a central library was established. The fourth grade was transferred to Graham Elementary leaving only kindergarten through third grade at Dudley.
   An addition to the original building was completed in the fall of 1981. The addition provided a library, administrative offices, clinic and conference areas, a special education classroom, five kindergarten classrooms, two 1st grade classrooms and a 2nd grade classroom. Included in the addition were a small elevator and other facilities for serving handicapped students. The new addition more than doubled the area of the building.
   Logan Street School was closed in 1981 after sixty years of service. First and second grade students from Logan Street School were assigned to Dudley and third grade students from both Logan Street and Dudley were assigned to Graham Intermediate School.
   In the fall of 1981, Dudley Primary School was organized to serve the needs of pupils in grades kindergarten through second grade. Falls Mills Elementary was closed in 1991 and those K – 2nd grade students began attending Dudley Primary. We also have a Pre-Kindergarten class, a preschool Early Childhood Special Education class, as well as a self-contained Special Education class. Our staff consists of 38 members, including both professional and support staff. Our school serves the communities of Bluefield and Falls Mills Virginia. Our attendance area borders Mercer County WV and there is student movement between the two areas.
   Dudley Primary is known as a caring school. We provide learning experiences with high expectations for all our students, realizing that all students can and do learn. While recently going through accreditation standards, Tazewell County Public Schools adopted the motto “Rigor, Relevance and Relationships.” We encourage accountability and have increased the rigor in our teaching. We work to develop relationships to increase parental involvement and shared decision making for the continued improvement of our school. Dudley Primary provides a safe and positive environment for all its students.";"http://dps.tazewell.k12.va.us/";;"7:50am-315pm";;;"http://dps.tazewell.k12.va.us/?PageName=%27Handbook%27";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_5696/50f70c7cff14c2ced1b83d3a6b782919.jpg";;;;;

We welcome children and families of all faiths and cultures. We believe in the uniqueness of every child. We believe all children develop at a different pace. We feel the differences which exist among children and within their family experiences should be recognized and built upon so all might grow in the capacity to relate and develop as human beings.

Fairlington Preschool provides classes for children from 2 years to 5 years, 11 months. Classes meet from 2 to 5 days per week, 9 am until Noon. The preschool is licensed with the State of Virginia.


We teach each child the skills necessary to be successful in school and life in a rich learning environment where each child is valued for who he or she is. Our classroom experiences are based on the High/Scope approach to learning. We recognize play as the natural mode of learning for the young child. Within the context of play, our curriculum emphasizes sensory awareness, independent thinking and decision making. It is our hope that children and their families will feel welcome here.

Our goal for all children is the development of a positive self concept. When children find success and approval in preschool, their confidence grows. They begin to build the kind of self-image that will allow them to reach out freely to others and want others to reach out to them. 

We believe that education is more effective when parents and teachers work together. Through classroom participation and family education programs, parents and professionals can learn from each other.

This 11th school year marks our reaching the goal of the initial vision given by God to Pastor Murray and First Baptist — which was to create a Christian School that would provide a solid foundation of spiritual, academic and innovative education for children during their critical developmental years, age 3 to Grade 4. “To God Goes All The Glory”!!

Bible Study continues to be the most important lesson taught daily. By the end of the school year our youngest READY Runners had memorized at least 20 Bible/ verses with their scriptural references, while our Kindergartners had mastered 26 Bible verses, with beginning words to match the alphabet from A to Z! Additionally, all students learned at least 1 Bible verse and story each week – so we claim 100% of our students having knowledge of the Trinity – God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit! This year we also rejoice that 7 READY Runners and 1 parent were baptized, 4 parents and 2 family members joined First Baptist; thus adding 14 from READY to our First Baptist Family. There are 14 Runners in our beloved Cherub Choir.

Our uniquely designed STEMA Program provides a different focused subject—Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and the Arts—each month with weekly visits from an “Expert” in one of these fields. Additionally, there were monthly CHROME (Cooperating Hampton Roads Organizations for Minorities in Engineering) meetings with exciting hands-on projects. The STEMA Finale Fair featured a week of STEMA Family Projects orally presented by the students, for each class during an evening program. The combined STEMA Finale took place from Friday to Sunday, May 15-17 when all projects were on display and open to all parents and First Baptist Family. Senior Class — New this year was the Senior Class, (3rd Grade) who completed their program and will transition to other public and private schools. The 8 bright, bold “READY” graduates presented powerful PowerPoint reflections that they designed in their own Finale’ Program; took a Senior Trip to Washington, D.C., read the Farewell Messages they wrote at the K5 Graduation, and received trophies at their Farewell Party!

We believe children should learn in a growing and captivating place that nurtures their every changing need.  They will have physical movement activities that develop large and small motor skills.  There will be time to develop decision-making skills through daily interaction.  Time will be offered to learn the planning of many things and to use time for talking, listening and questioning.  Daily peer interaction is important to enhance their social skills.  The curriculum at FootPrints DayCare and PreSchool includes, but is not limited to, Christian stories and songs.  Christian principles such as caring, honesty, sharing, kindness, respect and helping others are encouraged.
We are a state licensed facility that take children ages 2 years old through 12 years old.  We also offer daily daycare along with a preschool daily from September until June, before and after school care, and summer camps.

Her methods of teaching were developed through years of careful observation and insight.  She recognized that children have a heightened capacity for learning during this young critical age using hands-on materials for cognitive activities inviting the concept of “learning by doing”, engaging all of their senses. 


Dr. Montessori had three basic principles:  (1) observation (2) individual liberty and (3) preparation of the environment.  These principles help guide the teacher to “control the environment not the child”.


Children were more likely to achieve their full academic potential fostered with these concepts.  She sparked remarkable success with this whole new approach of scholastic movement internationally in over 50 countries worldwide!

Hazelwild also sponsors or hosts a wide variety of horse shows, equestrian clinics, children oriented equine group education packages, and pony ride party packages. Hazelwild also sometimes has horses available for adoption.

We are located in Spotsylvania County Virginia on the six hundred acre ancestral homestead of Anna Elizabeth Morrison. Miss Morrison was a dairy farmer, public school teacher, and coach. She established the Foundation to continue her life-long career of education and care for children.

Hazelwild has served the greater Fredericksburg community for more than forty five years as a summer boarding and day camp, pre-school and riding facility. Children who attend today have grandparents and parents who also rode or came to school or camp here. At Hazelwild, children have an opportunity to observe farm life and to learn in an operating horse farm environment. 

We strongly believe that a well rounded education in an exhilarating and healthful environment provides the greatest benefits to our children.  Through our school and equestrian programs, Hazelwild strives to provide that environment to our community, both for our young and our young at heart.

Its history is somewhat unique, in that the school predates the public schools in the city of Lynchburg. History claims 1879 as its founding date, but Holy Cross as a church-related or parish school has a pre-history.

The history of the Catholic Church in Lynchburg dates back to 1843. The construction of the Kanawha canal in 1834 contributed to its growth. Thousands of Irish Catholics were employed for the project, and many workers established their residence in or near Lynchburg after the completion of the canal. A building located at Ninth and Clay streets was acquired in 1843 for use as the first church, named St. Francis Xavier.

In 1871, Reverend James J. McGurk, Pastor, organized a parochial school. In 1874, the school was incorporated into the newly founded public school system. However, this arrangement was discontinued after one year and the school was once again an independent school. In 1879, the present Catholic Church was built at Seventh and Clay streets and the parish was renamed Holy Cross.  A request for Sisters was made to Emmitsburg, Maryland, to the community founded by Elizabeth Ann Seton. As a result, four Daughters of Charity arrived in December 1879.   When the Sisters arrived, the school was housed in the old church (St. Francis Xavier). Eighty pupils ranging from six to seventeen years of age were enrolled in the school. Initially, students were grouped into primary, intermediate, and senior sections instead of separate class levels.  In 1916, the old church building was razed and a new ten-room building was erected on the same site. For forty years, it served the academic needs of the Catholic population in the area.

In 1957, with the arrival of two large industries and the subsequent arrival of Catholic families from the northeast, expansion of school facilities became imperative. The pastor, the Very Reverend Monsignor F. Harold Nott, purchased a large double house at the corner of Eighth and Court streets and this house was converted into a high school in February 1957. Soon, this facility was not adequate to provide for the increased enrollment.

Monsignor Nott tDSC_0846ook steps to purchase twenty-seven acres of land on Langhorne Road in the geographical center of the city of Lynchburg. Plans were then made for the immediate construction of a school with additional long-range planning for future expansion. In 1960, the new school with twelve classrooms was opened. In 1963, the spacious gymnasium was added and in 1967, three additional classrooms and a small chapel were built.In 1978, a new parish, St. Thomas More, was established in the Lynchburg area. The church was completed in 1981. At that time, the Bishop of Richmond, Walter F. Sullivan, decided that Holy Cross School would be designated as a diocesan regional school rather than a parish school. The parishes that were to be a part of Holy Cross School were Holy Cross, St. Thomas More and Holy Name of Mary in Bedford.

In December 1982, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of the Villa Maria Academy announced that their school would close in June 1983. The Villa was a private Catholic school in Lynchburg for day students as well as resident girls from Virginia, other states and foreign countries. In January 1983, Holy Cross School was confronted with ways to find a solution for the potential increased enrollment. The natural response was to build, yet finances had to be carefully considered, not only for the construction but to maintain the staff as well. The girls from Villa moved to Holy Cross during the 1983-84 school year in grades 1-8. These students were accommodated by the addition of four new classrooms at the end of the elementary wing, realizing the completion of the 1960 expansion plan and making provisions for a kindergarten.

In 2009 the school celebrated its 130th year anniversary with a successful “Celebrate 130/Campaign 130” year-long event. This very successful campaign enabled the school to continue on with state-of-the-art technology and progressive renovations. With students now ranging from Pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade, the school houses Elementary, Middle, and High Schools within their campus.";"http://hcrs-va.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Holy-Cross-Catholic-School/439275065313";"Mon - Fri:

It remains true to that commitment. Keystone Baptist Church is a conservative, independent Baptist church. It is evangelistic and stands without apology for the absolute authority of the Word of God. The Academy is a member of the Old Dominion Association of Church Schools and the American Association of Christian Schools.The teaching staff is made up of teachers who have demonstrated scholastic achievement. They are dedicated Christians who believe that the Bible is the Word of God. They love God, their country, and the great principles upon which our nation was founded. All have a deep concern for seeing others not only come to a place of reconciliation with God through the Lord Jesus Christ, but also continue to live for Him.
Keystone Christian Academy has been going strong since 1976 and still continues to stand for the Word of God. A few things have changed since those early years as we Keystone Christian Academy is now a P.A.C.E. school with conventionally taught classrooms. Keystone Christian Academy has also become an F-1 school that can issue I-20's to foreign students expanding our ministry to students around the world. Because more participation in our school by foreign students, an ESL class has been made available to aid these students in learning the English language. The outward appearance of the Academy classroom is hardly recognizable as compared to the 1970's but the core values and doctrinal statement have stood the test of time and remain solid allowing the training of young people to serve God and others.";"http://keystonebaptist.org/index.php/keystone-christian-academy";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Keystone-Christian-Academy/110469632341545";"Mon - Fri:

Kid's Kollege, is a Christian based school in Chesapeake, Virginia, is a child care center providing a happy, loving, learning environment where children learn to develop a wholesome self-image and grow physically, intellectually, and socially.

Program Goals
We believe that when children explore, question, listen, build, paint, play, and sing they develop readiness for school and other life experiences. Our goal is to ensure these early life experiences have a profound, life-long influence on each child’s potential.
Our program goals were developed to enable children to become independent and learn to make decisions, do things for themselves, and to begin to think of themselves as independent, competent individuals.
 
Positive Interactions
Our goals are accomplished through children learning to interact positively with others in a way that brings about positive responses, so they can build satisfying relationships with adults and peers. Children also learn to develop self-control to become self-disciplined, self-guided, and self-directed towards appropriate behavior.  
    
Understand & Develop
We teach children to understand and control their physical world by encouraging curiosity, thinking, reasoning, problem solving, and gathering and using information. This also helps them develop a positive self-image, so they view themselves as successful, likeable, and competent individuals.
 
Our Goals in Practice
We feel it is very important to be able to communicate closely with the parents of our children. Through close communication, we can have a better understanding of each child’s needs on an ongoing basis.";"http://www.kidskollege.net/Child-Care-Center-Our-Philosophies-Chesapeake-VA.html";;"Monday – Friday, 6:30 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. ";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.kidskollege.net/image/67109467_scaled_279x99.png";"http://www.kidskollege.net/image/67109700_scaled_252x166.jpg";"http://www.kidskollege.net/image/64845744.jpeg";"http://www.kidskollege.net/image/64845789.jpeg";"http://www.kidskollege.net/image/67109702_scaled_237x166.jpg";;

The Lake Co-Op Preschool, located in Locust Grove, Virginia, was founded in 1978 by concerned parents who wished to provide an environment that would add to the social, emotional and educational development of the their preschool children. Through the year volunteer efforts of the co-op members have ensured the continued existence and growth of the school.  In 1994, our school became state certified.  We comply with, and in many cases exceed, all state licensing guidelines.

﻿

The preschool serves 2, 3 & 4 year old children in Lake of the Woods and the surrounding area.  The Lake Co-Op Preschool operates out of the beautiful, clean, bright and spacious classrooms of the Lake of the Woods Community Center in Sweetbriar Park.  Because we use the Lake of the Woods Community Center, we offer enrollment first to children whose parents or grandparents of members of the Lake of the Woods community.  Any remaining classroom openings are then filled with any parties from outside Lake of the Woods who have an interest in the preschool. Lake Co-Op Preschool is a non-profit, cooperative preschool.  As such, parents or guardians of enrolled students are members of the cooperative.   Parent participation is the distinguishing characteristic of a cooperative preschool, and in fact, the school depends on this participation in order to function. Because members contribute to the operation of the school, staff members are able to focus their energies primarily on the children.  Families become connected with other families through family school functions, committees,  picnics,  and monthly membership (PTO) meetings.  Members spend time working for the preschool through helping  in the classrooms when needed, chairing or working on a fund raising committee, organizing classroom parties, and other activities as put forth by the Executive Board.  Members are also asked to help teachers at times with general classroom cleaning, providing special materials, and generally using their special talents to benefit the school and their child’s education. Being a member of the Lake Co-Op Preschool, each family is required to participate in at least two co-op fundraisers or to chair one, as well as attending monthly membership meetings, also known as PTO meetings.  For families where both parents work, and whose schedules can not accommodate participation, contribution of additional fees are used instead of their time.  All parents are strongly encouraged to participate in their children’s preschool experience as much as possible. The strength of the parents working together to benefit their children not only makes our preschool one of the best and more affordable in the area, it also models to the children the importance of working and cooperating with other people for a common good.

Core subjects include science, social studies, language arts, and mathematics. The Bible is also an integral part of our education. Bible class is taught every day through a Christian curriculum selected by our instructors and principal. Annual Stanford 10 testing is conducted to ensure our students are meeting national standards. We combine a nondenominational, customized curriculum using ABeka, Bob Jones, Positive Action, Saxon, and other academically strong curriculums. These programs have been proven to advance children beyond the level expected for their age.

Spiritually: Our staff and administration desire to partner with our students' parents and families and covenant with them in daily prayer for each student. We provide a loving atmosphere where God's Word is taught and shown through our staff as an example to the children of Godly living. Our ultimate goal is for the children to inherit Christ-like characteristics and develop a personal relationship with God. We provide a strong Biblical foundation for students to be able to stand up for their personal convictions in the face of pressure.

Relationally: Life Academy desires that each student develop relationships with each other and Christ. We encourage independence in expressing emotion and decision making, as long as it does not result in harm or injury to the child or to others. Children are taught to accept the consequences when choices are poor, so they learn to control themselves in a group setting. Communication skills are a vital component of learning. Our goal is to teach students to be critical and creative in their thoughts and decisions.

Little Oxford House offers a unique learning environment where children are encouraged to be inquisitive, adventurous, and creative – and expected to be thoughtful and responsible. The main ingredient at Little Oxford House is a high-quality program, a curriculum that recognizes the value of child-initiated active learning is the most important. The best early childhood activities build on children's natural curiosity, are matched to children's current and emerging abilities, and allow for exploration and variation rather than having to perform in a single ""right way."" Learning is a process of ""developmental change"" — that is, a process in which we learn by relating and adding new information to what we already know, and if necessary, changing the way we thought before. Learning does not happen when children are simply told something. To learn, they must see and do things for themselves, with parents and teachers present to encourage and challenge their thinking. Children must be secure and confident in what they already know before they are ready to move to the next level. When High-Scope says adults support and extend children's learning, it means that the adults first validate, or support, what children already know, and then challenge them to extend their thinking to the next level.";"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/contactus.html";;;;"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/pdf/Application.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/images/header.jpg";"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/images/banner.jpg";"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/images/IMG_7878.jpg";"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/images/nursery.jpg";"http://www.littleoxfordhouse.com/images/parents.jpg";;

Ladysmith Primary school was completed in June 1962. When the school first opened it housed grades one through seven. It was a black school.

The name for the school in 1962 was Madison Elementary School. The name was changed in 1969 from Madison Elementary to Ladysmith Elementary after the court ordered integration to take place in Caroline County Public Schools. In the fall of of 1970, Ladysmith Elementary was changed to grades one through five. This allowed all of the elementary children in these grades west of the power line to attend the same school

Mrs. Vera J. Allen served as the first Principal and was released from her contract October, 1963 to work in the Prince Edward Country School System, at which Mr. Wilbur Chance was appointed to the Principal-ship until his death in October 1970. Mrs. M. O. Watkins served as Principal for the remainder of the school year. She was appointed Principal for the 1971-72 school year and provided leadership in the position until 1977 when Ladysmith Elementary became Ladysmith Primary with grades K – 2. Ladysmith High School became Ladysmith Elementary with grades 3 – 6 with Mrs. Margaret Watkins as Principal. Since the beginning of 1977-78, Miss M. J. Williams served as Principal followed by Mrs. Leslie Roberson, Ms. Renee Jiron, Ms. Ann Cunningham, Mrs. Jamelle Wilson, Ms. Sandra W. Masten, and presently serving as principal, Mr. Harold Pellegreen, of what was once Madison Elementary Elementary–then Ladysmith Elementary–now Ladysmith Primary. (and now we are back to being called Madison elementary)

Mrs. Barbara Rock served as Bookkeeper for 35 years since the school doors opened in 1962. Her radiant presence touched the hearts of many who worked and visited our school. When she left, Mrs. O’Neil took her place as secretary/bookeeper.

Our faculty and staff has always consisted of fine educators who serve our children every day with knowledge and love. Our program is what it is because a staff of dedicated, aspiring men and women have one goal–to do what is best for students–and are always looking for ways to achieve that goal.

At Southside Elementary, students are provided with the necessary skills to be productive members of society and are taught to take responsibility for lifelong learning outside their school environment. Our mission statement is indicative of our belief and commitment to ensuring all students are provided a variety of quality learning experiences in a safe, compassionate setting. Our students, the learners, play a very important role in the achievement of our school’s mission. In order for them to be successful, they must take an active role and become involved in their education. They must be willing to experiment with new learning approaches that are innovative and challenging. Students also aid in the developing of an environment that is nurturing and safe. They should feel free to express their views but be willing to listen and compromise when necessary. It is important for them to develop a sincere belief that they are respected and valued as individuals thus creating a sense of self-worth and acceptance. It is equally important that our students respect and appreciate others, work towards establishing a mutual trust, and create positive interactions between themselves and others.

We, at Southside, are committed to inspiring, motivating, and supporting a quality education for our students and work diligently to enhance learning opportunities that will ultimately improve student performance. Our students are taught to “reach and stretch” because through reaching and stretching, triumphs come and goals are accomplished.

Let us always remember:

A student is the most important person in any school.
A student is not an interruption of our work – he/she is the purpose of it.
A student is not just a statistic. He/She is a flesh-and-blood human being with feelings and emotions like ourselves.
A student is one who comes to us with needs and wants. It is our job to fill them.
A student is deserving of the most courteous and attentive treatment that we can provide.
A student is the lifeblood of this and every other school. Without him/her, we would have to close our doors.";"http://www.dinwiddie.k12.va.us/ses/";;"Mon-Fri 8:00-4:30";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.dinwiddie.k12.va.us/ses/files/2013/03/SES-Header.png";"http://www.dinwiddie.k12.va.us/ses/wp-content/themes/canvas/functions/thumb.php?src=/blogs.dir/6/files/2012/11/SES-13.jpg&w=960&h=350&zc=1&q=90";"http://www.dinwiddie.k12.va.us/ses/wp-content/themes/canvas/functions/thumb.php?src=/blogs.dir/6/files/2012/11/SES-13.jpg&w=960&h=350&zc=1&q=90";;;;

NRCA’s Head Start prepares children for lifelong success through school readiness by partnering with families to support goals in the home and school environment.
 
Head Start is a federally-funded preschool program which offers comprehensive developmental services to children 3-5 years of age. Children with special needs comprise at least ten percent of the enrollment. The primary components of Head Start are education, social services, preventative health and nutrition. The program focuses on the entire family, and includes parent involvement as a fundamental part of Head Start . Classroom-based and home-based options provide each child with a solid foundation for learning. Transportation is provided

In addition to the educational opportunities for children, Head Start provides many individualized educational skill and involvement opportunities for parents, included among the many avenues are literacy classes, parenting classes, educational and employment training opportunities within and outside Head Start, and parent meetings. Also, parents may serve as representatives on Policy Council, which is the governing body of the Head Start Program.

The idea was that with a little help children from even the most disadvantaged families could begin elementary school at the same level of school readiness as their more advantaged peers.

From 1965 to 1995, the community action agency, Rural Areas Development Association (RADA) was the fiscal agent and grantee for the Head Start program in Scott County, with Scott County Public Schools delegated to operate the program.

From 1965 to 1977, Head Start was center-based only, growing in enrollment to 147 children. From 1977-2002, Scott County Head Start operated both center-based and home-based options, ultimately funded to serve 181 children.

In 1995, the Head Start grant was awarded to Scott County Public Schools, with a funded enrollment of 181 children, in both center-based and home-based options. In the fall of 2003, when the community assessment indicated the need for all center-based services, the funded enrollment dropped to 173 center-based only slots, which continues currently.

Today, Head Start continues to provide opportunities to low-income children, families and communities with high quality early childhood education, nutrition, health, dental, mental health, and social services, involving parents in all services and activities throughout the program. The promotion of school readiness is at the focal point and is delivered through a program that is child centered, family-focus comprehensive and community based. Not only are developmental goals for children supported, but there is also tremendous support for employment and self sufficiency goals for adults along with support for parents in their work and child care roles.

Head Start is nationally known for its efforts to provide high quality early childhood care and education, but is also recognized as a leader in serving children with disabilities, children of migrant workers, Native American families and pregnant women. In Virginia, Head Start programs offer an array of diverse models of care to include home and center-based services options, and other collaborative partnership models of services.

These groups function independently but cooperatively, following routines appropriate to individual needs. The program is designed to be inclusive of all children, including those with identified disabilities and special learning and developmental needs.
The Center’s program is designed to include both planned and spontaneous activities in response to children’s interests. Experiences with music, movement, art, language and building are incorporated into daily plans. Regularly scheduled snacks and meals, rest time, indoor and outdoor play, and routines in physical caregiving promotes the child’s health, comfort and ability to care for his/herself. There is maximum flexibility for the children as a group and as individuals.

One day in 1754 Sarah Clark Lynch invited friends and neighbors to begin worshipping with her in her home and, three years later, the South River Meeting House was organized and a log structure was built on two acres of land donated by Sarah Lynch. In 1768, after this first meeting house was destroyed by fire, a frame building was erected in its place. It wasn't long before the membership, having outgrown this building, made plans for a larger facility. In 1791 John Lynch, who operated a ferry on the mighty James River and who would later become known as the Founder of Lynchburg, gave 10 acres of land... ""for the use... of the People called Quakers... to hold, use and enjoy... Build and uphold and repair the premises for the purpose of Divine worship, regulation of church discipline, Burying Grounds and Education of the Youth....""

We as a staff want to take advantage of teachable moments that happen daily by fostering intellectual, creative, social, emotional and physical growth and development of our students and inspire a lifelong commitment to learning.

A caring, cooperative school environment promotes cultural values and supports positive relationships and respectful interactions. We provide an environment that allows the child to learn hands on. Our priority is to provide a healthy balance of child-directed and teacher-guided activities, as well as time for individual work, in small group or large group.

Rebecca’s Rainbow believes that a stable, safe, healthy, comfortable and culturally relevant environment is crucial to a child’s growth. A play-based approach provides a child-centered curriculum that is directed by teaching staff in which children are encouraged to construct their own knowledge. At Rebecca’s Rainbow we want our program to meet the needs and goals of the families in which we serve. We look forward to working closely with our families to provide a school family that encourages a comprehensive approach to learning and growing.

The kids-learning importance of a good early childhood experience cannot be stressed enough.

We now know through scientific research that children, even at an early age, have an enormous capacity to learn and develop. If this capacity is not stimulated during these years, children miss a critical opportunity. A quality program can help children to develop reading, writing and math foundations as well as social skills that prepare them for later success in school and in life. We feel that RBDS is that quality program and we think you will too.

Furthermore, we know that early childhood development programs are successful when they contain the following elements: parents as first teachers and partners; a well trained staff; low child-teacher ratios; and attention to each child’s cognitive, social, emotional and physical development. We have achieved these elements at RBDS.

Fun, inspirational, educational and comforting are terms that best describe the facility. Classrooms are bright and natural light streams in from the windows around the room. Artwork is displayed on the walls and comfy corners are available for reading and quiet time. Children are carefree and happy at RBDS.

We have dedicated our greatest efforts to create an early education model that truly meets the needs of all children. We are confident that once you visit RBDS, you will be most pleased with your experience. Call us to schedule a visit today

Children are encouraged to develop self-discipline and a respect for others.  We maintain a nonsexist, non-racist setting for children's learning.  We believe it is important to enhance the development of a positive self-image in each child.  We accomplish this by providing warmth and nurturing in a growth-facilitating environment rich with opportunities to learn and discover. 
Our goal is to provide parents with an open, welcoming atmosphere to encourage and promote parent involvement and parent peace of mind.  We work to develop a one-to-one relationship with each child and parent, communicating to the child that they are ""cared about"" as well as ""cared for"".  We accomplish this by providing the best suited staff; qualified and dedicated to understanding the needs of the children and families.
Further, we seek to extend the children's environment beyond the classroom and into the community.
We are committed to advocating for all children, reaching out into the community and the state to advocate for high quality care for all families.
 It is the policy of Salem Child Development Center that no person shall be discriminated against by reason of race, color, religion, disability, sex, age or national origin.

It was started with a passion to educate future generations to love God and serve Him with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength. A Christ-centered, Bible-based curriculum is of vital importance at SVCA. Bible classes are offered at every grade level. Regular chapel services challenge students to live for God and seek His will for their lives.

For 38 years SVCA has graduated young men and women at a high academic level that has enabled them to attend the universities of their choice. Our graduates have excelled at Harvard, UVA, William and Mary, the Air Force Academy, Virginia Tech, James Madison, and Liberty University, just to name a few. They have gone on to become doctors, nurses, lawyers, college professors, computer technicians, missionaries, pastors, business owners, civil servants, and skilled craftsmen. Several have returned to SVCA to teach in the elementary and upper school.

SVCA has great teachers! Our teachers have decades of experience and love teaching. Their skills, training, and experience combine to provide a high quality education. They also love their students, and it shows in the bonds they form with them. The teachers invest time with students, both inside and outside the classroom. Most importantly, SVCA teachers love the Lord and are committed to serving Him.

SVCA offers a challenging curriculum with an emphasis on critical thinking skills. Tutors are available to offer assistance during class time and after school. SVCA also works with Frederick County to offer special education speech and developmental therapy for students with special needs. SVCA students in pre-school through eighth grade take fine arts classes to encourage creative expression and appreciation for music and the visual arts. Our elementary and middle school curriculum is further supplemented with foreign language and physical education. In addition to the strong core classes, high school students are offered a variety of interesting electives such as drama, sports management, American Sign Language, and art. Dual enrollment allows students to take college courses to gain college credit while still in high school. Many students also gain college credit by passing CLEP tests because of the strong academic foundation they received at SVCA.

At St. Joseph School both children and adults strive to uphold the dignity of all human life, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion because every human is a unique creation of God, made in His image and likeness.

Emulating Christ, the Master Teacher, the faculty and staff are committed to the total growth and development of each child. We look to foster the children's intellectual progress as well as their spiritual, emotional, social, and physical maturity. St. Joseph School believes that each of these areas is interconnected and that each must be given adequate attention and encouragement for the complete education of its students. To accomplish these goals, the school must provide a safe and nurturing environment where the staff utilizes multiple techniques and strategies to further the students' academic and spiritual growth.

In partnership with the parents, St. Joseph School participates in the formation of the children as they grow in the love of Christ, commitment to faith, and service to others in the world. This mission of unity will instill a foundation that empowers the students, who are the learners of today, to be the teachers of tomorrow. The Christ-like atmosphere of respect, love, and concern becomes the framework for the instructional program at St. Joseph School, inspiring a lifetime value system for each student.";"http://www.sjschoolva.org/";;"8:00 AM – 4:00 PM";;"http://www.sjschoolva.org/page.cfm?p=350";"http://www.sjschoolva.org/page.cfm?p=498";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.sjschoolva.org/uploaded/home_photo_rotation/Rainbowsmall.JPG";"http://www.sjschoolva.org/uploaded/Right_Banner/anne.JPG";"http://www.sjschoolva.org/uploaded/Right_Banner/girlrosary.JPG";"http://www.sjschoolva.org/uploaded/home_photo_rotation/WOW1.jpg";;

Nearly 25 million pre-school aged children across the United States have benefited from Head Start.  It is designed to foster the healthy development of three and four year old children from low-income families.  Early Head Start evolved out of Head Start’s long history of providing services to infants and toddlers.  The recent advances in the field of infant development make this an especially exciting time to have Head Start formally expand its family to include the provision of Early Head Start services.  STEP provides education, nutritious meals, and the opportunity for the social, emotional, and intellectual growth that helps to prepare the children for success in school and life.  In addition, STEP Head Start provides medical and dental support services.  The Head Start approach serves the entire family and seeks to empower both parent and child.

STEP Head Start/Early Head Start is funded to serve 210 clients which include children from birth through age five in Franklin and Patrick counties.  With over 50 staff members, Head Start/Early Head Start employees include Head Start teachers and teacher assistants, Early Head Start caregivers, family service specialists, Early Head Start family educators, health advocates, and transportation specialists.

In Patrick County, we have three Head Start classrooms, two Early Head Start classrooms, and an Early Head Start home base option.  In Franklin County, we have three Head Start classrooms and an additional three collaborative Head Start classrooms.  Our collaborative classrooms are partnerships with Franklin County schools where our students attend the same class as other pre-kindergarten students.  We also have four Early Head Start classrooms and the Early Head Start home base option in Franklin County. 

Classrooms are open from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. with some variations in hours depending on location.  Early Head Start operates year round with some time off for holidays and staff training.  Head Start generally operates from August to May with some time off for holidays and staff training.
STEP’s Head Start partners with Franklin County Public Schools, Patrick County Public Schools, Infant and Toddler Connection of Virginia, and Piedmont Community Services in both counties to support the growth and development of children and families with the ultimate goal of school readiness.

In the early years of the school, an attempt was made to maintain a full K-12 program.  About a decade after the school’s inception, the financial pressures of operating a full high school took their toll.  In the early 1980’s, the leadership of the School made the decision to discontinue the upper grades, and focus on developing and growing the best elementary program possible.  God blessed that decision, and the following years proved to be an exciting time of growth and educational excellence.

In October of 1996, J.D. Surbaugh became the pastor of Temple Baptist Church.  With nearly thirty years experience in Christian Education, Pastor Surbaugh brought a tremendous love and commitment for the Christian school.  With his vision for expanding the school, and the leadership of the Holy Spirit, Temple Baptist Church once again stepped out in faith.

In August of 1998, Temple Christian Middle School began with a seventh grade.  The eighth grade was added the following year.  God continued to bless the efforts here in Madison Heights.

Then in August of 2004, the Church family made a giant leap of faith as they not only made the commitment to add a high school, but also to begin preparations to build a 22,000 square feet educational wing.  A ninth grade was added that fall with successive grades being added over the next three years.  In May of 2008, Temple Christian School celebrated its first high school graduation in nearly twenty years.

The 22,000 square feet building was completed in the summer of 2006.  And by what can only be explained as a miracle of God, the entire project was paid in full by August of 2008.

God’s gracious hand has been evident throughout the history of Temple Christian School, and we look forward to many more years of serving our community as He tarries His coming.

The Day Care’s Executive Director bears primary responsibility for its daily operation.

The Day Care center is open from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and offers a developmentally appropriate program for children 2-1/2 years through 5 years whose parents work or are in training. We welcome children of all races, faiths, and ethnic backgrounds and work to support the wide variety of families represented within our day care program.

Fees are determined on a sliding scale based on the family’s gross income. The Day Care is funded through registration fees, tuition, contributions, and USDA Child Nutrition program.

Early childhood is the most critical period in human growth and development because the foundation for learning is build during this period. Learning experiences for young children must therefore be diverse, creative and carefully planned based on sound principles of child development.

We are not a day care provider.  We are a religious exempt preschool offering both social and educational services that help your child become ready for school.

We focus on loving and caring for your child while developing social skills, such as making new friends and learning to share and interact with other children. We also encourage the physical development of your child through creative play and gym time and fine motor skills that begin with learning to hold a pencil/crayon and write letters and numbers and color and draw.

We continue their educational development with creative teaching and activities that engage students and teach them the basics of shapes, colors, and numbers as well as phonetic recognition to begin reading.  Creativity is also developed and enhanced through projects, pretend play, and our music program.

We hope that each child's experiences at WEMS will allow them to develop a sense of self-confidence that encourages inquisitiveness, initiative and independence in learning for the joy of learning.

Our lead and assistant teachers are certified by the American Montessori Society (AMS).  All teachers use their expertise to function in a team approach to provide a well-rounded learning environment for your child.  Most importantly, our teachers love to work with children!

We want to share with you the respect and delight that we take in your child's growth.  In this regard, we offer many opportunities for you to share this important environment with them.  As a parent, you are encouraged to visit the classroom and attend parent evenings, events and field trips to allow you to get to better know our school and staff.

Our curriculum is based on an understanding of how children grow and develop, and how they learn and attempt to make sense of the world around them.  Our belief is that children acquire this knowledge about their physical and social worlds through play and interaction with other children, adults and objects.  

We currently serve 74 students, ages 2-1/2 through 5.

The preschool is licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and we are proud that the preschool has been recognized by Northern Virginia Magazine as one of the top preschools in the area.

Westminster Weekday Preschool accepts children of all racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds, including children with special needs. Our program is ecumenical in our observance of seasonal and religious holidays.

The preschool is administered by a Board of Directors consisting of parents, church members, and staff, under the direct authority/supervision of the Session, the ruling body of Westminster Presbyterian Church.";"http://www.wpc-alex.org/preschool";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Westminster-Presbyterian-Church-Alexandria-VA/211104082236550";"Monday - Friday 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/1022/WWPLogo_Color.jpg";"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/1022/WWPStaff201320142_lg.jpg";;;;;

Seeing us as an organization without barriers makes us very accessible to our members and helps us to make a true difference for those who need it most.

Research shows that this is the time when the brain is creating new connections and developing at the most rapid pace it ever will. With each passing second during these first 5 years, young brains develop 700 synapses, the neural connections that support learning and the development of skill sets.

Accordingly, it is important to take advantage of this incredible time—the brain absorbs information like a sponge.

A child's development rests primarily on the environment, exposure, and attention received during these formative years. Habits and interests formed young generally reverberate throughout adult life.

Our philosophy at The Madame Curie School is to provide a nurturing environment where ideas abound. Our goal is to nurture your child to be a problem-solver early in life so that he or she may deliberate, look for, and discover solutions in both academic and everyday situations. Academically, we want to inculcate enjoyment in the mystery of Science, the empowerment of Math skills, the beauty of language, the fun in play, and—in general—the sheer joy of learning.

Beyond that, we want to impart students with the wisdom we would like them to bring into adulthood—kindness, compassion, respect and self-esteem.";"http://madamecurieschool.com/contact.html";"https://www.facebook.com/madamecurieschool";;;"http://www.madamecurieschool.com/forms.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://madamecurieschool.com/images/logo.jpg";"https://scontent-nrt.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10685510_811653555557245_5134961885390396115_n.jpg?oh=507efab29ffa5e2250a78664dbf7355a&oe=557FDA5A";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10928828_804781682911099_8253898871459124128_n.jpg?oh=0790221fcfbe9e87c919ebc745b6e7bd&oe=55949A20&__gda__=1434106896_de69fccf3bc4488b9ce23441b817e565";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10403295_804782362911031_879537746869277685_n.jpg?oh=679ce58f7f7422c6d93e3cc400d77ab1&oe=5587BF54&__gda__=1434351654_ed125819afdc384475be4f6a03db0ad9";"https://scontent-nrt.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10424276_755008054555129_4489473174666278272_n.jpg?oh=0f519777e5689a914f2e6aaa859140b3&oe=5594207E";;

Learning to program a computer, rather than just passively responding to it, is an intellectual challenge which can be experienced on many levels, from the very simple to the extremely sophisticated. The intense interaction that occurs between kids and computers has positive benefits:  it can improve math and reasoning skills, reading ability, and ignite a positive attitude toward learning. TIC Summer Camp’s philosophy is that intellectual attention, independence, affectionate appreciation, creative learning, and fun all go together.

We are not only about technology, but about content: campers learn geometry intuitively while programming with LOGO turtles; they learn fundamentals of sports through games and gain physical confidence; they act out camper-created skits and plays on bare sets; kids film from original scripts and learn to edit their movies. Our counselors—who are wonderful role models—believe that real caring means not only hugging kids, but respecting them as creators, athletes, actors, and learners.

At TIC Summer Camp, the individual needs of the child come first. In technology, a ratio of one counselor to every four campers allows real individualized instruction, giving each child all the time and attention he or she needs. In the sports program, a rich array of choices allows every child to grow athletically, doing what he or she likes to do best – or trying something new. TIC is an opportunity for children to learn now and for the future – and have fun in a supportive and joyous camp atmosphere.";"http://www.ticcamp.com/locations.html";;;"http://www.ticcamp.com/applyjob.html";"http://www.ticcamp.com/enrollcampers.html";;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://www.ticcamp.com/images/common/header.gif";"http://www.ticcamp.com/images/inside/whytic/photo1.gif";"http://www.ticcamp.com/images/inside/ourstaff/photo1.jpg";"http://www.ticcamp.com/images/inside/ourhistory/photo1.gif";"http://www.ticcamp.com/images/inside/girlsattic/photo1.gif";;

Sara and Nic wanted to provide a solid foundation for children entering Kindergarten in a safe and calm environment with a low student to teacher ratio. This foundation emphasizes outdoor play, Spanish, math, science, reading, art and music.  

The creation of Ivy School House began after Sara and Nic's son graduated from preschool.  After his graduation, Sara and Nic opened a Summer Camp for Pre-K children.  Now, they are broadening their vision of creating a balance between play and learning with an understanding of the working parent's schedule.  Sara's experience as an educational administrator for high ability students provided the vision for the Ivy School House program and curriculum.  

Ivy School House is a preschool program designed to engage students intellectually through activity and play with daily Spanish integration in a safe environment.  Each week students explore the arts, sciences, and humanities through enriching activities.  Though we find great value in technology, we are an unplugged campus, meaning students will be learning through hands-on involvement, not behind a screen.  

At Ivy School House, everything is included:  a healthy snack, enrichment programs, and language immersion.";"http://www.ivyschoolhouse.org/";;;;"http://www.ivyschoolhouse.org/#!contact/con8";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/36b97f51969a1858e29eb53e71fca418.jpg_srz_p_340_378_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/9ffd46987185699c9144b393b57078b8.jpg_srz_p_537_378_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";;;;

About Students, we believe that students deserve the opportunity to reach their maximum learning potential in preparation for life-long learning and success in a changing society.

About Parents, we believe that parents should be informed and involved in a cooperative effort with school employees making them the best allies of the school community.

About Teachers and Support Staff, we believe school employees should be dedicated empathetic, patient, and flexible in their roles with students, inspiring and encouraging students and creating a loving atmosphere where all students can achieve success.

About Curriculum, we believe that the curriculum should be multi-leveled allowing for the participation of all students, integrated and cross-curricular, comprehensive and aligned with but not governed by state standards.

About Instruction, we believe that instruction should be child-centered and based on students’ needs, accessible to all students, relevant, engaging and meet every child at his/her performance level.

About Learning, we believe that learning is a life-long process in which students have the freedom to explore opportunities, grow from their mistakes, and make relevant purposeful connections.

About Assessment, we believe that assessment should measure each child’s progress and be diagnostic in nature, indicating students’ strengths and weaknesses and guiding instruction.

About Discipline/School Climate, we believe that the school-wide discipline plan should include clear and consistent expectations and procedures and at the same time consider individual student dignity and needs, supporting a safe learning environment, maximizing learning time and developing responsible students.

About Facility, we believe our school should be safe, inviting and accessible to all, providing appropriate arrangement of learning space, supporting a variety of teaching methods and enhancing the learning experience of all students.

The teachers speak English, Russian, and some French to the children. At this stage of their lives, the children can effortlessly absorb language like a sponge, not only in terms of vocabulary, but also the building blocks of language and the sounds that allow a person to speak accent free. One parent whose child graduated from Falls Church Preschool and is now attending Congressional School recently gave a testimonial that her child is now speaking fluent French at Congressional because of the language foundation the child received during early development at Falls Church Preschool.";"http://www.fallschurchpreschool.com/mobile/about-us-a.html";;"7:15AM to 6:00PM";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

The organization is designed to educate the children of Christian parents.  It is not a part of any denomination.  Touch Hearts uses the following foundation upon which the organization is operated:

    The basis of all meaningful life is the believe in God and Jesus Christ as the only way to personal salvation.

    The Bible is the only inspired, inerrant, authoriative Word of God.

    The Bible is the main avenue by which we can come to know God and His rule for our lives.

    We need this Word in order to correctly understand God's general revelation which includes creation and life around us.  All of life needs to be interpreted in the light of God's Word.

    Christian education's aim is to relate the Christian faith and Biblical teachings directly to all of knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge in daily life, physical, spiritual, emotional and social growth (Luke 2:52).

    The primary authority and responsibility of educating children rests with the parents (Deuteronomy 6 and Ephesians 6).  The authority of the teacher in discipline and character training is derived from the fact that he stands in loco parentis, and the teacher derives authority in subject matter from faithfulness to the laws of God in special and general revelation.

    The Christian community is responsible for supporting and ecouraging Chrisitian education for its children.  It is because of these principles that Touh Hearts Christian School was established.  It is the schools desire to provide a high quality Christian education for children from Christian homes.

The prepared environment contains a wide variety of scientifically designed materials from which a child may choose what is appropriate for her. The Montessori teacher acts as a guide to connect the child to the environment by observing the child’s needs and presenting materials to meet that particular stage of development. The guide encourages exploration, and practice until the child reaches mastery. She gently establishes a culture of caring and support in the classroom community through the grace and courtesy lessons and role modelling. Awareness of the interconnectedness of all living things and the environment is offered to the children from the very beginning, and they are encouraged to be caretakers of the earth.

Imagine children having so much fun in school that they can’t wait to arrive each morning. The excitement of our preschoolers is the result of a team effort. Our teachers are enthusiastic about developing lifelong learners. They genuinely care about children, and have the sensitivity and knowledge to understand a child’s individual developmental needs and learning styles.

Our learning environment is built around children and their needs. It’s a place where children feel safe and ready to absorb what the world has to offer. Our classrooms feature well-equipped learning centers to allow hands-on practice of new skills in smaller groups.  Outdoor time on our playground is built into every day’s schedule, weather permitting.

Nothing is more important than your child’s safety. We maintain records of those authorized to pick up each child. No child is released without proper authorization. All visitors to our school are greeted, asked to sign the Visitor Log and state the purpose of their visit. Picture identification is required from all unfamiliar visitors.

We know that parents play a critical role in their child's educational success and positive attitude toward learning. So, building and maintaining strong parent-teacher relationships is crucial to everything we do here. For children to get the best possible education, everyone needs to be involved. We’re proud that at our school, effective communication among parents, teachers and staff is a way of life.

After you've had the opportunity to review our website, please feel free to contact us to schedule a private tour. We look forward to meeting with you to gain an understanding of your child’s educational needs, and discussing how our school can meet them.";"http://ashburnvillage.chesterbrookacademy.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/ChesterbrookAcademy";"6:30 am - 6:30 pm";;"http://ashburnvillage.chesterbrookacademy.com/uploaded/preschool_template/Documents/app_preschool_5_5_05.pdf";"http://ashburnvillage.chesterbrookacademy.com/uploaded/preschool_template/Documents/Chesterbrook_Preschool_Parent_Handbook_8_9_06.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://ashburnvillage.chesterbrookacademy.com/uploaded/preschool_template/images/preschool_top.gif";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11042669_969201033097820_1659162599309973739_n.jpg?oh=c6a203cbce238cff1d7f32b53b3b59e3&oe=55BBCD79&__gda__=1433427883_701fe07f5703c93e41e5f78b696c6695";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10421341_969168149767775_2173272631920684684_n.jpg?oh=178f355856538e084051604f728620b7&oe=558D8435&__gda__=1434717320_83d6871d874b2687b257e1c3f31fc6ec";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11008413_969112193106704_5786482839258717371_n.jpg?oh=145a9f665606934441b3171387ffcfe3&oe=558AA779&__gda__=1434929993_78082f6e57bc3e89e191beeb979f95bc";"https://scontent-nrt.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11042671_969110929773497_1439690157985833383_n.jpg?oh=62d0a83cf8fb9c7e2997af53668098cd&oe=557307EB";;

The programs at our school focus on the development of each child’s full potential using teachers specially trained in the Montessori Method and philosophy. Montessori teachers use both concrete teaching materials and a well-defined innovative curriculum tailored to each three-year cycle.

 The three-year age range in each class provides a multitude of benefits that are immediately apparent when observing a typical Montessori classroom.  Younger children in each group have an opportunity to observe and imitate the older students as they work.  Older students have an opportunity to reinforce their own knowledge by explaining what they are doing and assisting younger children.  The third year in the cycle is truly empowering to the children, both socially and academically.  Each child can learn and develop at his own pace within a classroom that accommodates many levels of ability and complexity.

 The Montessori teacher is specially trained to observe each child and to design lessons based on that child’s natural curiosity and love of learning. The teacher is responsible for preparing the educational environment within each classroom and for presenting lessons in that environment.  During the course of a day, the teacher will demonstrate a wide array of concrete sensorial materials and sequential activities through individual instruction.  The child soon learns to associate abstract concepts with hands-on experience.";"http://www.bridgewatermontessori.com/contact/";;;;"http://www.bridgewatermontessori.com/admissions-forms/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.bridgewatermontessori.com/assets/images/base/logo.png";"http://www.bridgewatermontessori.com/assets/images/general/BMW_Del.JPG";"http://www.bridgewatermontessori.com/gallery/";;;;

During these early years, learning experiences for children must be diverse, creative, and carefully planned based on sound principles of child development. 

Our philosophy is that young children learn best by doing.  Learning isn't just repeating what someone else says; it requires active thinking and experimenting to find out how things work and to learn firsthand about the world we live in.

In keeping with this philosophy, we provide a loving and relaxed environment for children from ages 2½ ‑ 5 where they can grow and develop at their own rate, develop a positive self‑image, learn to handle their emotions in an appropriate way, act on their environment, develop a sense of personal responsibility, and learn to trust and care about those around them.

The most important goal of our program is to help children become enthusiastic learners. We encourage the children to be active and creative explorers who are not afraid to try out their ideas and to think their own thoughts in order to become independent, self-confident, inquisitive learners.";"http://www.providenceiiipreschool.com/Parent_Handbook.html";;"9am-noon";;"http://www.providenceiiipreschool.com/Enroll.html";"http://www.providenceiiipreschool.com/Parent_Handbook.html";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.providenceiiipreschool.com/Photo_Gallery.html";;;;;

Through the collaborative model of the Partnership for Families, NFLC provides meaningful educational opportunities for individuals and families in Richmond’s Northside. The Partnership for Families brings together a number of community service agencies, including the VCU Health System Child Care to respond with an all inclusive approach to the complex needs of children and families. Located in the center of the Northside community, the children are surrounded with opportunities to interact daily with all that the city has to offer. An enriched environment for discovery provides experiential learning opportunities that maximize the development of each child.

Blessed Assurance Christian School is a preschool in rural   Orange County which currently serves three, four and five year old children.  We strive to instill an overall love for learning through enjoyable, developmentally appropriate experiences.  Our curriculum (Joyful Hearts: Bible and Rhyme) is a chronological study of Bible stories, rhyming, and letters which correlates traditional nursery rhymes with Bible stories and verses. Memorization of Bible verses happens when the verses are set to the tune of many well-known children's songs.

Our school stresses the importance of principled behavior with emphasis on honor, integrity and personal responsibility.

We endeavor to prepare our students for all levels of education beyond secondary school so that each child will adapt to a rapidly changing world and make a worthwhile contribution to our democratic society. The Board of Directors, administration, faculty and staff believe that our students should view their youth as a time of accomplishment in which they greatly expand their knowledge of themselves, our nation and the world. We want our students to experience and cultivate an awareness of intellectual, physical, social and emotional development as important ingredients in the quality of life.

Our function is to challenge our students at all academic levels and to instill just, moral and democratic values. We believe our students need experiences in responsibility, critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, creativity, leadership, decision making and communicative skills.

Since our student population encompasses several communities, we utilize this diversity to broaden our students’ horizons and help them develop an understanding of others.

E.R. Welch.  For the first while, a meeting place was shared with the Baptist church. In 1903, a small frame church was built on the corner of 11th and Henry Streets. This church burned in 1908 and the congregation met in the Band Hall until another church was erected on the corner of 10th and Jackson Streets.  During this time, the church was under the supervision of First Methodist Church. In 1915, Rosemary, along with Smith and New Hope Methodist churches, became Rosemary Charge, independent of First Methodist. Rev. R. F. Taylor was the pastor.  This combination was retained until 1940 when Rosemary became an independent charge. The congregation grew and Sunday School classrooms were added to this building until the present building was begun in 1952.

Gardner was a Harvard scholar; studying work on the development of children's cognitive processes based on the work of Jean Piaget. Through his own work on the development of cognition, he came to view those of Piaget as too narrowly focused. In his innovative theory, he presents a new framework for considering the gifts of children. Through studying other cultural definitions of intelligence, neurophysiology, anthropological studies and his own experimentation and observation of children, Gardner originally devised seven categories of respective intelligence. These are: verbal / linguistic; logical / mathematical; spatial; bodily / kinesthetic; musical; interpersonal; and intrapersonal. While Gardner contends that all humans have some degree of all seven intelligences, there are those who are more gifted in some areas, or in combinations of areas, than in others. Gardner has added an intelligence that often times left out of curriculum planning alluded to as “existential intelligence.” Animated Child has added “Global Smarts” as the 8th intelligence at our facility. We believe that children should be exposed to all the world has to offer from language to culinary culture. We look forward to opening up a whole new definition of “Intelligence.""

With an emphasis on a literature-based curriculum, the school offers opportunities for intellectual enrichment and personal growth through study that crosses the academic disciplines. Instruction in music, art, drama, public speaking, athletics, and computer technology as well as participation in extra-curricular activities augment the traditional challenges of our program.

The school motto is “we learn not for school but for life” and you will find that it permeates though every aspect of our culture here at Powhatan. Powhatan combines rich and innovative educational programming in a dynamic and highly personalized community. Our literature-based curriculum provides a strong academic foundation for our students and creates a positive atmosphere that encourages lifelong learning. Powhatan believes that academic growth rests on a solid base of positive social and emotional development. In order to foster this goal, we emphasize the building of classroom community throughout the school. As they grow intellectually and socially, our students prepare to move on to upper schools as effective members of their future communities.

At Powhatan, education extends beyond the classroom. Students are exposed to performing and fine arts through hands-on learning activities and field trips. All students participate in sports activities to ensure good physical health, resulting in positive attitudes for learning. Powhatan students learn the value of service to others by volunteering in the classroom, on campus, and in the community.

Kensington’s full-day kindergartens provide the essential bridge from preschool to 1st grade. Our highly qualified teachers focus on building a strong foundation in core skills that will give children the academic confidence leading to future school success. With this as our goal, our teachers create classrooms of purposeful hands-on learning based on our accelerated program.

From the introduction of math concepts to a language arts program rich in phonics, reading strategies, and writing skills, Kensington is dedicated to developing confident, poised, life-long learners. Our students benefit from individualized teacher attention and an extended schedule that allows them ample time to reinforce new skills.

Kindergartners participate in educational field trips, school assemblies, and many creative art projects. Kensington’s monthly thematic units broaden student’s knowledge while reinforcing core skills. Working collaboratively as well as independently, they share and learn from each other. By communicating, sharing ideas and solving problems, students develop both intellectually and socially.

Kensington School believes connecting school learning with home learning is essential. Daily communication between parents and teachers enhances this connection. Teachers provide monthly homework calendars and invite family participation in the Book Buddy Reading Program and Words of the Week.

Smaller class size and the opportunity for individualized attention, combined with a proven curriculum and dedicated teachers, sets Kensington’s full-day kindergarten far above the academic standards of a traditional half-day program.

The original chapel built in 1792, burned in 1853. The second chapel, which included a balcony, was dismantled and used for firewood by Union troops during the Civil War. The third chapel was destroyed by fire. In 1869, Hickory Ground Methodist Episcopal Church had 24 members. In 1871, a tabernacle was built as a temporary worship place until a new church building was erected. A white frame church was completed in 1906. Stately oaks were planted in 1908 and dogwoods were planted by the W.P.A. in the early 1930’s. In 1948, classrooms, a fellowship hall, kitchen and furnace were added. A brick veneer was added to the exterior in 1952. In 1954, Hickory became a station church with one pastor. Prior to 1954, Hickory shared a pastor with seven other churches and later with three other churches. The sanctuary was completely remodeled with new pews, carpet and air conditioning in 1963. In 1968, the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church merged and we became Hickory United Methodist Church. In 1984, an air conditioning system was added to the Sunday school. In 1985, an 8:30 a.m. worship service was added. In 1986, the first “Good Neighbor Festival” was held. In 1988, a lighted sign was added to replace a smaller brick sign erected in 1970. A church steeple was erected in 1990. In 1993, a new fellowship hall, kitchen and restrooms were built. The old fellowship hall and kitchen were converted to classrooms. In 1998, a 9:50 a.m. contemporary worship service began as well as Wednesday night dinners and activities.  In March of 2000 the new social hall burned and was replaced in 2001 with a new multipurpose building.  This building was larger and had room for future growth.
