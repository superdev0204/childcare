I realized when I was pregnant with my second son, that not only did I want to be involved in every aspect of my children's lives, but that I wanted to give more children a safe and comfortable environment to grow and learn in. I changed my major from Radiologic Technology to Early Childhood Education and Development and graduated with an Associate's degree in the spring of 2013. As a preschool/childcare center, we do some curriculum-based learning, but much of the teaching we provide involves hand-on experiences. We love to take walks and play games. We have a fairly large playroom dedicated to the daycare, as well as the entire house for the children to learn and grow in. These are the grounds for which the business name, ""The Best of Both Worlds"" was chosen; children will be provided with a rich learning environment while in the loving comfort of a home."

I came from a family of twelve children. My husband and I are proud parents of four, with one daughter and three sons. Grandparents of six, two grandsons, and four granddaughters. We believe in early childhood intervention. A missed milestone can help you spot a potential for learning social or physical concerns. Giving you the opportunity to act accordingly to the child’s needs. As a new day care, we believe life is always about learning. As the children learn, so shall the providers. We will extend our education through HRDC Professional Development Program from beginner to intermediate and on to the 60 hour Montana Infant/Toddler Care Giver Education and the Montana Preschool Teacher Education. Because learning never ends."

We also have a large fenced back yard and field where we have a garden. In the yard there is a climber, and many ride toys. The children stay with me and we try to transition every hour or two according to the children's needs for that day. Toys activities and activities are set up with the children's interests and development level in mind. Toys are easily accessed and children are welcome to pull out bins and toys, and encouraged to put them away when they are finished playing with the item. We are on the food program, and try to provide healthy meals and snacks. I have been accredited for 9 years as well as have been a stars provider for 2 1/2 years.

All children learn best when they are provided a positive, caring, and supportive learning environment. Children learn best through hands on experiences that use all 5 senses and this is how we teach. We take into account the: Environmental qualities of our environment such as sound, light, temperature, and design. Emotional qualities of our environment such as motivation, persistence, quality, and structure. Sociological qualities of our environment such as self, pair, peers/team, adult and varied. Physical qualities of our environment such as perceptual, intake, time, and mobility. Psychological qualities of our environment such as global analytic, hemispheric, and impulsive/reflective. We also take some of our strategies from the emotional intelligence's theory when setting up our space and developing lesson plans. We plan and implement this way because as we all know all children learn differently and are unique... they don't fit into a box of sameness, and they shouldn't have to. That is why when we teach and create with children we foster and value each child's uniqueness and differences. Curriculum: Adventures in Learning has a preschool curriculum developed by Shauna and her years experience as an Elementary teacher, preschool teacher, and Head Start teacher as well as her collaborations with other teachers in the valley. We all want our children to succeed, to love school and to love learning..... at Adventures we do this by making learning and school fun and engaging. We want to prepare children for school but not create frustration and burn out. All of these things were in the forefront of our minds while creating our curriculum. For example: We will base our reading/phonics around Zoo Phonics. ""Zoo-phonics is a well-balanced curriculum and methodology spanning the entire language arts spectrum by teaching children systematic phonics, as well as rich literature and language development. Body movements hold the child's attention and cement the letter to the sound. Children manipulate the alphabet with their eyes, ears, and mouth, and bodies. Because the curriculum is so playful, children want to learn and enjoy it. The ""26 Animal Friends"" help children remember the shapes and sounds of the letters (allie alligator, bubba bear, catina cat, etc.). Instead of looking at an abstract symbol, they see a familiar animal, which keep students excited and focused in the classroom."" My Oldest daughter, Arianna had many speech issues entering kindergarten this last year and struggled immensely with reading.. but Zoo Phonics helped her so much! She would excitedly come home and tell me of the new character they learned for that week! I want this for YOUR children, this excitement, this joy and love for learning! This is why I chose Zoo Phonics for the basis of my reading/phonics curriculum! We have large group, small group, and individual instruction/interactions here at Adventures in Learning. We strive to give your child/ren the best preschool/childcare experience that they can have! We always encourage parents/guardians to be part of the learning for their child as well and love to have you check in with us whenever you get a chance! Remember: Learning is play and play is learning! Adventures in Learning is insured and licensed with the State of Montana. We participate in the U.S Dept. of Agriculture's Child and Adult Food Program (CACFP). Our participation in this program provides federal assistance toward the cost of serving nutritious meals and snacks to the children in our care. We accept Best Beginnings scholarships. We accept children aged 3-12."

The Little Spanish Preschool staff is committed to providing a loving and supportive environment for learning. Our curriculum is based on providing a fun and educational environment for preschool aged children with an emphasis on learning Spanish as a second language. Preschool is the perfect age to begin to learn a new language as the neuroplasticity of your child’s brain will make this a natural process. With a little help, they will LOVE it! With the right guidance, a child can become bilingual before he/she turns five. The best way to achieve this is by reading aloud, acting out stories, using fun arts projects, singing, and playing. Our learning materials and interactive approach will help your child learn Spanish the most efficient and fun way."

We provide care and education services for children 19 months through 12 years of age. The center is designed to provide a safe, loving, and enriching environment for children. We will focus on encouraging the development of each child through fun and age appropriate activities. We are dedicated to providing programs and activities that will target all areas of child development. Research has firmly demonstrated the importance of establishing a solid emotional, social, intellectual, and physical base during the child’s early years. We believe, and research has shown, that children learn best through PLAY! Children at our center will follow a flexible daily schedule that allows plenty of opportunities for learning through play, and that meets the individual needs of the children served by our program. The plan for development will allow for cultural, language and developmental differences to be addressed. There will be sufficient opportunity for indoor and outdoor physical activities, which will allow for fine and gross motor development. The schedule will include opportunity for problem-solving experiences that help to formulate language development and sensory discrimination. We offer a preschool program for children ages 3 to 5.  We use a constructive curriculum to encourage active participation and learning through play."
