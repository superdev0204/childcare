That's how the parent of one child sums up Tri-County Head Start. Our Federally funded program has helped more than 15,000 low income 3 to 4 year old children and families in Berrien, Cass and Van Buren counties learn and grow since 1970.

Tri-County Head Start helps families meet their children's educational, nutritional, health, social and emotional needs by providing a number of services in centers and homes by linking families with other service providers. Head Start programs are run by and for parents of the children that Head Start serves. Parents direct our policy, plan and budget. 

We assure children's participation in well child care, including physical and dental examination, and provide assistance in connecting parents with a continuing source of care for their child. Head Start children receive meals and snacks that meet a third of their daily nutritional needs. 

Head Start encourages children to expand language and thinking skills, develop small and large muscles, and learn socialization and cooperation. Our classrooms are interesting and creative places. They encourage learning through exploration of materials and interaction with other children and caring adults. Head Start meets the unique needs of every child through observation and recognition of the child's family and community culture. It prepares children for Kindergarten or as one parent describes it: ""My sons and daughter learned the joy of learning and the joy of school."" 

Tri-County Head Start is sponsored by the Tri-County Council for Child Development, a private non-profit corporation whose board includes county commissioners, community representatives and parents from Berrien, Cass and Van Buren counties.

Family eligibility is determined by federal income guidelines and is free to those who qualify.";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/centerinfo.html";;;"http://www.tricountyhs.org/employment.html";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/enrollment.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/tchs_banner.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/health.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/education.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/hearing_test.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/EHS_Services.jpg";;

The center is located on Monroe Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  This location is still serving families of Grand Rapids today.

Bridgett Tubbs-Carlon, AppleTree founder, opened this location with her husband Doug (1951 - 2007) with the dream of creating a premier child care and early education facility that not only was a safe environment for their daughter, Anna (pictured above), but also could exceed the expectations of the families it served.  Having her own daughter attend the school allowed Bridgett to continually monitor the curriculum and programs. 

This hands-on approach turned out to be highly advantageous and a definite plus in the eyes of parents.  From then on, it was decided that any and all AppleTree centers would be owner-operated.  Now 14 strong, AppleTree and its philosophy has given rise to a family of child care centers and celebrated 16 years of providing quality education and care in 2014.

Aa a Cooperative the parents and teacher work together for the education and maturation of the children. Currently, one teacher and two or three parents work during each class session with 20-24 children. Parents are scheduled to assist on a rotating basis and are given this schedule in advance.
Our goal is to promote the social, emotional, intellectual and physical development of the preschool child. We provide a safe and nurturing environment which allows children to grow at their own developmentally appropriate pace.

Thousands of escaping slaves undertook a year-long, clandestine journey through Tennessee, north through Indiana into Michigan and to the Detroit area (known as ""midnight""). Then, by riverboat, the travelers moved across the river to freedom in Ontario, Canada. These brave men and women followed the North Star during their journey to a better life.

One of the last stops was the Lerich family farm in Shelby Township.

The mission of Project FOCUS is to produce quality, motivated citizens through safe and fun educational enrichment opportunities that will broaden the horizons of both the students and their community.

Based on similar socioeconomic characteristics, the community learning centers are located in Hart Public Schools, Hesperia Community Schools (elementary and middle), Muskegon Heights Public Schools (elementary), Walkerville Community Schools, and White Cloud Public Schools (elementary and middle), and are for first through eighth grade students in those districts. Project FOCUS receives funding through a 21st Century Learning Center grant from the Michigan Department of Education.

Working together with the schools, Project FOCUS positively impacts families and helps to improve academic performance. The program offers age-specific and mixed group programming, cultural sensitivity, and mutual respect between children and staff. The overriding strength lies in our integration with each school’s curriculum, community, and a friendly learning atmosphere that takes each child’s interests and uniqueness into account.  If you have a student who attends school in one of our districts, falls within the grades noted, and would like to participate, please contact the specific school's site coordinator.

Program Goals

We believe that the education of your child should be the cooperative responsibility of his/her home and school. By working closely with you,
we will provide the consistency needed to develop security and independence in your child. We strive to provide a nurturing, stimulating
atmosphere in which your child will grow emotionally, socially, physically and creatively, as well as academically. Your child is in the process of
creating the adult he/she will become. Our program is devoted to encouraging the self-esteem, self-confidence and self-motivation necessary
for this growth.";"http://www.ortonvillemontessori.com/";;"5am-6:30pm";;;"http://www.ortonvillemontessori.com/handbook.html";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.ortonvillemontessori.com/files/IMG_0.jpg";"http://www.ortonvillemontessori.com/pics.html";;;;;

We seek to meet those needs in a positive, loving way that will enhance each child’s self-concept. 

Within this framework, each child will be helped to develop an increasing awareness of themselves and emotions and find acceptable outlets for them, to find satisfaction in a variety of activities, and to experience a sense of achievement in doing things appropriate for their age.

We desire to help meet the need for quality, loving care for your child, to provide an environment in which you can feel comfortable and secure leaving your child.

Now, only months away from celebrating Avila Child Care Center's twentieth anniversary, they have kept that promise. With a highly-trained, nurturing staff, Avila Child Care Center continues to be committed to providing a loving educational environment for children.      
     Embracing the nationally recognized HighScope curriculum, Avila Child Care Center continues to focus on nurturing creative and academic success. Through the use of daily art projects, group activity time, free-play, and courses on Spanish as a second language, Avila Child Care Center is dedicated to fostering well-rounded and independent thinkers.
     Family owned and operated, Avila Child Care Center is proudly rooted in the Chelsea Community. Marelvi and Fred's two sons, Frederik and Peter, attended Chelsea Public Schools and both parents were - and remain - actively involved in this community. For years, Marelvi was a member of the Pierce Lake Elementary PTO board, her focus always being on programs engineered to enrich the lives of Chelsea's children. Fred has played a crucial role in the development of the Chelsea Lacrosse program, and currently is the head coach of the newly-founded Beach Middle School Lacrosse team. Avila Child Care Center also offers internship opportunities for high school students interested in pursuing a career in Early Childhood Education through Chelsea High School's Cadet Teaching program. 
     Avila Child Care Center thrives because of their focus on meeting the needs of each individual child and their families.

Telamon operates three types of Head Start programs for disadvantaged families: Head Start (preschool for children ages 3 to 5 years old), Early Head Start (childcare for children 0 to 3 years old and pregnant women), and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (childcare and preschool for children of eligible farmworkers ages 0 to 5 years old). Children with disabilities are encouraged to participate in all programs. Telamon’s approach to Head Start services includes:

    A nurturing environment that supports the healthy growth and development of each child in the context of the child's family, culture, and community
    Parents as partners in the shared decision-making process and as active participants in policy groups; and
    Recognition of the importance of strengthening linkages within communities.


Our Head Start programs offer a variety of service models, depending on the needs of families in each community.  Head Start centers provide a secure setting where children can develop their skills under the watchful eyes of well-trained caregivers.  Partial or full-day services at centers include health and dental screenings, nutritious meals, individual as well as group learning experiences, play opportunities and other structured activities. All services and materials are designed to be age and developmentally appropriate as well as sensitive to the cultural and language environment of a child's home. Parents are included in program planning and oversight activities.

Some programs are based in the children’s own home, where staff visit once a week to provide services to the child and family. Children and families who receive these services gather periodically with other enrolled families for a group learning experience facilitated by Telamon staff.";"http://www.telamon.org/michigan-migrant-head-start.aspx";;;"https://www.vscyberhosting.com/telamon/";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.telamon.org/images/top/telamon-logo.png";;;;;;

    Writing.  Students learn about the writing process, content, style and grammar using research based methods.
    Reading. We use brain research to guide and inform our literacy decisions; our district-wide Rewiring the Brain program has received accolades from state organizations and continues to effectively teach early literacy skills and comprehension strategies.
    Math facts. We use best practices as well as differentiated instruction to address each student’s needs.  Additionally, we are using DELTA MATH screeners to assess each student’s progress and design specific interventions to meet their unique needs.

   The Dix Street team is dedicated to the students of Otsego, and I am continually amazed at the level of support from this community.

    - at Our Father’s Child, we are teachers who want to make the most of your child’s day and who want to make the most of their life.
    We believe:
    Children are treasures and must receive the patience and understanding from caregivers who are capable of providing this.
    Children should experience a variety of positive learning experiences so they grow independent with the world around them.
    Children play is essential to their physical development, as well as their social and cognitive growth Caregivers must educate themselves and guide children development.
    Children should be encouraged to discover what makes them special.
    Learning is accomplished in a setting that is emotionally secure, safe, and fun!";"http://www.ourfatherschild.com/";;"6:00 am to 6:00 pm Extended hours available until 8:00PM ";"http://www.ourfatherschild.com/careers/";;"http://www.ourfatherschild.com/about/";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

Our school offers small class sizes, a friendly atmosphere, but high expectations for all of our students.  Our graduates go on to very challenging programs in the state’s largest universities and achieve very well.  Some even have gone on to very demanding honors programs with high levels of success.  The secret to these students’ success stories comes from being very involved in all activities and programs we have to offer.  Our students also can be active in several sports and clubs that students in large schools often don’t.  This active life style creates a well-rounded individual who is confident in their self-image.  If this is what you hope for, then Colon Community Schools is just the place for you.

  We also offer parents a way to be involved with their children.  We encourage parental volunteers in our schools and if your work schedule keeps you busy then our Power School student information line keeps you up to date.  This allows you to check your child’s attendance and grades on a daily basis.  It also offers a quick way to send a teacher an e-mail to ask a question or offer suggestions on your child’s best learning style.

  Our computer labs are new and up to date to make sure your children receive the best technology to keep them up to speed with students from around the globe.  So if you are looking for a safe, educationally challenging, and opportunity rich school then, Colon Community Schools is the place for you.

Grants are provided to local public and private non-profit and for-profit agencies to provide comprehensive child development services to economically disadvantaged children and families, with a special focus on helping preschoolers develop the early reading and math skills they need to be successful in school. In FY 1995, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to three years of age in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children's growth and development.

     Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. They engage parents in their children's learning and help them in making progress toward their educational, literacy and employment goals.

The mission of Project FOCUS is to produce quality, motivated citizens through safe and fun educational enrichment opportunities that will broaden the horizons of both the students and their community.

Based on similar socioeconomic characteristics, the community learning centers are located in Hart Public Schools, Hesperia Community Schools (elementary and middle), Muskegon Heights Public Schools (elementary), Walkerville Community Schools, and White Cloud Public Schools (elementary and middle), and are for first through eighth grade students in those districts. Project FOCUS receives funding through a 21st Century Learning Center grant from the Michigan Department of Education.

Working together with the schools, Project FOCUS positively impacts families and helps to improve academic performance. The program offers age-specific and mixed group programming, cultural sensitivity, and mutual respect between children and staff. The overriding strength lies in our integration with each school’s curriculum, community, and a friendly learning atmosphere that takes each child’s interests and uniqueness into account.  If you have a student who attends school in one of our districts, falls within the grades noted, and would like to participate, please contact the specific school's site coordinator.

In his youth, he was a landscape gardener and planted many of the trees on Jefferson Avenue.  He studied law and became a Grosse Pointe Township Justice of the Peace in 1884.  He later served as President of Grosse Pointe Park Village from 1910-1912.  He served on the school board for 30 years even before the five Grosse Pointe School districts consolidated in 1922.  He made the necessary trips to Ypsilanti to select teachers for the schools as well as books and supplies.

In 1861, the School is listed as a frame school.  It was named District One and located on the north side of Jefferson on PC126/127 (where Balfour is today.) In 1868, the school is listed as a brick school.  This is probably when they moved the school across the street. In 1901, the third school was built on Beaconsfield (present Sunoco Station).  It was still referred to as the District One School.

The original Robert Trombly School was built in 1903 at the Corner of Jefferson and Beaconsfield.  A Sunoco gas station is located on the property now.  In 1925, the first PTA was formed and Mrs. Ethel Cowe was made acting principal.  In 1925, the School Board purchased the current sight of Trombly School, 5.24 acres, at a cost of $180,806.17.  The first phase of the building to the auditorium was completed in 1927, and the second wing was built in 1930 and gives us the school as we know it today.  The cost for the building and equipment was $423,301.16 and was considered an architectural masterpiece.

The first PTA meeting was held in February of 1927.  A short business meeting was held, followed by a musical presentation by the high school orchestra.  Everyone toured the new facility and ended the evening with dancing and refreshments in the gym.  There were five teachers including the principal.

Trombly has the only auditorium in the Grosse Pointe Elementary Schools which is frequently used for student assemblies, concerts and fine arts presentations.  Trombly's upstairs playroom became the current library in 1967, and is named the Frank C. Welcenbach Library Center honoring the school's second principal. Trombly School has a rich history.  The quality and dedication of the staff, as well as the active participation of parent volunteers make Trombly a very special school.";"http://gpschools.schoolwires.net/site/default.aspx?domainid=1900";"https://www.facebook.com/GPPSS";"8:00 am - 4:30 pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://gpschools.schoolwires.net/cms/lib05/mi01000971/centricity/template/globalassets/images///logos/trombly2.jpg";"http://gpschools.schoolwires.net/cms/lib05/MI01000971/Centricity/ModuleInstance/33098/large/Trombly%20Trot%202.jpg?rnd=0.846633311289657";"http://gpschools.schoolwires.net/cms/lib05/MI01000971/Centricity/ModuleInstance/33098/large/T%20Trot.jpg?rnd=0.812119844282102";"http://gpschools.schoolwires.net/cms/lib05/mi01000971/centricity/moduleinstance/33098/large/terrier%20trot%20cheerleaders.jpg?rnd=0.990854788567338";"http://gpschools.schoolwires.net/cms/lib05/mi01000971/centricity/moduleinstance/33098/large/thanks.jpg?rnd=0.430093322149521";;

The District responds to a community need for early childhood education and child care to meet the needs of working parents by providing before- and after-school child care (latchkey), a preschool program, extended care, and summer day camp.  Students who require special services are given individual instruction and attention through guidance and counseling programs, school social worker assistance, summer school and homebound, speech and language services, 504 plans, and other special education services. 
 
Because of the close-knit nature of the community, parents are very interested and very involved in what is taking place in the schools.  Parents demonstrate their support through positive communication with teachers in a wide variety of school events.  This involvement by parents, as well as staff, students, the Board of Education, and the entire community, helps make the Allen Park Public Schools an excellent place to learn, and the city of Allen Park an outstanding place to work and live.";"http://www.apps.k12.mi.us/schools/lindemann/";;"Student Hours

An exciting journey of learning and growth is in store for your child!  Developing each child's academic, emotional, and social potential is our focus.  All students' needs will be met using whole group, small group, and individual instruction.  Our goal is for your child to gain a solid academic foundation and independence through hands on, engaging learning activities.

Literacy skills are practiced daily in literacy stations, by engaging in read alouds, and participating in both Shared Reading as well as leveled Guided Reading.  Kindergartners learn to recognize and write many sight words.  A strong phonics program is embedded into all literacy areas.

Writer's Workshop is an important part of our day!  We begin by telling oral stories and learning to draw detailed pictures to represent a story.  As the year progresses, kindergartners write Concept books, Small Moment stores, How-To's, and Opinion pieces. 

Math instruction includes number sense to 100, fluent writing of numbers 0-30, and counting by 1's, 5's, and 10's to 100.  Kindergartners learn to recognize 3D shapes, use measurement tools, and become fluent in addition and subtraction facts through 5.  During our ""Math Mania"" time, children use manipulatives and games to apply new math concepts.

We enjoy playing outside at least 30 minutes daily.  Gross (large) and fine motor movement is is integrated into all parts of our curriculum and we use music to get us up and moving!  You'll find us developing oral language and social skills during Team Time, with free choice activities such as blocks, storytelling cottage, painting, play-doh, and board games.  A short rest time after lunch is incorporated into our schedule.  Kindergartners enjoy physical education, music, art, library, ipads, and computer lab throughout the week.  

We look forward to an exciting year of teaching and learning with your child!";"http://holly.hes.schoolfusion.us/";;"8:40 AM - 3:41 PM

So at Tutor Time, every child’s unique set of skills and interests are utilized to his or her advantage in the way that they learn, grow, build self-esteem, and develop their imagination.

It’s our job to bring out their best.

Your child’s day at Tutor Time is educational. It’s social. And it’s highly energetic. The secret ingredient is our LifeSmart™ curriculum, which creates fruitful, hands-on learning and confident self-expression. Inspired by Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory, LifeSmart recognizes and embraces the different strengths and abilities of individual children. Those differences are embraced and used to drive a customized early education that addresses the specific needs of your child.

Beyond their development and education, your child’s safety and security are our top priority. And communication is essential. With regular updates (including many photos) of your child’s experiences, you can feel comfortable that you are sharing this journey – every step of the way.

The center is located on Monroe Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  This location is still serving families of Grand Rapids today.

Bridgett Tubbs-Carlon, AppleTree founder, opened this location with her husband Doug (1951 - 2007) with the dream of creating a premier child care and early education facility that not only was a safe environment for their daughter, Anna (pictured above), but also could exceed the expectations of the families it served.  Having her own daughter attend the school allowed Bridgett to continually monitor the curriculum and programs. 

This hands-on approach turned out to be highly advantageous and a definite plus in the eyes of parents.  From then on, it was decided that any and all AppleTree centers would be owner-operated.  Now 14 strong, AppleTree and its philosophy has given rise to a family of child care centers and celebrated 16 years of providing quality education and care in 2014.

The mission of Project FOCUS is to produce quality, motivated citizens through safe and fun educational enrichment opportunities that will broaden the horizons of both the students and their community.

Based on similar socioeconomic characteristics, the community learning centers are located in Hart Public Schools, Hesperia Community Schools (elementary and middle), Muskegon Heights Public Schools (elementary), Walkerville Community Schools, and White Cloud Public Schools (elementary and middle), and are for first through eighth grade students in those districts. Project FOCUS receives funding through a 21st Century Learning Center grant from the Michigan Department of Education.

Working together with the schools, Project FOCUS positively impacts families and helps to improve academic performance. The program offers age-specific and mixed group programming, cultural sensitivity, and mutual respect between children and staff. The overriding strength lies in our integration with each school’s curriculum, community, and a friendly learning atmosphere that takes each child’s interests and uniqueness into account.  If you have a student who attends school in one of our districts, falls within the grades noted, and would like to participate, please contact the specific school's site coordinator.

Parents are actively involved by volunteering, attending relevant training and participating in the planning, budgeting and staff selection process.  Each child enrolled is assessed individually in both cognitive and emotional domains to foster the greatest possibility for later school success.  They also receive medical and dental services.

Joining a team is a commitment that is taken seriously. Students are expected to attend all games and practices. A student who quits the team after making the commitment to participate will not be eligible to play the next full season sport offered at school. Students may appeal this decision to the athletic director and principal if there is a special circumstance forcing them to quit.

Our joined voices are nonpartisan yet speak for our communities in support of our Mission.

Historically and through today, the YWCA provides programs and responds to difficult issues left unanswered by other social service organizations. For example, in the early 20th century we provided housing, educational and recreational opportunities for young women relocating to Detroit for employment opportunities and immigrant women arriving on our shores for new life opportunities.

A century later, we provide safe housing and counseling for women and children fleeing the horrors of abusive homes. We continue programs that enhance and support women as they assume leadership roles in all sectors of our society whether we are providing safe, quality, affordable childcare for working moms; counseling for survivors of domestic violence; or a special outdoor experience for children with disabilities, we are the YWCA of Metropolitan Detroit, and we are 110 years strong.";"http://www.ywcadetroit.org/our_programs/reggio/contact.html";"https://www.facebook.com/YWCAdetroit";;;"http://www.ywcadetroit.org/our_programs/reggio/reggio_regonline.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://cdn.firespring.com/images/74e49e54-ddef-4614-8c5a-23ce690c15fe.gif";;;;;;

The children met on a regular basis, rotating homes each week.  Soon other friends and neighbors became interested in joining and within one year the group had grown to nine mothers and twelve children, ages three and four.  This is where our school was birthed.

The nursery, named Drayton Plains Nursery, became licensed in 1963.  Due to the growing number of children on the waiting list, they decided to divide the children into two groups according to age.  The board saw a need to change locations from where they were and did so in the summer of 1973.  They not only began the 1973-1974 school year at a new location, but also with a new name, Creative Cooperative Nursery.  By 1986 the name was changed to Creative Cooperative Preschool to differentiate the program from other day care centers nurseries. 

Over the years, the school has been located in many church or community buildings including the Waterford C.A.I. building, Canterbury on the Lakes Health Care Center, Shepherd Fellowship Church, St. Stephen's school and have now found their home in Calvary Evangelical Lutheran Church.

We are a non-profit cooperative preschool. A co-op means we are owned and operated by the parents of the young children. A co-op is distinct because it involves parents working in the classroom, fundraising, and attending meetings to offset tuition while devoted to a child’s main business – playing.

In a co-op the staff includes a well trained teacher along with the parents.  Topsy Toddler costs less then other preschools because our parents contribute their time and talents to make our school successful. Parents are actively involved in every aspect of the school, in the classroom, on the board of directors and in various committees and jobs. 

Topsy Toddler's program creates a special community that gives parents and children the opportunity to play, learn and grow together.

Our children gain more one on one attention as there is normally one adult for every three students. The parents play an integral part in their child's education. Parental involvement is the key to a successful cooperative preschool.  

We offer a Tot class that is a NON POTTY TRAINED parent-toddler preschool class for 2 year olds. Tuition for the 2014-2015 year will be $35 a month.  

For FULLY POTTY TRAINED children, we  have a 3 year old class and a 4 year old class. Tuition for 3′s will be $55 per month, and tuition for 4′s will be $65 per month. Children must be 2, 3 or 4 respectively by October 1st, 2014 to enroll.  For more information click on the “Classes” button.

It plans to eliminate the traditional model in which students progress through school based on their age and “seat time,” or the required time a student must spend in a class to receive official credit for the class. Students will be organized by instructional levels based on completion of course content rather than by grade levels based on age. In other words, they will progress to the next level in school based on their mastery of content rather than the completion of a nine-month school year.

If a student can complete course work in six months, rather than nine, they will be advanced to the next level of course work.

If a student needs 10 months to complete course work, they will not be penalized because it takes them longer.

The EAA of Michigan will hire proven leaders and personnel to work in the schools that are brought under its jurisdiction. Principals will be empowered to assemble their staff, hire the best teachers and support them in a multitude of ways to improve individual student academic growth. The EAA of Michigan will direct 95 percent of the resources to the school classroom level.";"http://lawacademydetroit.weebly.com/contact.html";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Dr. Maria Montessori believed that a child learns best through self-motivation. An Italian physician and educator, she developed the Montessori philosophy and method of education in the early 1900s. She developed the theory that within each child there are ""sensitive periods""  when the child is most receptive to certain kinds of learning experiences. The prepared environment she designed is an ordered arrangement of learning materials in a non-competitive environment where each child develops at his own rate.

The center is located on Monroe Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  This location is still serving families of Grand Rapids today.

Bridgett Tubbs-Carlon, AppleTree founder, opened this location with her husband Doug (1951 - 2007) with the dream of creating a premier child care and early education facility that not only was a safe environment for their daughter, Anna (pictured above), but also could exceed the expectations of the families it served.  Having her own daughter attend the school allowed Bridgett to continually monitor the curriculum and programs. 

This hands-on approach turned out to be highly advantageous and a definite plus in the eyes of parents.  From then on, it was decided that any and all AppleTree centers would be owner-operated.  Now 14 strong, AppleTree and its philosophy has given rise to a family of child care centers and celebrated 16 years of providing quality education and care in 2014.

Our foundation is Jesus Christ.  The purpose of Rochester Hills Christian School is to educate and train a student physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually.  We believe that the Bible is the standard for truth; and, therefore, it is the basis of our education program for Sonshine academy's toddlers to our high school's twelfth graders. Our school's academic excellence is demonstrated by our students consistently scoring above the national average on the Stanford Achievement Test.

    Because the Lord requires a fit vessel, guidelines for personal habits, definite dress codes, and school standards are provided.  The student is also provided the opportunity to learn self-discipline and must honor the rights of others and respect their own freedom.  Not only must a young person have his appearance and actions reflecting the Lord Jesus, but he must also have biblical wisdom, knowledge and understanding to serve the Lord in the task He would choose.  We believe and practice the basic principles of educational excellence that have made America great.  We believe in patriotism and the free-enterprise system.

The mission of Project FOCUS is to produce quality, motivated citizens through safe and fun educational enrichment opportunities that will broaden the horizons of both the students and their community.

Based on similar socioeconomic characteristics, the community learning centers are located in Hart Public Schools, Hesperia Community Schools (elementary and middle), Muskegon Heights Public Schools (elementary), Walkerville Community Schools, and White Cloud Public Schools (elementary and middle), and are for first through eighth grade students in those districts. Project FOCUS receives funding through a 21st Century Learning Center grant from the Michigan Department of Education.

Working together with the schools, Project FOCUS positively impacts families and helps to improve academic performance. The program offers age-specific and mixed group programming, cultural sensitivity, and mutual respect between children and staff. The overriding strength lies in our integration with each school’s curriculum, community, and a friendly learning atmosphere that takes each child’s interests and uniqueness into account.  If you have a student who attends school in one of our districts, falls within the grades noted, and would like to participate, please contact the specific school's site coordinator.

These instruments include report cards, writing portfolios, teacher observations, parent teacher conferences and standardized test results.  Our teaching staff also prides itself with continually communicating to parents the successes and concerns of students attending our school .

    Hamilton-Parsons instructs students by using the Romeo Community Schools district wide core curriculum. This curriculum helps prepare students in their quest to be productive citizens in a continually changing society.

Bright Minds Childcare and Learning Center is like “traditional” preschool except our language of instruction is Spanish. Preschool is the best time in a persons life to learn a second language and immersion learning is the most effective way to achieve bilingualism. Students of Bright Minds learn how to communicate and perform academically in two languages before they enter Kindergarten. While the results are truly amazing, bilingualism offers and provides multiple benefits including; greater cognitive function, diversity in problem solving and higher levels of academic test scores than their monolingual peers.

Our preschool program is designed to encourage independence and a natural love for learning, both of which provide a strong base for a Preschool program.

WILLIS";"SALINE";"MI";48176;"WASHTENAW";"(734)429-2222";"http://jellybeandaycare.blogspot.com/";"jellybeanpreschool@gmail.com";"Jellybean uses a play based approach to curriculum.  Does this mean that all we do all day is play?  Well, yes and no.  Children learn so much through play.  Observations have shown that children learn by doing, so the more they get to “play” with things, the more they learn.  For example, a child may be “playing” in the block area with cars and ramps.  While this child is “playing”, he is also learning about physics when he sees how fast the cars go down different ramps, math when he counts how many cars are in the traffic jam, colors by sorting the cars into different colors, and problem solving by deciding how to build these ramps for the cars.  Teachers will ask open ended questions to observe what and how the child is learning and help them problem solve.  Teachers will use this information to expand on the child’s interest with cars and ramps and help them in area where they may need it.  Jellybean creates this atmosphere with 3 main components, the environment, interactions with teachers and children, and experiences.  Our environment is set up where children can make their own choices.  We have different interest areas that the children can go to freely where teachers provide different levels of challenges to meet children’s needs.  We have an outdoor environment as well where children can choose to go outside if that is where they want to learn where teachers will also have opportunities for learning.  We offer open snack so when children are hungry they can get their own snack and eat on their time.  There are only a few times a day when children are asked to come together, when it is time to be a group.  Which leads us to our second component, interaction with teachers and other children.  Interactions with teachers and children is also very important.  We will come together 2 times a day as a group to talk about numerous things.  This is a chance for children to be heard, whether it is to talk about what their plans are for the day or maybe do some problem solving.  We will also come together for lunch.  This is a time for children to learn important social skills like manners.  Teachers will be available to children all day when they need them.  It is important for the children to know that we support and respect them.  We want children to do the work that they find important not what the teacher directs them to do.  Teachers will intervene when they see that play has become unsafe, unfocused or destructive.  The experiences at Jellybean are so important to making a child feel special.  Children have teachers who create a nurturing environment for children to experience what they want.  The more hands on opportunities that children have the more they are learning.  Jellybean wants to provide the experiences that our children desire.  We want to nurture them so they can be all they can be.

Soon, the YMCA purchased a home on Maple Avenue to coordinate the activities of the association. A brand new state-of-the-art facility was built in 1955 at a cost of $1 million. Since then, the Birmingham Family YMCA served as a community centered for people of all ages and abilities. The Y campus became a key resource providing a safe and educational atmosphere where relationships developed, healthy activities conducted and family support services provided to the communities surrounding Birmingham.

At Kalamazoo Christian Elementary School, we provide a solid foundation for our students’ Christian faith as well as their academic growth. Through a curriculum that integrates God’s Word and teachings into all subjects and areas of life, students are taught that they have a special place in God’s kingdom. Meanwhile, a thorough academic program helps prepare students for the next stage in their educational journey.

Kalamazoo Christian Elementary School currently enrolls about 300 students in grade K – 4. Each student’s Christian education is enriched by the dedication of our talented staff along with parent involvement. KCES has developed a Parents and Educators in Partnership (PEP) program to organize and support school events and extracurricular activities that promote fellowship, fundraising and academic fun.

Each child is a special little human being with unique needs. Understanding and meeting those needs is of utmost importance to us. To accomplish this, it is imperative to work closely with parents in a complimentary manner.

We are dedicated to the goal of providing programs aimed at total child development. Research has firmly demonstrated the importance of establishing a solid emotional, social, intellectual and physical base during the child’s early years. Our curriculum is professionally designed to do this.

EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT is accomplished by nurturing children toward an inner sense of trust and autonomy. Our goal is the development of a positive self-image in order for the children to experience good feelings about themselves and their words.

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT is accomplished by helping children develop feelings of independence while being able to accept help and guidance from teachers and peers. Our goal is to guide children toward the development of self-control and the ability to participate with group members in a cooperative and satisfying manner. Emotional and social development are the foundation blocks that make it possiblefor children to utilize intellectual capacities.

INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT includes first-hand experiences in grasping appropriate concepts that enable children to think and reason as they face the challenges of each new task. Intelligence is measured by the number of ideas a child possesses.

PHYSICAL GROWTH is accomplished by the development of large and small muscles. An appropriately planned motor development program is provided.
Pumpkin Patch Child Care and Learning Center is dedicated to the concept of developing each child’s potential to the fullest.

“We are excited because our summer camp programs give children in our five-county region the opportunity to meet new children, keep active, and participate in a well-organized program,” says Warbler’s Nest director Lori White.  Last year, the camps averaged 25-30 children per week and White anticipates even more campers will participate this year.  The camps are held on Kirtland’s main campus near Roscommon and are staffed by Warbler’s Nest employees and are sometimes joined by other Kirtland faculty members with special skills or talents related to the camp’s weekly theme.";"http://www.kirtland.edu/warblers-nest-offers-summer-camps-for-kids.html";;;;"http://www.kirtland.edu/admissions";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

That's how the parent of one child sums up Tri-County Head Start. Our Federally funded program has helped more than 15,000 low income 3 to 4 year old children and families in Berrien, Cass and Van Buren counties learn and grow since 1970.

Tri-County Head Start helps families meet their children's educational, nutritional, health, social and emotional needs by providing a number of services in centers and homes by linking families with other service providers. Head Start programs are run by and for parents of the children that Head Start serves. Parents direct our policy, plan and budget. 

We assure children's participation in well child care, including physical and dental examination, and provide assistance in connecting parents with a continuing source of care for their child. Head Start children receive meals and snacks that meet a third of their daily nutritional needs. 

Head Start encourages children to expand language and thinking skills, develop small and large muscles, and learn socialization and cooperation. Our classrooms are interesting and creative places. They encourage learning through exploration of materials and interaction with other children and caring adults. Head Start meets the unique needs of every child through observation and recognition of the child's family and community culture. It prepares children for Kindergarten or as one parent describes it: ""My sons and daughter learned the joy of learning and the joy of school."" 

Tri-County Head Start is sponsored by the Tri-County Council for Child Development, a private non-profit corporation whose board includes county commissioners, community representatives and parents from Berrien, Cass and Van Buren counties.

Family eligibility is determined by federal income guidelines and is free to those who qualify.";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/centerinfo.html";;;"http://www.tricountyhs.org/employment.html";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/enrollment.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/tchs_banner.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/health.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/education.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/hearing_test.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/EHS_Services.jpg";;

St. Mary’s is a Catholic School located next to St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception Church in Niles Michigan. St. Mary’s School has as its foundation core Catholic values and proven curriculum trends in elementary education.  Today, the three R’s, reading, writing, and arithmetic, are uniquely blended with values of religion, respect, and responsibility.  Physical Education, Technology, Art, Music, and Spanish are offered to students as “specials”.

In a society in which mass media constantly inundates our children with the images of desire and materialism, we have a choice to provide our children with a safe haven of peace and moral stability.  St. Mary’s School is such a place!  Religion is an integral part of the daily curriculum at St. Mary’s. This enables our children to build a sense of accountability for their actions and a deep-seated compassion for others.

It’s our job to bring out their best.

Your child’s day at Tutor Time is educational. It’s social. And it’s highly energetic. The secret ingredient is our LifeSmart™ curriculum, which creates fruitful, hands-on learning and confident self-expression. Inspired by Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory, LifeSmart recognizes and embraces the different strengths and abilities of individual children. Those differences are embraced and used to drive a customized early education that addresses the specific needs of your child.

Beyond their development and education, your child’s safety and security are our top priority. And communication is essential. With regular updates (including many photos) of your child’s experiences, you can feel comfortable that you are sharing this journey – every step of the way.

Even starting at a very young age, children at our school are well prepared for each new step in their education and for every stage of their personal development.

In our Pre-K and Kindergarten classes children are encouraged to explore, imagine and create. They build social skills and personal confidence.

We encourage a collaborative environment where children, teachers, and parents can learn from each other and each individual is respected and valued.

Recognizing that children learn best by doing, our Reggio Emilia-inspired preschool classroom is a rich hands-on environment where children explore activity centers and develop emerging interests. As children progress in interest and ability, new academic concepts are introduced and some choices are more structured to gently guide students toward academic growth.

Within our daily routine, children plan their day to include a balance of activities, projects and play designed to be stimulating and enjoyable for children. Preschool should be a time when creativity and self-concept are nurtured, new ideas and concepts are introduced, and learning is an exciting and enriching adventure!

Our preschool teacher pays careful attention to the skills, knowledge and questions that each child brings to the classroom. Preschool students are introduced to letters, numbers, counting, music and writing using a variety of materials, subjects, and approaches.

Recognizing that preschool is a time of enormous social development, our teacher works to support each child’s social growth. With gentle guidance, children learn how to confidently and independently solve problems, to respect themselves and others, and to establish social relationships.";"http://branchlineschool.org/the-school/preschool/";"https://www.facebook.com/BranchLineSchool";"Mon - Fri:

Hour Kidz provides flexible full-time and part-time care for children ages six weeks to twelve years old. Drop-in care is also provided.

Those parents who work irregular hours will find ease and comfort in the times available and the drop off service.

The center provides transportation service to all South Lyon schools so that children can spend time before and after school in a safe and reliable environment.

We are proud and excited to be a part of this wonderful school district, and we are calling this program Bemis Farms 2.

Programs are located inside Model and Childs Elementary Schools.  Model, Bishop, and Brick Elementary students go to Model Elementary for Extended Care.

Our theme for Lincoln is ""Where Friends Meet Friends."" Our program provides a safe and friendly place where children can have the opportunity to relax and play with their friends after a long school day. Children learn many important social skills to succeed in life through play, and the Bemis Farms staff will help with conflict management skills, talking through problems, and using manners with friends - all important life skills for today and the future.

The children in the Bemis Farms Lincoln program have daily opportunities to engage in activities to help them both scholastically and socially. Teachers are available to help with homework, and all children will have the opportunity to play alone or in a group. Some of the favorite activities have been silent seatball, tag, fuse beads, large puzzles, science experiments, board and card games, sports, and art projects. Bemis Farms offers a variety of programs to meet your needs.  Meeting friends in a relaxed environment makes this program special.

Then, in 2003, we expanded to a 56-child daycare center near State Street in Ann Arbor.  Our family continued to grow and we found a new home in September 2012 at 850 S. Hewitt Rd, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197. We are now located behind Wendys and Tim Hortons in the 850 Hub Building, formerly the United Auto Workers (UAW) Child Family Center. 
 We share the building with several other community programs.  However, safety is still our highest priority! The inner entrance to Little Angels Preschool & Daycare is locked at all times and parents/guardians are given a pass code to get through the reinforced, security door.  All visitors must show ID and be registered to enter.  Additionally, our building is zoned in such a way that all of the other businesses must adhere to specific guidelines because they are in such close proximity to a child care.
L.A.P.D. also focuses on offering a clean and organized environment.  When you take a tour, we will show you the areas where all of your child's belongings, bottles, diapers, artwork, etc., will be located.  You will also see the detailed documents that we share with each parent. 
Our programs emphasize experience-based learning, supplemented with structured age-appropriate activities.

It requires the willingness to go above and beyond expectations. By doing so, a child has the opportunity to achieve the maximum quality of education. We believe the experiences children have are lasting impressions on their lives. Children need to experience positive and rewarding events to nurture their mental health. When a child is developing they also learn acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. To help children grasp the concept of acceptable and unacceptable behavior there has to be a standard of expectations in place. Acceptable behavior should be rewarded. When a child displays unacceptable behavior, redirection is more effective than punishment. It is important to understand that the foundation that children receive is what is instilled in them.

It is our responsibility as a child care professionals to identify specific needs of children. It is important to have good judgment and ethics when making assumptions about a child’s well-being. Communicating with parents is fundamental in providing support for the children and their families. The staff at Bundles of Blessings are obligated to continually be knowledgeable in all aspects of the needs of children. It is important to educate ourselves and be aware of the constant changes in research in regards to the care and needs of children.

Children learn best in a clean safe environment. Children need to know that they can trust the people and the things that are in their environment. The equipment and materials provided in their class needs to be clean, safe and developmentally appropriate. Learning materials need to be easily accessible and available for them to explore. It is also important that children learn life skills such as how to share, how to problem solve and how to manage emotions in order to develop into an upstanding, well-rounded adult member to society.

Bundles of Blessings Child Care has an open door policy. Parents are welcome at any time to come in and evaluate their child’s daily experience.";"http://bundlesofblessings.cc/";"https://www.facebook.com/bobchildcare";"6:00 am - 6:00 pm";;"http://bundlesofblessings.cc/about-us/admission-procedure/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://bundlesofblessings.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-BOB_Header-01.png";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10653877_10152801488760798_598090320358172264_n.jpg?oh=271cefcea233c5930a3dfa9fa50cb5fc&oe=54D71E87&__gda__=1427944895_f90960b6533c76df0ee197ca93cbb4dc";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10613078_10152788413925798_6381119665052411168_n.jpg?oh=f288d1de58ec0840416142cd14631960&oe=54D89163&__gda__=1427205493_b8687b48e74193bd8ccb05c5a79e0c1e";"https://scontent-a-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10427319_10152801489020798_6317856460242189722_n.jpg?oh=07a5d7b691a3ce9808c00b9efe8860e5&oe=551E5496";"https://scontent-a-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/7091_10152786805390798_6079280042335928661_n.jpg?oh=03d6f9498fe17d7316cb8690ceb7c1cd&oe=551A30C4";;

They need indoor and outdoor space and a balance between active and quiet play. Our preschool program engages children in developmentally appropriate activities which are aimed at the development of the whole child. Through our play- based, thematic curriculum and creative exploration activities we are able to support each child’s cognitive, physical, emotional and social growth. Our program incorporates high academics and character education as well as social and environmental awareness, while emphasizing earth–friendly practices and other healthy choices. In this learning environment children are able to learn, explore, discover and meet their full potential as they experience the world around them.

We value diversity and we strive to foster individuality, self-confidence, a positive attitude, respect, responsibility to one’s self and to others and most importantly, a love of learning. Our teachers are teaching the next generation of lifelong learners and preparing the children for future success in kindergarten and beyond.";"https://sites.google.com/site/explorationspreschool1/about-us";;"8:45am-3:45pm";;"https://sites.google.com/site/explorationspreschool1/forms";"https://sites.google.com/site/explorationspreschool1/forms";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"https://sites.google.com/site/explorationspreschool1/_/rsrc/1368154911189/config/customLogo.gif?revision=6";"https://sites.google.com/site/explorationspreschool1/_/rsrc/1369884631398/photos/IMG_3082_b.jpg?height=266&width=400";"https://78328425-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/explorationspreschool1/photos/IMG_3090_a.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7crj0eDQZQ7wldgAiU75OvZnnOYktTQ72EHgWoMuAOQs9d53vXNVdaQeLxKPUig7QVyi8kQpVO23IFKX6S4t1wDszjI9jXdaRFKbgbVrqDAvGYb8lITJ3BlNQH4_ARXnoorUt8-b4mbxY1aXMC7jOsA5SP6t5xDHyssgUa-AoMc5eAOkVmCVAZ8pyMdlLOX8c10jDzdSlbcDqsBiJRaE7v5Dgd2ohR88hatrbk_ZZbolFxgJXJs%3D&attredirects=0";"https://sites.google.com/site/explorationspreschool1/_/rsrc/1369890271865/photos/explorations%20BUC%20exterior%20shot%20to%20playground%20edited.jpg?height=245&width=400";"https://78328425-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/explorationspreschool1/photos/Making%20cookies.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7cpeFd6eDYG4N5NuWyjgKv9Y_jFnyKqLQ6CNCdIMzaYXYkwK_VPfhIA4ZgWvmB1QHfr56WdVczy7AJ4Lv4W83_eVeORbW09Tzt-0HfJJCUOr8Sp99qo0q-b4NRXgTp-Qsvvik0DanowbPXAqWFelyVblGFNoBiNAOy4D8XAp_6D-eXrdx1LlKGk2dePiQ5RXr8OXtnW3jKK7mqFxNWc8b6fKpi3ShdKZcvQLnYO-NJMkFEnyEiz9lXTsfunHrN0nEVwMcO7A&attredirects=0";;

We have been recognized by the Michigan Department of Education as a MICHIGAN REWARD SCHOOL - with high quality academics, enrichment, athletics and so much more! Caring, highly-qualified teachers provide every child with learning opportunities that utilize the entire community as the classroom. 
We feature a state-of-the-art computer lab as well as free after-school enrichment, including science exploration, mentoring and tutoring, character education, math and money, and reading with a purpose. Northridge Academy is a learning community that places strong emphasis on teaching and learning while maintaining interest in the development of each child individually. This emphasis focuses on employing best practices to influence higher student achievement that is sustainable. As a community of educators, our discovery is that our success with student attention and retention is derived as a result of adopting a constructivist method of teaching and learning. This ensures that we guide students rather than lecture to them, which allows them to develop and utilize higher order thinking skills and abilities to draw their own conclusions.
Further, students take ownership and experience feelings of self-worth, independence, and ability. Students actually take ownership of their own learning and development. The result is increased attention and retention, thereby sustained increased student achievement.

Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. Programs actively engage parents in their children's learning and help them in making progress toward their educational, literacy and employment goals. Significant emphasis is placed on the involvement of parents in the administration of local Head Start programs.

Early Head Start, launched in 1995, provides support to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families. EHS programs enhance children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development; assist pregnant women to access comprehensive prenatal and postpartum care; support parents' efforts to fulfill their parental roles; and help parents move toward self-sufficiency.

Dedicated Christian parents and members of our congregation worked hard to start our Lutheran elementary school in 1976. Since then we have continued to teach God's truths to His precious lambs. Our school has a wonderful family atmosphere, and many parents and church members volunteer their time to help at school in many ways.

Our graduates do very well in high school and beyond.

We strive, at New Wonders Discovery Center, to provide a high-quality childcare and educational program where young children are encouraged to explore, discover, and celebrate learning in a safe and caring environment.

We believe that each child is a special and unique individual with great value. We offer an environment that enables children to build self-confidence and independence, while at the same time, learning to respect the rights of others. Understanding that ""play"" is the work of young children, we will offer teacher directed and child guided age-appropriate activities in physical, cognitive, social-emotional, and language development while promoting skills in literacy, math, science, and social studies. 

Our staff will care for and act with knowledge and purpose so that young children will acquire the skills they need to succeed not only in school, but in life. Teachers will take advantage of and support child-guided experiences and promote learning opportunities.

We understand that parents are the most important people in a child's life and our staff endeavors to provide a compassionate and nurturing extension of the family.";"http://www.newwondersdc.com/";;"Monday- Friday

We are proud to be a small, rural school in the Magic Capital of the World.  Our school offers small class sizes, a friendly atmosphere, but high expectations for all of our students.  Our graduates go on to very challenging programs in the state’s largest universities and achieve very well.  Some even have gone on to very demanding honors programs with high levels of success.  The secret to these students’ success stories comes from being very involved in all activities and programs we have to offer.  Our students also can be active in several sports and clubs that students in large schools often don’t.  This active life style creates a well-rounded individual who is confident in their self-image.  If this is what you hope for, then Colon Community Schools is just the place for you.

  We also offer parents a way to be involved with their children.  We encourage parental volunteers in our schools and if your work schedule keeps you busy then our Power School student information line keeps you up to date.  This allows you to check your child’s attendance and grades on a daily basis.  It also offers a quick way to send a teacher an e-mail to ask a question or offer suggestions on your child’s best learning style.

  Our computer labs are new and up to date to make sure your children receive the best technology to keep them up to speed with students from around the globe.  So if you are looking for a safe, educationally challenging, and opportunity rich school then, Colon Community Schools is the place for you.

We assure children's participation in well child care, including physical and dental examination, and provide assistance in connecting parents with a continuing source of care for their child. Head Start children receive meals and snacks that meet a third of their daily nutritional needs. 

Head Start encourages children to expand language and thinking skills, develop small and large muscles, and learn socialization and cooperation. Our classrooms are interesting and creative places. They encourage learning through exploration of materials and interaction with other children and caring adults. Head Start meets the unique needs of every child through observation and recognition of the child's family and community culture. It prepares children for Kindergarten or as one parent describes it: ""My sons and daughter learned the joy of learning and the joy of school."" 

Tri-County Head Start is sponsored by the Tri-County Council for Child Development, a private non-profit corporation whose board includes county commissioners, community representatives and parents from Berrien, Cass and Van Buren counties.

Family eligibility is determined by federal income guidelines and is free to those who qualify.";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/centerinfo.html";;;"http://www.tricountyhs.org/employment.html";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/enrollment.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/tchs_banner.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/health.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/education.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/hearing_test.jpg";"http://www.tricountyhs.org/images/EHS_Services.jpg";;

We approach the education of a child as an integration of body, mind, and spirit. We allow exploration and discovery, encourage independence and concentration, and model respect of self, others, and environment.
Vision Statement
Our purpose is to offer an atmosphere where children feel inspired and compelled to learn by choosing activities that are interesting yet stimulating. We hope for children to learn through doing and to develop  a self-motivation through small successes along with a hunger to seek greater challenges. We will strive to help all children reveal their innate interests and strengths and to support them as they grow into the persons they were born to become. We realize the importance of the development of the spirit of each child and will encourage all to respect that spirit in themselves and others.";"http://weewings.org/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/WeeWingsMontessori";"Mon - Fri:

The center is located on Monroe Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  This location is still serving families of Grand Rapids today.

Bridgett Tubbs-Carlon, AppleTree founder, opened this location with her husband Doug (1951 - 2007) with the dream of creating a premier child care and early education facility that not only was a safe environment for their daughter, Anna (pictured above), but also could exceed the expectations of the families it served.  Having her own daughter attend the school allowed Bridgett to continually monitor the curriculum and programs. 

This hands-on approach turned out to be highly advantageous and a definite plus in the eyes of parents.  From then on, it was decided that any and all AppleTree centers would be owner-operated.  Now 14 strong, AppleTree and its philosophy has given rise to a family of child care centers and celebrated 16 years of providing quality education and care in 2014.

The school is located in Wyoming and housed on the campus of Holy Name of Jesus Parish. 
With the support of the Bishop, San Juan Diego Academy opened its doors in August 2011 through the collaboration, financial investment and shared vision of six parishes: the Cathedral of St. Andrew, Holy Name of Jesus, St. Joseph the Worker, St. Francis Xavier/Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Sorrow and St. Mary.
This initiative was inspired in part by research conducted by the University of Notre Dame which suggests that Latino children who attend Catholic school are 42% more likely to graduate from high school and more likely to graduate from college than their peers who attend public school. With only 50% of Latino students in Michigan graduating from high school each year, the goal of San Juan Diego Academy is to improve the educational outcomes for Latino children in our city.

Our small class sizes, friendly and inviting atmosphere, and a dedicated staff is what truly makes Rudyard a special place to learn.

Our extensive curricular offerings rival the offerings of much larger schools, without losing that small school feel.  Teachers get to know all of their students and build on that relationship with their students throughout the entire year.  Academic rigor is stressed in all coursework, as well as preparations for the future ahead of us.

I truly believe in the quality of the educational program at Rudyard.  If you are looking for the individualization and collaboration between yourself and the public school, look no further than RAS.

I welcome the opportunity to work with you and assist you in developing the best educational program for your student.  Please feel free to contact me at 906-478-3771.
