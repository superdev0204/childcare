The Early Intervention program is funded through the Alabama Department of Rehabilitative Services and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Most children grow and learn at a similar pace. If a child is not developing at or about the same rate as other children, that child may be experiencing a developmental delay. Early Intervention works to identify the special needs of a child and coordinates an individualized plan of services. All Early Intervention services and therapies are provided in the child's natural environment i.e., the child's home, daycare setting, etc. CSP's Early Intervention service coordinators will work with the family to determine the best setting. Family involvement is crucial to case management of these children. If a child is eligible for Early Intervention services, an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) is developed by the parents, the child's service coordinator and other service providers. An IFSP describes the services to be provided for a child including the frequency, time and location. The plan includes functional outcomes that will help a child reach full potential. The IFSP also plans for subsequent services, if needed, for when the child reaches age three.;http://www.cspwal.com/education-locations.aspx;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Community-Service-Programs-of-West-Alabama/178421844375?ref=ts;"Mon - Thu:

They live with their children, and truly love calling Alabama home. As parents highly involved in their children’s growth and developmental years of life, they decided to open a safe and love center so all children can learn and grow with them. Love and patience is something that they foster everyday as they are in the center daily for more than the average provider. They truly have the heart of mothers care for others and this is a gift that they feel was given to them from God.";http://journeyoflove24hrchildcare.com/about-us/;;;http://journeyoflove24hrchildcare.com/careers/;http://journeyoflove24hrchildcare.com/enrollment-inquiry/;;y;y;y;y;y;y;http://journeyoflove24hrchildcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/logo4.png;;;;;;

The A Beka curriculum is a Christian reading readiness program published by the Pensacola Christian School in Pensacola, Florida. This program is used as a basis for our curriculum here at Holt Street. The Holt Street Memorial Baptist Church Academy provides quality childcare to member and nonmember families to reduce the conflict between parental responsibilities and daily work requirements.

The Academy is offered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the family as the primary agent for the care and development of the child. The Academy program operation is developmental in nature and staffed with professionally qualified child development management personnel and care-giving adults.

Our program strives to provide a high quality educational program which is both child centered and developmentally appropriate. Our focus is to provide a safe, secure, nurturing environment, which fosters the spiritual, social, emotional, physical and cognitive growth of each child.

We will expose your child to a well-rounded introduction to various fields of study such as art, reading, music, phonics, writing, history. Literature, science, math, vocal expression, Bible stories, manners and gross and fine motor skills. Enrichment activities in the form of field trips will be offered to provide additional learning.

We believe that experiences offered during the early years of a child’s life provide a solid foundation that will be beneficial at each stage of development in life.";http://www.holtstreetmemorialbaptistchurch.net/index.php/child-development-center-academy;;"Monday through Friday

The bible informs us the “the fear of the Lord” is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom (Proverbs 1:7, 9:10).  Therefore, any meaningful education that is truly valid must have a “reverence of God” as its starting point.

We want to meet the academic, spiritual, emotional, and social needs of each student in a Christ-centered environment.  We believe that our school has been called to meet the needs of students in an environment that puts its values on biblical principals.  We are called to minister to and to meet the needs of the Cathedral Academy learner.  We believe that this can only be accomplished by working with the home and the church.  A true and valid education can only come about through the cooperation of the home, church, and school.

We believe that part of loving God with all of our heart, mind, body, and soul entails delivering purposeful teaching that provides order, discipline, and structure (Luke 10:27).  Students are taught to develop and utilize critical thinking skills and are challenged daily by inspiring and dynamic curriculum.

The Early Intervention program is funded through the Alabama Department of Rehabilitative Services and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Most children grow and learn at a similar pace. If a child is not developing at or about the same rate as other children, that child may be experiencing a developmental delay. Early Intervention works to identify the special needs of a child and coordinates an individualized plan of services. All Early Intervention services and therapies are provided in the child's natural environment i.e., the child's home, daycare setting, etc. CSP's Early Intervention service coordinators will work with the family to determine the best setting. Family involvement is crucial to case management of these children. If a child is eligible for Early Intervention services, an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) is developed by the parents, the child's service coordinator and other service providers. An IFSP describes the services to be provided for a child including the frequency, time and location. The plan includes functional outcomes that will help a child reach full potential. The IFSP also plans for subsequent services, if needed, for when the child reaches age three.;http://www.cspwal.com/education-locations.aspx;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Community-Service-Programs-of-West-Alabama/178421844375?ref=ts;"Mon - Thu:

Our goal at Discovery Days Preschool is to nourish and encourage your children as they grow and discover the world around them.;http://www.discoveryumc.org/;;;;http://media.wix.com/ugd/673c99_ad048ece575349cda6610c7cf5481f60.pdf;;n;n;y;y;n;n;;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/673c99_36ad0c0c9860f2f9ffc826c64467b0db.jpg_srb_p_600_587_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/673c99_1eea05fe78f3461d684f9d381506c3c2.jpg_srb_p_600_587_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/673c99_495fe55c182b9adcd77fa8e2eea88fc2.jpg_srb_p_600_228_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/673c99_f556b4e9bcf033ff71a85b80435cb0fe.jpg_srb_p_644_495_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;;

So consider yourself invited. It is our hope and prayer that once you have looked at our Web-Site, we as the body of Christ have in some way touched a place within your heart that draws you to visit with us.
     If you do not already attend a Church, I'd like to take  this opportunity to invite you to visit with us here at Alexandria Valley Church of God anytime.
     We are always seeking people who desire a relationship with Jesus Christ. Being involved in an active church is pleasing to God.  One of the reasons we need to be part of a church is so that we can have accountability one to another. The Bible says that it is not good to walk alone,  but that “a threefold cord is not quickly broken” (Eccl 4:12). Fellowship is  necessary for the spiritual health of a Christian.
     So from the Pastor on down we want to take this opportunity to encourage you to visit with us, check out our Service Schedule tab for service times. We look forward to seeing you.";http://www.avcog.com/;https://www.facebook.com/avcog/info?tab=page_info;"Sunday School at 10:00 AM

679788;APOSTOLIC CHRISTIAN CHURCH - ATHENS;15284 HASTINGS ROAD;ATHENS;AL;35613;LIMESTONE;(256)233-0591;http://www.cvemx.org/;cvemexico@gmail.com;"A Christian Children’s home is a wonderful opportunity for relief and mission work as an outreach for lost souls. Due to the prevalence of shallow religions, mysticism and apathy in Mexico, there are many souls in need of a sincere, true and saving faith. A Children’s Home offers many opportunities to minister to children in need, parents or relatives of the children, employees of the children’s home, neighbors, friends and the community. A children’s home in Mexico offers team opportunities for church members and friends in a safe environment that our church controls. It provides short and long-term mission opportunities for Mexican and American brothers and sisters, and many work team construction opportunities.

In October 2003, a 25 acre property just south of Magdalena Mexico became available.  That property is now known as Casa Vida y Esperanza (CVE). Several brothers from the Apostolic Christian Church visited the area and felt God’s hand directing them and opening the way toward the purchase of that specific property with plans in mind to build an orphanage under the direction of the Apostolic Christian Church.

After much prayer and discussion regarding the purchase of this property, a non-profit corporation in which the title of the property would be held was formed. At the same time as the corporation was formed in Mexico, a U.S. non-profit organization was also formed, entitled “The House of Life and Hope” (the English equivalent of “Casa Vida y Esperanza”). A group of elder brothers set up a feasibility group to look into the proposed project more thoroughly, and set up the first House of Life and Hope board of directors.

The church officially purchased the property on August 16, 2004. The property contained a large main house and several buildings, although most were in disrepair. A tremendous amount of cleaning, repairs, additions and remodeling by staff and work teams allowed CVE to receive the first children in February 2005. Today the orphanage has more than 20 children and a team of staff members that care for the children, serve the needs of the church and community, and hosts fifteen plus work teams each year. CVE is in the process of building additional housing for children and staff.

The Lord has shown His guiding hand and amazing love for this work and this community. Prayerfully, with the support of the Apostolic Christian Church and prayers from each of you, CVE will continue to grow and expand under His direction.

Our goal is to provide a quality instructional program with high expectations for all students, staff, and administrators. We believe that education is a cooperative effort between the home, school and community that nurtures a child's complete development.

We believe that kindergarten should provide a learning environment that is meaningful for children by integrating subject matter into units of study that begin with the development of the child's understanding of the world around him or her. Learning is directly related to the child's everyday surroundings in an environment rich with literature and print.

The planned outcome of our program is that every student will leave kindergarten with the skills necessary to progress in the future and a lifelong love of learning.";http://bsl.albertk12.org/;;;;;http://bsl.albertk12.org/?PageName=%27Handbook%27;n;n;y;y;y;y;;http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_5426/f1e4194ebefb4e4a66f89fed85d71425.jpg;http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_5426/cb13f41ab820258b9b2786dbf266e142.jpg;http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_5426/79cc47558b2a2243ec0907d15f53b6c6.jpg;http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_5426/0fbff5a14a7647c1aae349ef02f0a302.jpg;;

    We believe the Bible to be the inspired and onty infallibly authoritative, inerrant word of God (II Timothy 3:16. II Peter 1:21).

    We believe that there is only one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Genesis 1:1, John 1:1, John 10:30, John 10: 37,38).

    We believe in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ to pay for our sins, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23, Luke 1:35; Hebrews 4:15/7:25. John 2:11; Hebrews 9:12; Colossians 1:14; John 11:25; Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11-16).

    We believe that man is sinful by nature and that regeneration by the Holy Spirit is essential and an absolute necessity for salvation. (Romans 3:19, 23; John 3:16-19; John 5:24; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5,6).

    We believe in the continuing ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose dwelling, the Christian is enabled to live a godly life (Ephesians 5:13, 4:30; I Corinthians 3:16, 6:19- 20)

    We believe in the resurrection of both the saved, and the lost; they who are saved unto eternal life and they who are lost unto eternal damnation (John 5:28,29).

    We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord, (Romans 8:9; I Corinthians 12:12-13; Galatians 3:26-28. 

    We believe that God is the Creator of all things and that man is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:1; Colossians 1:16-17; Genesis 1:26-28; Genesis 5:1-2).

Convenient to both downtown Birmingham and over-the-mountain suburbs, CMS offers its students an unparalleled private school education in a warm and loving atmosphere where the focus is on the individual child. Loving Learning, Growing Leaders, Teaching Excellence 

These are the cornerstones of the CMS experience. The Montessori teaching method, coupled with our highly trained teachers, allow students to grow into confident and enthusiastic learners.

Beginning in our toddler classrooms, the child begins to develop coordination, concentration, and independence while realizing that learning is an exciting process of discovery.  By graduation, our sixth-graders have grown into natural leaders, taking pride in their education and developing skills such as self-discipline, motivation, and confidence.

For our faculty, teaching isn’t just a job–it’s a calling. Teachers that choose to go through the extensive training process to become a certified Montessori teacher do so because they are passionate about their work. This passion translates into enthusiasm in the classroom and creates an inspiring environment for learners.

At CMS, the student-teacher ratio is also significantly higher than at comparable institutions. Our student-teacher ratios are minimally 5-1 for toddlers, 11-1 for preschoolers, and 16-1 for elementary students.  CMS also has an active parent-led organization called the Community Alliance which allows parents to develop a strong sense of partnership and community within the CMS family.

After graduation many of our students attend local private schools such as The Altamont School and Indian Springs School as well as public middle schools and the Alabama School of Fine Arts.";http://cmskids.org/;;;http://cmskids.org/about-us/job-opportunities/;http://cmskids.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2015/01/2015-2016-Enrollment-Application.pdf;;n;y;y;y;y;y;;http://cmskids.org/wp-content/gallery/archive/DSC_7509_3592.jpg;http://cmskids.org/wp-content/gallery/archive/DSC_7482_3565.jpg;http://cmskids.org/wp-content/gallery/archive/DSC_7481_3564.jpg;http://cmskids.org/wp-content/gallery/archive/DSC_7492_3575.jpg;;

Our purpose then and still today is to be the foremost parenting source in the area. 

Parenting is hard work.  At every stage of your child's growth towards becoming an adult there are unique challenges.  There are also challenges that you face in your role of managing your home and work outside of the home.  When all of these are combined it can leave moms and dads pretty worn out.

Yet, parenting is also one of the greatest blessings any one of us will experience.  Parents and their children together produce amazing love and laughter, life-long memories, and offer each other the support and encouragement of a ""Home.""

Eastern Shore Parents aims to come alongside you every month to spur you on in this journey by sharing practical and insightful stories from local and national writers including Dave Ramsey and John Rosemond.  We also showcase hundreds of local students every year and our event calendar covers everything promoted in the area for families.  These are just a few of the ways we support your family.

Forasmuch as ye know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition by your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.

Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen and a publican.

Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering: (for he is faithful that promised), And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. Jesus said in his word, “And, behold, I come quickly and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.” Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city";http://www.redeemedmobile.org/index.php?p=1_11_Pastor-s-Page;;;;;;not mentioned ;not mentioned ;not mentioned ;not mentioned ;not mentioned ;not mentioned ;;http://www.redeemedmobile.org/modules/gallery/albums/New_Orleans__Louisiana__Audubon_Zoo___Aquarium/img/130822075305__5.jpg;http://www.redeemedmobile.org/modules/gallery/albums/New_Orleans__Louisiana__Audubon_Zoo___Aquarium/img/130822075304__2.jpg;http://www.redeemedmobile.org/modules/gallery/albums/New_Orleans__Louisiana__Audubon_Zoo___Aquarium/img/130822075305__3.jpg;http://www.redeemedmobile.org/modules/gallery/albums/New_Orleans__Louisiana__Audubon_Zoo___Aquarium/img/130822075305_rcc_new_orleans.jpg;;

The highest form of education is found in the Word of the Living God, and a correct knowledge of the Scriptures lies at the foundation of all true education. The precepts and principles of religion are the first steps in the acquisition of knowledge.

Education must include the communion of the mind of man with the mind of God. This communion should lead to the acceptance, in sentiment and principle of the teachings of Jesus Christ. The principles of education given by Jesus are the only safe guide. When the great truths of God's Word are believed and received and carried into the life practice, education of the highest order results.

True education is the harmonious development of the physical, the mental and the spiritual powers. It embraces physical, mental and moral training in order that the powers shall be fitted for the best development to do service for God, and to work for the uplifting of humanity. Education comprises more than a knowledge of books, and will be of little value if there is no physical strength to use it after it is gained. A knowledge of labor for practical life is essential. Heart education is most important. Moral, intellectual, physical and social training should be combined to have well-developed, well-balanced boys and girls and young men and women.";http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/;;;;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/article/7/registration;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/article/6/handbook;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/theme/current/asset/asc/logo.png;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/site/1/carousel/01.jpg;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/site/1/carousel/exercise.jpg;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/site/1/carousel/class.jpg;http://ephesus23.adventistschoolconnect.org/site/1/carousel/EA%20Christmas%20Program%202014.jpg;;

    in families! We welcome families into our center. Family involvement is always important for children, but especially so during the early years.  We want you to be a part of your child’s early school experiences and encourage you to visit and participate in your child’s day. Our commitment to families includes providing opportunities for family fun and engagement.  We pledge to partner with you on the wonderful journey of childhood.
     each child is a gift from God! Every child is individual and develops at his or her own pace. Our goal is to welcome your child and provide opportunities for growth in all aspects of development. From social to spiritual growth, from cognitive to physical, we provide developmentally appropriate activities and guidance that allow individual differences to blossom.
    in play! Play is an important aspect of early childhood. Children learn through play. Play not only provides children with opportunities for social growth, but also cognitive growth. Our day is structured to provide a variety of activities, including play, that encourage children’s development.

Parents benefit from having an uninterrupted period of worship. Children are able to have a time to worship with peers and be taught with a curriculum at their level of understanding.
 
Young children sleep or play during regular worship services. An unfortunate result for some young people is that they learn to tune the sermons out. We realize that we must do more for our children so that they may be involved in worship. A separate children's worship service for children ages 4-12 years is beneficial in the following aspects:

    It allows children to learn in an age-appropriate setting with curriculum designed to serve them.
    Children become accustomed to praying in front of others.
    Adults have uninterrupted worship time.
    Children learn that church has some exceptionally kind adults who are eager to serve the youth.

Other points to remember:

    Even with limited space, a children's worship service can be instituted.
    A curriculum that includes hands-on biblically based activities helps create a fertile learning environment.
    Music is a necessary aspect of meaningful children's worship.
    A nursery and preschool accommodate both the children's and parent's worship needs.

Our focus is to offer a developmentally appropriate curriculum , The Creative Curriculum ,  and stimulating learning environment for your child.
 
In 1989 First Church Birmingham opened the Early Learning Center. The Center cares for children from infancy through five years old. In order to insure that the highest quality of care would always be offered, the Early Learning Center (or ELC) voluntarily applied for accreditation by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). After the ELC was visited by trained NAEYC assessors, a national commission composed of recognized experts in childcare and early childhood education reviewed the center's self-study and the parent's evaluation . The Center was judged to be in substantial compliance with the Academy's Criteria and in 1991 was granted accreditation – one of the few child care centers in the state to be so accredited.

680291;FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH;207 - 8TH STREET NORTH;CLANTON;AL;35045;CHILTON;(205)755-0490;http://clantonfumc.org/;;"Directed by Linda Niles, the FUMC Preschool meets during the school year, 5 days a week, from 8:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon, with extended care available until 3:30 p.m for a class of 10.

The preschool uses the children's wing of the church (the education building), the music room, and the old fellowship hall (Crossroads Cafe) for snack and party time or large group activities such as a visit from a postal worker, a dental assistant, or cooking experiences. We also use the Activity Center for pictures and playtime in the gym. The chapel is used two days per month and the sanctuary is used at various times during the year.

The classroom activities are structured and planned to help each child grow mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially, according to their own individual needs. The Staff believes that children learn best by doing; therefore the classrooms are a busy, noisy place where children are exploring all areas of learning. We incorporate field trips and guests who come to the school for more learning experiences.

The preschool is for children between the ages of 2 to 4 years. Some students repeat the four-year-old class if the parent feels they are not ready to enter the public school kindergarten.

Everyone benefits from our preschool! This program blesses all the community, children, teachers, and members of the church. As ministry of First United Methodist Church, the preschool opens the door for exposure to those students who are unchurched.

Preschool registration is held each spring, with enrollment of approximately 90 children. When classes are full, a waiting list is kept for the current year. New students can then enroll at any time during the year when an opening arises.

Our preschool office has an open door policy. If you would like to visit our preschool, please contact our Preschool Director, Linda Niles. We do follow DHR and the State of Alabama guidelines for background checks for teachers, substitutes and aides. Safety of the children is the first priority.";http://clantonfumc.org/;;8:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.;;http://www.clantonfumc.org/aboutpreschool.php;;n;n;y;y;n;n;http://www.clantonfumc.org/images/clantonfumclogos.gif;http://www.clantonfumc.org/images/aboutpreschool.jpg;;;;;

Founded in 1970, Glenwood prides itself as being a school where family and Christian values are respected, and classes are structured and based on traditional curriculum. 

Glenwood School was founded on the basis that its students would function within a Christian, family-oriented environment. As a reminder of the school's values, each day begins with the Lord's Prayer and Pledge of Allegiance. Chapel services are held regularly. Students are expected to conduct themselves with dignity and courtesy at all times. Glenwood recognizes the family unit as the fundamental building block of Christian society. Thus, parents play an important role in the Glenwood philosophy and are encouraged to participate in a large variety of school activities. Additionally, parents are encouraged to support the school's discipline code and to ""practice what we teach"" at home. 

​Accredited by the Alabama Independent School Association (AISA) and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), Glenwood seeks to provide a whole-education, to prepare students for college and potential occupations, to prepare today's youth to become tomorrow's leaders. As a nondenominational Christian School, Glenwood supports biblical and traditional family values while respecting various ethnic backgrounds.

    Building a trusting relationship with each child
    Providing responsive, individualized care
    Creating an environment that supports and encourages exploration
    Developing partnerships with parents and caregivers

Our Child Development Centers are programs based on the philosophy that all children can learn, and they are provided with the tools and support necessary to foster learning. Child Development Centers are licensed by the Department of Human Resources and provide an optimal setting for young learners (6 weeks - 5 years old) of varying levels of development. Our setting includes small class sizes and support staff. The limited number of children per class and additional staff allow classroom instructors to implement a curriculum appropriate for every level of development and readiness.

Our qualified and experienced teachers possess either a Bachelor of Science, Associates Degree, CDA or are studying for CDA. Other childcare providers are experienced and attend workshops to improve skills. For our team to hone their skills, they attend a minimum of 12 hours of development activities each year.

Thornton Sr., Pastor.  After hearing the voice of the Lord and laboring in much prayer, House of Light Church International was birthed.  This church began in Bishop Thornton's home with seven (7) people in attendance at the first meeting.  The church was organized and structured.  This church meets twice weekly; on Sunday for praise/worship and Wednesday nights for prayer/bible study.  Three months later, the church had outgrown Bishop Thornton's home.  It was time to move; so the church moved to another house in June 1996, where it remained for four years.  

           The church moved a third time in June 2000 to another building where it dwelt for six years until the completion of the new edifice in June 2006.  Bishop Thornton is a pioneer and a man of great faith who believes that there is nothing too hard for the Lord, and that he can do all things through Christ who gives him strength.  Bishop Thornton continues to walk by faith, not by sight.

               House of Light Church International's main focus is leading people into the saving knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and empowering them to live victorious lives through the Word of God.  It is our goal to build people of purpose, prayer, power and praise so that they can glorify God in every area of their lives.";http://www.houseoflightministries.org/holci-ministriesoutreaches.html?m;;;;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;http://www.houseoflightministries.org/uploads/3/0/2/7/3027668/1327778965.jpg;;;;;;

Our mission at Kids First is to express the grace of Jesus Christ while lovingly providing Christian childcare and education to the children and families of the community. We firmly believe and teach that it is necessary to know Jesus Christ as the Lord of Life and that the Bible is God’s true word. Kids First is also dedicated to helping children develop and learn to their highest potential in a fun and exciting environment.

We have several philosophies that direct our childcare methods. They are as follows:

    We believe children are a gift from God and as Christian educators we are to follow Jesus’ command: “Let the little children come and do not hinder them.” (Matthew 19:14)
    We believe in teaching and modeling Christ’s love in a developmentally appropriate environment under the supervision and structure created by professional, trained educators.
    We believe that children learn through playing, creating, and exploring.
    We believe in educating children in order that they may reach their greatest potential.
    We believe children should have fun and always be safe.
    We believe that a child enrolled is a family enrolled.
    We believe in putting time and effort into acquiring and maintaining open, friendly, and cooperative relationships with each child’s family.
    We believe in helping all those who walk through our doors to develop and grow in their relationship with Jesus.

During school time an East Lawrence School bus will pick up school age children in the morning and brings them back to our facility in the evening.

We have an excellent Pre K program- Mrs. Bonnie has a degree in Early Childhood Development, and is wonderful helping the children learn. We use workbooks from the ABEKA program. At the end of each school year (sometime in May) we will have a small graduation for the Pre K class.

We have a staff of 14 and we are all here because we love children and we enjoy spending every day with them and making them happy and helping them learn new things. We don't just babysit at Kids Kount, we make a point to try and teach children of all ages something new daily.

Currently, the CPC and CPCA are working toward unifying the two denominations into one United Cumberland Presbyterian Church. (For info on the unification effort, visit www.cumberland.org/unification/)

Though we do have various relationships with the two larger American Presbyterian denominations, we are not part of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) nor are we part of the Presbyterian Church USA (PCUSA). The Cumberland Presbyterian Church has its own General Assembly, so the actions of any other Presbyterian body are not the actions of the CPC.

Homewood CPC participates in community and city ecumenical efforts as well as the Birmingham Benevolence Network (an association of churches social services in the Birmingham area whose purpose is to coordinate benevolence efforts so as to help people in need without hurting them by enabling destructive behaviors or codependency).

We partner with the Brother Bryan Mission and The Lovelady Center, as well as The Wellhouse, Pathways Birmingham, and Magic City Harvest.

We invite you to come and experience the saving message of ""God for us"" in Christ Jesus at Homewood CPC. We have a place for you!";https://www.facebook.com/HomewoodCPC/info?tab=page_info;https://www.facebook.com/HomewoodCPC/info?tab=page_info;"Mon - Fri:

Our business was founded on the principle that all children learn best through play. Singing, dancing, reading, and free play are always part of a child’s everyday activities. We feel that one of the greatest gifts that we can give a child is a love for learning.
We believe that children are a gift from God.

Our message is really quite simple:  we believe that the foundation of spiritual inheritance in the Kingdom of God is the relationship between each believer and our heavenly Father.  ""Build them big; big people will do big things!""  This is the focal point of our ministry...building people big by defining Kingdom Living.  Pastors Bob and Jackie McClain are committed to the belief that the church should prepare the saints for the work of their ministry....spreading the gospel of the Kingdom as they go to their jobs, businesses, communities, recreation, or in retirement functions. Today, that vision given in 1987 sees a partial fulfillment.

Bible stories are taught daily.  The children learn that God loves them; that Jesus is the child’s best friend and that teachers love them.Children are taught to play and work with others; to feel secure, wanted and happy; to be helpful and kind. The mission of Mars Hill Bible School is to provide every student, in a cooperative effort with the home and local congregations, a Christ-centered, Bible-based education in an environment that fosters spiritual, academic, physical and social growth.

As children enter the “Discovery” first floor hallway of our Children’s Ministry wing, they will DISCOVER that God is, God loves them, and He desires us to love and serve Him. Visiting families check in at our Children’s Information Desk at the entrance to the Preschool area and our volunteers will direct you to your child’s Bible classroom for Sunday and/or Wednesday. 

With our check-in/check-out system, you realize your child is entering a fun and safe place for him or her to learn about God.  We offer many ways for preschoolers to “Grow with God,” including Bible classes with caring and loving teachers; Sunday morning children's worship, which we call Celebration Station; Sunday Night Kid’s Praise; and various preschool activities throughout the year.  We use a variety of ways to teach preschoolers the Bible through hands-on activities, puppet shows, multimedia, Bible-centered lessons, and more. We would love for you and your family to come see what Preschool at Mayfair is all about!";http://www.mayfair.org/#/children/preschool;https://www.facebook.com/mayfairchurch?ref=ts&fref=ts;;;;;n;y;y;y;y;y;;https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1796460_1018223761526050_3558720249660392598_n.jpg?oh=eae41fa84fe993679733f6f1c9df4f1e&oe=55AE44CF&__gda__=1433696767_cc1efd12551c4bdd2ebb3a5b391e98fa;https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1653589_1023109317704161_8803583037487248704_n.jpg?oh=9a3caf1efe2c8aa626e1dd9ce80ad650&oe=55A7143C&__gda__=1437694818_174e963a4dee98d2c52a5d215ef5fdb5;https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10409324_996309760384117_8691813067378174095_n.jpg?oh=c3e62fb6a97284c7baf7320eb3372542&oe=55727580&__gda__=1436949862_def7002187faa2e4f3030e190dfee6e2;https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10847791_992765390738554_8832778897350179475_n.jpg?oh=a7ac7d8ed9976f731d32d6ce6b540e38&oe=559FDDB1&__gda__=1433650671_8cd73917a1e2ff3be5d8b03d63914b2b;;

The school’s focus has always been to prepare our diverse student body through a rigorous academic curriculum in reading, writing, math and science before they enter elementary school in the public school system. Its mission, established in the tradition of educators Mable McRae and Oralee Gaines, is to “to give our students the opportunity to receive an excellent education ‘from the least to the greatest. McRae-Gaines’ students are usually reading at a competent level by the age of three and they are exposed to number theory, nature, music, art and basic theater production even at the pre-school level. Mrs. Barbara Harris offers an accelerated, award winning Kindergarten program covering appropriate levels of reading, spelling, history and science through the State of Alabama’s Office of School Readiness. In addition, Sister R. Abayomi Goodall teaches dance and music and visual art projects.  Our staff provides a six-week Summer Enrichment Program that focuses on movement, art, dance and performance arts as well as reading and creative writing. The McRae-Gaines Learning Center is a certified provider of child-care and pre-school programming for the State of Alabama Department of Human Resources. Subsidies for placement at McRae-Gaines are available to parents receiving services from the Department. The school also partners with the Wallace Community College in Selma (WCCS) to make affordable child care available to single and low-income parents attending WCCS.  Subsidies are likewise available for student/parents who maintain a required grade level in their college courses.;http://www.mcraegaineslearningcenter.org/;;;;;;n;y;y;y;n;n;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/999cc9_3ae2ef004927496b9ee29cf918dbf51b.jpg_srb_p_117_118_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/999cc9_55b7a6c2d20df968630861da130e6b9d.jpg_srb_p_701_467_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/999cc9_aad2b17f8efe79a00a8e959f770b0102.png_srb_p_701_473_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_png_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/999cc9_afe9368d8229e59ba5840a27cc464c7b.jpg_srb_p_701_467_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/999cc9_62075b8d99045db409a8b5884330981e.jpg_srb_p_701_467_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srb;;

This is accomplished in a number of ways. Sunday School offers an opportunity to study the Word of God and build relationships. Discipleship Training allows us to explore our walk with the Lord by learning about ourselves and our personal walk with the Lord.  Wednesday nights provide an opportunity to learn about missions, to study God's Word, and a time for  prayer.  RA's and GA's are all part of our Children's ministry and we have a growing youth ministry.  The most important thing we do each week is gather together as a Body of Christ and worship our Lord.  Our worship results in ministry possibilities and service opportunities.;http://www.millbrookbaptistchurch.net/;;8:30am-7pm;;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;http://tiptopwebsite.com/photos4/millbrookbapt/churchlogo.jpg;http://tiptopwebsite.com/photos4/millbrookbapt/s_photo2.JPG;http://tiptopwebsite.com/photos4/millbrookbapt/s_photo2.JPG;http://tiptopwebsite.com/photos4/millbrookbapt/s_IMG_0836.jpg;http://tiptopwebsite.com/photos4/millbrookbapt/s_IMG_7691.jpg;;

The Early Intervention program is funded through the Alabama Department of Rehabilitative Services and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Most children grow and learn at a similar pace. If a child is not developing at or about the same rate as other children, that child may be experiencing a developmental delay. Early Intervention works to identify the special needs of a child and coordinates an individualized plan of services. All Early Intervention services and therapies are provided in the child's natural environment i.e., the child's home, daycare setting, etc. CSP's Early Intervention service coordinators will work with the family to determine the best setting. Family involvement is crucial to case management of these children. If a child is eligible for Early Intervention services, an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) is developed by the parents, the child's service coordinator and other service providers. An IFSP describes the services to be provided for a child including the frequency, time and location. The plan includes functional outcomes that will help a child reach full potential. The IFSP also plans for subsequent services, if needed, for when the child reaches age three.;http://www.cspwal.com/education-locations.aspx;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Community-Service-Programs-of-West-Alabama/178421844375?ref=ts;"Mon - Thu:

We believe in one God who has no beginning and no ending, who created everything that exists or has ever existed whether it is visible or invisible.

We believe this one great God manifests Himself in three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who is the Word of God, who was made flesh, being all God and all man at the same time.

We believe that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of the New Testament in that:

* He was born of a virgin.
* He lived a sinless life.
* He was tempted in all aspects of life and over came all temptations.

He was crucified on the cross, becoming the sins of mankind past, present and future. He died and paid the price for man’s sin and reconciled God with man through His precious Blood.
His body was buried in a borrowed tomb, while He set the captives free, taking the sting of death, taking the victory from the grave, and the keys from Satan. He rose, after being buried for 3 days, in a Glorified Body, on that third day morning, with all power in His hands. He is now sitting in the place of Honor on the right hand of the Father.

We believe once a man has repented of his sins that if he confesses with his mouth the Lord Jesus, and believes in his heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.

We believe in Baptism by immersion in water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as a public confession of the believer’s death, burial, and resurrection in Jesus Christ.

We believe in the observance of the Lord’s Supper as Jesus commanded.

We believe in the Great Commission of Jesus Christ “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you….”

We believe Jesus is coming back soon, very soon!

Daily activities mimic a smaller scale routine similar to those they will experience once they leave the comfort of this program and move forward into their formal schooling.

Our approach to early childhood curriculum is based on what we know to be age-appropriate practices for young children. However, we also understand the fundamental premise that developmentally appropriate curriculum begins with each child.

Our approach reaches beyond the patterns of development as described in textbooks and is adapted to meet the changing interests, abilities, and needs of the particular children in our programs. We have developed an Odyssey Curriculum that applies different aspects of the numerous curricula available today and thereby provide a program that is truly capable of engaging each individual child.

The curriculum for children at Odyssey emphasizes creating a caring, nurturing program, with the development of a stimulating learning environment for each child as a fundamental goal. Children grow to see themselves as important and competent individuals when they are nourished by the unconditional caring and concern of significant adults in their lives. Caring teachers celebrate children's discoveries and offer their encouragement for children's efforts. Responsive interactions reassure children not only that they can rely upon the adults who care for and teach them, but also that each child is a valued, important person. The success of Odyssey's staff is best measured by the extent to which we are able to help each child see themselves as a valued individual and an able learner.

Our city nestles on the northern bank of the beautiful Tennessee River and is part of a quad-city area known as ""The Shoals."" As our name implies, we provide families of the Shoals area a distinctively Christian education opportunity emphasizing the pursuit of excellence in character, academic achievement and service to Christ by serving others.

Incorporated in 1997 by the merging of two schools sponsored by Christ Chapel and Woodmont Baptist Church,  SCS was founded in order to provide a non-denominational approach to Christian education. We welcome students from a variety of churches and denominations.  Graduating our first class in 2000, SCS has graduates attending colleges, universities,  and graduate programs throughout the nation. (click here for list) SCS is governed by a Board of Directors responsible for the direction of the Headmaster who oversees the daily operation of the school.

Our approach to Christian education is student centered. Small class size allows our teachers to develop a personal relationship with each student. Our committed faculty and staff seek to work in partnership with your family to provide each student an opportunity to develop his or her strengths and talents. The nurturing, spiritual environment at SCS endeavors to build a strong foundation that empowers students to serve God courageously and joyfully, thus equipping students to fulfill God's calling on their lives. Our prayer is for each student to develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and upon graduation to know what they believe, why they believe it, and to be able to defend their beliefs with gentleness and respect.

Believing that disadvantaged children suffered from a lack of money rather than a lack of intelligence, a war on poverty was launched.

St. Clair County Head Start strives to provide high quality comprehensive services to the children and families served. It also works to establish a partnership between federal and local staff to continuously improve quality Head Start delivery.  A comprehensive  relationship is nurtured  with local school systems in order to deliver high quality services.

St. Clair County Head Start has provided area children with opportunities and experiences they might not have otherwise had since 1965. This program was created to break the cycle of poverty by providing a program designed to meet the emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs of the students we serve.

This program was housed in church basements, classrooms of St. Clair County Training School, old Eden Elementary School, and then finally, in the early 1980s moved  to its present site  Coal City School.

The initial Head Start Program began in 1965 under the leadership of Mr. John Davis.  Mr. Walter M. Kennedy was instrumental in making this a model program in St. Clair County. Under his administration, the program progressively grew from 20, 100, to 160 students until he  retired.

The baton was then passed on to Mrs. Elsie H. McGowan in 1994. The program grew even more to 217 students with more than 40 staff members and (2) 7-member governing bodies. After 16 years of dedicated service, she retired September 2010.

The program was led by 2 dedicated Co-Interim Directors, Mrs. Stephanie Stinson and Mrs. Susan Bradt from September 2010 until June 2011. They each served dual roles as Chief Fiscal Officer and HSTARS Manager respectively.

The torch is currently carried by Ms. LaToya Orr as Executive Director since June 2011, and the program currently strives to move onward and upward.";http://www.stclaircountyheadstart.com/?PageName=%27Directions%27;;;;http://www.stclaircountyheadstart.com/?PageName=%27Forms%27&iSection=%27Administrative%27&CorrespondingID=%270%27;http://www.stclaircountyheadstart.com/?PageName=%27Handbook%27;n;n;y;y;n;n;;http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_4619/1474b1c53dfbe14ac2dbe44a4bf22b69.jpg;http://images.schoolinsites.com/cache/School_4619/c6af53486bb663d3c4387d53c60d2261.jpg;;;;

Guided by the Holy Spirit, and through the intercession of Mary, the Mother of God, we participate in the life of the Church through liturgy, prayer, service, and fellowship. We are strengthened by the sacraments, grounded in sacred scripture and tradition, and directed by the teachings of the Catholic Church. Through this foundation, ongoing and individual discipleship and a “New Evangelization” methodology, we will spread the Gospel to the youth of the Parish and develop a new generation of young, Catholic evangelists.​

Some of the children who have come through our program have brought their own children to the CDC.

The purpose of the center is to extend the ministry of University Baptist Church to preschoolers and their families by providing loving care and quality preschool education to help each child develop to his/her greatest potential - in physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual ways.

Our goal is to provide an affordable, quality education for children to grow and learn in a safe environment where they will be nutured and loved. Many of our faculty members are church members, or former members, and they have been with the CDC for years. They have valuable experience and continuing education to their credit.

Our concern is to care for each child, giving individual attention to their needs. Each child is a precious gift from God. We want to help them to grow up with the understanding that God loves them and wants to have a relationship with them through every stage of their life.

If you are a parent or legal guardian looking for a quality, affordable education for your preschooler, we encourage you to give us a call or come by. We would be happy to set up an appointment time for you to come by and learn more about what is offered.

Information about pricing, hours, and programs can be found on this website or you may prefer to see us in person.

The church later changed its name to Westminster Presbyterian Church, and WCA remains a ministry of the church with oversight by the church's elders.

Westminster Christian Academy offers Christian parents academic excellence in the context of God's eternal truth.

At North Wood Child Enrichment Center we offer a safe haven for your child. One that honors their childhood and respects the child as well. Our approach to child development is different in the fact that we consider the whole child, the hands, heart, and head of each and every person present. Our mission is to provide an expansive program that engages the child cognitively, actively, and emotionally. We recognize and welcome the unique gifts brought be each child we serve, encourage independent thinking and imagination and foster a life-long love of learning. Our goal is to engage the mind, fire the imagination, and strengthen the will, thereby sharpening the skills our children need in our ever changing local and global community.
We chose to include the internal development of a child by offering everyday healthy real food, by providing a abundance of opportunities to express their creativity through the arts, and stimulating activities to challenge their intellect as well.
At The North Wood we believe in community and buying local. We practice being green in recycling and in composting for the garden. Our values are in our connectiveness to each other and the environment at hand.
We will be having a children’s gardening class with master gardeners from the area. The children will be developing a garden from the bottom up and harvesting and eating the fruits of their labor.
Music class will be offered, which will encourage self expression and the use of several instruments, as well as several art projects. Daily exercise and yoga will be experienced and we will also be involved with our local Florence Public Library summer program and appreciate the richness that literature has to offer to our children.
We believe that creativity is the corner stone of intelligence and this is why we will provide a space for many open ended endeavors that will be challenging and fun all at the same time.
So if you desire something different for your child this summer, consider The North Wood Child Enrichment Center at Living Spirit, an atmosphere rich in values, art, creativity, health and wellness and environmental awareness.
Our space is limited and registration is on a first come first serve basis.";https://livingspiritchurch.wordpress.com/the-north-wood-child-enrichment-center/;;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;https://livingspiritchurch.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/north-wood.jpg?w=584&h=346;;;;;;

Huntsville Christian Academy was established by Reggie and Cathy Whiddon in August 1993 because of their conviction that God never intended for the secular government to control education.

God gave only the home and the church the responsibility to educate children. In doing so, Huntsville Christian Academy's main philosophy is to teach each student to view life as taught in the Holy Bible.

Each student is taught from a Biblical perspective. This allows each student to be exposed to character building principles that will last a lifetime. These Biblical values and concepts are considered foundational to meaningful interpersonal relationships and productive living.

Character development is the common thread woven throughout the entire fabric of Huntsville Christian Academy.

 
Academic Excellence:
Huntsville Christian Academy takes a unique approach to educating students.  This approach is back-to-basics. Our system works with each child in their concrete and abstract learning phases, and a scope and sequence that fits your child's learning. Your children learn quickly by using the most advanced curriculum and instruction used worldwide.

Before enrollment each family has an appointment to tour the school and get details of the classroom.  This is a ""no pressure"" appointment.  Use this appointment to learn more about the school, the curriculum, and the staff. After the appointment, many students spend a day with us to get a feel for the classroom.

Every new student is given a diagnostic test that allows us to custom fit each child with his/ her curriculum needs. This test is to pin-point skills the student is needing to master. The student is then prescribed curriculum around the particular subject material needing mastery. Therefore, every child is assured of receiving a personalized, custom-fitted program to meet his/her specific need.

Your child is afforded personalized, one-on-one instruction from our dedicated and trained staff. A lesson plan is not developed for an entire class to be lock-stepped together. Your child is an individual and no two children are the same, so children learn at different paces and levels. With Huntsville Christian Academy, your child has a lesson plan designed to meet his or her academic needs.";http://www.gohca.com/;;6:45 AM-5:30 PM;;;http://www.gohca.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=64&Itemid=75;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.gohca.com/images/stories/hcalogo.jpg;http://www.gohca.com/images/IMG_0447.JPG;http://www.gohca.com/images/stories/IMG_0541.JPG;http://www.gohca.com/images/stories/IMG_0491.JPG;http://www.gohca.com/images/stories/IMG_0461.JPG;;

The Early Intervention program is funded through the Alabama Department of Rehabilitative Services and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Most children grow and learn at a similar pace. If a child is not developing at or about the same rate as other children, that child may be experiencing a developmental delay. Early Intervention works to identify the special needs of a child and coordinates an individualized plan of services. All Early Intervention services and therapies are provided in the child's natural environment i.e., the child's home, daycare setting, etc. CSP's Early Intervention service coordinators will work with the family to determine the best setting. Family involvement is crucial to case management of these children. If a child is eligible for Early Intervention services, an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) is developed by the parents, the child's service coordinator and other service providers. An IFSP describes the services to be provided for a child including the frequency, time and location. The plan includes functional outcomes that will help a child reach full potential. The IFSP also plans for subsequent services, if needed, for when the child reaches age three.;http://www.cspwal.com/education-locations.aspx;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Community-Service-Programs-of-West-Alabama/178421844375?ref=ts;"Mon - Thu:

The Church’s title to the property at its present location dates back to April 21, 1869, at which time the present Indian Creek Church was known as the African Baptist Church. Reverend Ned Coleman, who was also known as Reverend Ned Clay, was the founder and first pastor of the Indian Creek Church.

After the pastorate of Reverend Clay came the service of Reverend J. Kempfield. During Kempfield’s administration, the church separated from the Indian Creek Association and joined the Mallard Creek Association, of which it continues to be a member today. Reverend Kempfield was known to have baptized fifty-three candidates in one day.

Reverend Ned Patrick, the third pastor of Indian Creek served well and added many souls to the church. During his pastorate, a new roof and a new ceiling were added to the church.

In 1937, the Reverend Sonnie Hereford became the fourth pastor of Indian Creek P.B. Church. The church observed growth, both spiritually and physically. His ability to organize and conduct church activities drew great attention. Reverend Hereford put weather boarding around the church, dug a well, built a pastor’s living quarters and also laid a church cornerstone.";http://www.indiancreekpb.org/;;;;;;not mentioned;not mentioned;not mentioned;not mentioned;not mentioned;not mentioned;;http://www.indiancreekpb.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/montage1.jpg;http://www.indiancreekpb.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/preaching_600.jpg;http://www.indiancreekpb.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Troop.jpg;http://www.indiancreekpb.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dining.jpg;;

1033825;PHENIX CITY FIRST ASSEMBLY OF GOD;3777 HIGHWAY 431 NORTH;PHENIX CITY;AL;36868;RUSSELL;(334)298-3588;http://phenixcityfirst.org/kids.php;;"Around 1935, a group of 13 young people from Columbus, GA “came across the river” and held tent revival meetings here in Phenix City, AL. The young people were led by Reverend Emory Andrews, who felt the call to start an Assembly of God Church in Phenix City. The Revival Meetings were a huge success, and from that small beginning, the group began holding regular services around January of 1935 at the corner of 7th Ave and 20th St.

On April 28, 1935, The Reverend J.C. Thames (then superintendent of the Alabama District) presided over the opening of the Church. Reverend Andrews was elected as church pastor of The Phenix City Assembly of God. It was not until sometime around 1946 that it began going by its present name of First Assembly of God.

Shortly thereafter, the church held a tent revival, led by Rev. A.S. Davis, and started to grow rapidly. The congregation had to move into a new building on the corner of Flinn Alley and 10th Ave. Members and friends donated the materials and labor to build the new church.

Since that time, First Assembly has moved to its current location at 3777 Highway 431 North. Under our current Pastor, Barry Danner, First Assembly has built: a new sanctuary with fellowship hall, youth building, royal ranger cabins, young adult building, women’s ministries Grace Place, storage facilities and bus sheds, and many building projects on the way. First Assembly now averages nearly 1,000 people every Sunday morning.

Through the years, First Assembly has been blessed by the men who have served as its pastor. Former Pastors, in order of their service are as follows: Emory T. Andrews, A.S. Davis, H.F. Freeman, J.B. Bauldree, A.S. Davis, W..A.D. Hill, Wyley Davis, Charlie Kennedy, Fred Martin, A.L. Valdez, Sammy Mizell, A.L. Valdez, James Ballard, A.G. Pope, W.L. Baker, William D. Slay, Charles S. Raley, W.T. Grant, Randy Comer & our current pastor, Barry Danner.";http://phenixcityfirst.org/kids.php;https://www.facebook.com/pages/First-Assembly-of-God/401551616581705?ref=hl;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;;;;;;;

In addition to Infant Care, Toddler Care and Preschool, we offer a Before and After School Program.   We are open from 6:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.   We are located just north of the Pants Barn in Meridianville, Alabama.  Please contact our Director, Brandi Tatum to arrange for a tour of our facility.  She will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

It is the philosophy of KiddieLand Childcare and Preschool that early childhood should be a time of fun, warmth, security, exploring and discovery.  Our purpose is to provide an atmosphere that encourages social, emotional, physical and intellectual growth and development of a child.  Planned within the framework of philosophy and purpose, the curriculum includes sharing and conversation time; stories, songs and fingerplays; creative art activities and craft; games and outside time to run, play and explore; science and nature; exposure to shapes, colors, numbers and letters; and celebration of birthdays and holidays.

Our everyday goal is to keep children happy, healthy and safe while learning!  We strive to have each child prepared for kindergarten before they leave KiddieLand.

Here at KiddieLand, as owners, we have over 30 years of experience in childcare.  Your child will be loved and cared for each day, as well as taught in a relaxed, family atmosphere with plenty of socializing along with structured classes.  We place great importance on a child’s learning and development.  Individuality and uniqueness are recognized and special attention is given accordingly.

Our facility is licensed and inspected by the State of Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Fire Department and Health Department.  Our teachers are trained in First Aid and CPR and required to participate in continuing training.  All staff members are required to pass criminal background checks.

The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater St. Louis envisions a future in which success is within reach of every child in the St. Louis region, empowering themselves and influencing future generations toward making a difference for themselves, their community and the global community.  Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater St. Louis is proud to be a part of Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a 151 year old national movement that serves 4.2 million youth with 51,000 trained professional staff members at some 4,000 clubs in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and military bases around the world. Originally formed in 1860 in Hartford, CT, by a group of women as a positive alternative to the streets for boys, it became an affiliated organization in 1906 in Boston, MA when 53 clubs joined to become the Federated Boys Club. Having become the Boys Club of America in 1931 and was chartered by the United States Congress in 1956. The national organization officially became the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in 1991.

Since 1967, BGCSTL has been providing a safe place for children to learn and grow.  The Club now serves over 5,700 kids, including over 3,400 registered Club members at five sites and within several other schools in the St. Louis region.  The Club is open during hours that kids are most likely to need a safe place to go — after school and during summer.

We serve kids in more than 90 zip codes, and our average daily attendance is over 450 youth.  36 board members, 95 full- and part-time staff members, and 750 volunteers work diligently to create, implement and sustain programming that nurtures the growth and self-esteem of members.  Volunteers donate roughly 30,000 hours of their time annually.

Nearly all of the youth we serve are growing up in single-parent households and are considered low-income.  Club members often face multiple challenges, such as lack of income for basic needs, dilapidated housing, family instability, and exposure to violence and drug use.  To meet those challenges, BGCSTL offers high quality, comprehensive programs which address the wide range of risks faced and skills needed by youth.

Talented Tots Learning Center exists to provide families with childcare that promotes a safe, nurturing, and educational environment where children grow socially, emotionally, and academically.
Vision
Talented Tots will provide children with the education and experiences needed to assure early success and school readiness. Parent Involvement is critical in the development of a child. We form a partnership with parents by providing weekly newsletters and daily information sheets on what their child has learned each day. We will provide a safe atmosphere where children can learn to communicate and express themselves amongst peers.
Core Values
We value learning and understand that children learn in different ways. We encourage self-esteem and want each child to recognize their strengths and feel confident as they become ready to enter kindergarten. We value respect for every child, family, and staff member.

Early childhood development sets the foundation for lifelong learning, behavior, and health. We believe development is interrelated and therefore our preschool program philosophy espouses that children have a natural curiosity that is nurtured though an integrated, authentic, play-based approach. We believe that development advances when children have opportunities to practice new skills as well as when they experience a challenge just beyond their present level of mastery. Children develop at different rates, learn in different ways, and express their knowledge in different ways. They learn best in an environment where they feel safe, valued and loved.
 
Sprout students will be immersed in an enriching environment with materials that offer opportunity for exploration and discovery and our curriculum will be a responsive one that follows a developmental continuum ensuring each child is ready for kindergarten. This curriculum includes exploration of science, mathematics, social studies, literacy, drama, music, creative movement, visual arts and the Bible.";http://www.sproutacademypreschool.com/;;;;;;n;y;y;y;n;n;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mxhf4hbldNI/T5WdGKINrTI/AAAAAAAABQY/j6FZszN1Pbk/s790/Blog%2BHeader.jpg;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AAye2XHgDtk/TzbPv21ypSI/AAAAAAAABPY/-B60my5Ptk8/s1600/blocks.png;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zw_5N2WGZmw/TzbNiQHBH2I/AAAAAAAABO4/U8wHFkL_yxk/s1600/praying+child.png;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OoqhHHL4rwU/TzbMle0u0sI/AAAAAAAABOw/QrM1DmU73D0/s1600/kids+paint.png;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iZsJOXVlfWk/TzbO8VwZDRI/AAAAAAAABPQ/WnM5KQN6Zvo/s1600/girl+paint.png;;

It is centrally located in the heart of the Jeff Vander Lou neighborhood and was designed as the "" Negro District"" in the 1800's.  Jeff Vander Lou was one of the few areas in the city of Saint Louis where African Americans were permitted to own real estate. As a result, prominent African Americans such as ragtime composer, Scott Joplin and Negro League Baseball player, James Cool Papa Bell resided here.  Needless to say, the quality of education in this area was once very competitive. As post war and over crowding factors lessened the restrictions on African American real estate purchases, other African American communities sprouted up.

Our classes provide for a significant amount of one on one interaction and small group activities, allowing us to adapt an individual learning plan for each student. We also recognize that a strong parent/teacher communication is ideal to help each child develop to their full potential.

We encourage each child to explore their environment and challenge them to try new activities daily.

Owners Orson and Sandra Guyton are grandparents of three special needs children. As such, they are all too familiar with the ostracism and discrimination that the families of these children experience from daycare establishments. From “liability issues” to “ill-equipped staff members & facilities,” the Guyton’s have heard it all. Finally, Mrs. Guyton, a devote Christian, felt her calling to aid the community by providing quality care for all children regardless of their health or care requirements.

Established in January of 2012, Giggle Buggs has made a name for itself in the community as a childcare center that genuinely cares about its children and their families (foster families included). Sticking true to their word, the Guyton’s have served children with special needs such as spinal bifida, juvenile diabetes, autism, down syndrome, epilepsy, etc. Although Giggle Buggs focuses primarily on academia, it is our mission to guide our children in a holistically beneficial way. Every child should be nurtured and every child should be individually and uniquely cared for. Which is also why we provide our parents with resources that can help their children progress further and we work directly with the childrens' therapists to ensure that their care plan is a consistent team effort. Thank you for your interest in our services.";www.facebook.com/gigglebuggschildcareandlearningcenter;www.facebook.com/gigglebuggschildcareandlearningcenter;"Mon - Fri:

Over the past year, we have reached benchmarks that demonstrate success. Our organization continues to reflect a commitment to excellence in everything we do. We focus our work in three key areas, because nurturing the potential of children, helping people live halthier and supporting our neighbors are fundamental to strengthening communities. We believe that to bring about meaningful change in individuals and communities, we must be focused and accountable. At the Y, we measure the success of our cause by how well we engage communities in our three areas of focus:
Youth Development: Nurturing the potential of every child and teen.
Healthy Living: Improving the nation's health and well-being.
Social Responsibility: Giving back and providing support to our neighbors.                                                                                       The Y is for everyone. Our programs, services and initiatives enable kids to realize their potential, prepare teens for college, offer ways for families to have fun together, empower people to be healthier in spirit, mind and body, prepare people for employment, welcome and embrace newcomers and help foster a nationwide service ethic. And that's just the beginning.
The Ozarks Regional YMCA is a not-for-profit organization that believes no one should be denied access to membership and/or programs due to the inability to pay. These funds are subsidized through the United Way of the Ozarks and through the Y Annual Campaign.";http://www.orymca.org/;https://www.facebook.com/orymca1;"Mon - Fri:

686396;OZARKS REGIONAL YMCA;601 LEARNING LN;MONETT;MO;65708;BARRY;(417) 235-8213;http://www.orymca.org/;info@orymca.org;"The Ozarks Regional YMCA was established in Springfield in 1888, and our association is made up of eight family centers, including two Springfield locations, Ward Downtown YMCA and Pat Jones YMCA, Ozark Mountain Family YMCA in Hollister, Monett Area YMCA, Cassville YMCA, Roy Blunt YMCA of Bolivar, Dallas County Area YMCA in Buffalo, Lebanon Family YMCA, YMCA Camp Wakonda and the School Age Services branch. Over the past year, we have reached benchmarks that demonstrate success. Our organization continues to reflect a commitment to excellence in everything we do. We focus our work in three key areas, because nurturing the potential of children, helping people live halthier and supporting our neighbors are fundamental to strengthening communities. We believe that to bring about meaningful change in individuals and communities, we must be focused and accountable. At the Y, we measure the success of our cause by how well we engage communities in our three areas of focus:
Youth Development: Nurturing the potential of every child and teen.
Healthy Living: Improving the nation's health and well-being.
Social Responsibility: Giving back and providing support to our neighbors.                                                                                       The Y is for everyone. Our programs, services and initiatives enable kids to realize their potential, prepare teens for college, offer ways for families to have fun together, empower people to be healthier in spirit, mind and body, prepare people for employment, welcome and embrace newcomers and help foster a nationwide service ethic. And that's just the beginning.
The Ozarks Regional YMCA is a not-for-profit organization that believes no one should be denied access to membership and/or programs due to the inability to pay. These funds are subsidized through the United Way of the Ozarks and through the Y Annual Campaign.";http://www.orymca.org/;https://www.facebook.com/orymca1;"Mon - Fri:

Children's House is committed to principles of respect for each child, concern for the worth of the individual and the ideal of human brotherhood. Children's House provides a program relevant to the needs of children in a rapidly changing world. The curriculum is experimental and open ended, the atmosphere is one of personal support and caring, stressing the development of skills, concepts and values through the child's own experiences.

In the ""prepared environment"" of Children's House, the child may chose activities in the areas of daily living, sensorial education, language arts, music, foreign language, science, small and gross motor play, fantasy play, etc. The child's independent effort is fostered and individuality is honored. The out‑of‑doors classroom is available to the child as an extension of the indoor environment

The Montessori classes include a toddler class for children age 2 to 3.5 years and preschool classes with mixed age groupings. There is an extended day class for older children to the age of 6. The ungraded aspect of the classes encourages social interaction between children and adults in a familial way which nurtures respect for and appreciation of others.

This facility is a state licensed Christian based Child Enrichment Center situated in the heart of Holts Summit. The foundation is a family owned and operated by Brett & Connie McGowan with the assistance of all four of their children. We have been reaching the needs of the families for thirteen years in Holts Summit and managed two other KIDZ ZONE Center’s sited in Jefferson City.

Owning and operating KIDZ ZONE is truly a blessing and it is considered to be our Christian ministry to the community and surrounding area. KIDZ ZONE is noted for providing superior  child care services with the key being; working closely with families and building strong relationships for teh best interest of each child.

Staff prides themselves in caring for every child as if they were their own. This includes personally getting to know the whole child and working towards goals to enhance all their developmental needs. Safety is of utmost importance and staff strives in providing a very clean, organized, and safe environment. Children’s needs are met daily and they are cared for strong bond and trust between the staff, children, and parents which helps build a sturdy foundation for the child’s social/ emotional development.

KIDZ ZONE has a construction work emphasis and as children play, staff tell them it is their “work time” and they can choose a “ZONE” they want to work with. During this work time, they are learning skills needed for kindergarten entrance and beyond. In addition, every child is exposed daily to learning experiences that are taught through weekly lesson plans. Staff offers children the opportunities to grow and learn to their full potential in all work “ZONE” areas. Every portion of the Center is designed for children to explore and have meaningful “hands on” moments of discovery.

The Bright Futures model brings together businesses, human service agencies, faith-based organizations and parent groups, and partners them with schools in a way that helps them to quickly and efficiently meet students' basic needs - often within 24 hours. This enables students and teachers to focus on education and achieving success. Bright Futures Pleasant Hill works to create an environment where education is valued and responsibility for student success is shared. Bright Futures operates under the belief that when a community invests its time, talent and treasure into its schools. students are more likely to stay in school through graduation, have a higher degree of self-worth and confidence, and set and reach goals for the futures. In turn, these students grow up to be better neighbors, quality employees and impactful leaders in their communities. ;http://www.phillumc.com/ministries/rainbow-kingdom-preschool/;https://www.facebook.com/brightfuturespleasanthill;9 am to 3 pm;;;;n;n;y;y;n;n;;http://www.phillumc.com/wp-content/uploads/rainbow-kingdom1.jpg;http://www.phillumc.com/wp-content/uploads/rainbow-kingdom.jpg;;;;

We believe that each child is a unique and special person, endowed with an individual dignity, which should be nurtured and developed as one with the body and the mind.

We believe in exposing children to all areas of development (social, emotional, physical and intellectual) so that they may be better prepared for their elementary school experience.

We provide children with the opportunity to learn about their environment, get along with and respect the rights of others, accept responsibility, develop a positive self-image, develop confidence in new situations, and handle emotions in acceptable ways. Children are encouraged to learn to help themselves and practice good health habits, develop large and small muscle coordination, develop language, solve problems, and express originality. North Cross Preschool is committed to development of the “total child”.

Our philosophy is that each child has a unique personality and will be treated as a special individual. The small teacher/student ratio allows that personalized treatment. Our purpose is to serve families in our church and community, offering them a comfortable atmosphere for their child’s growth and natural learning experiences.

North Cross Preschool offers classes for three age groups of children 2 1/2 through 5 years. Our student population, with full enrollment, is approximately 110 children. Our staff consists of 4 lead teachers, 4 teacher assistants, a music teacher, a movement teacher, and a director.

In addition to education and care services, programs provide children and their families with health, nutrition, social, and other services.

Head Start encourages the role of parents as their child's first and most important teachers. Programs build relationships with families that support positive parent-child relationships, family well-being, and connections to peers and community.

Messiah Lighthouse Child and Family Development Center, a ministry of Messiah Lutheran Church, compliments the mission of the LCFDC by providing childcare for 30 children and their families. Messiah Lighthouse opened October 1, 2009. We not only provide quality childcare, but also family support, accountability, and parental education. Our MLCFDC staff feels family support is so important, because parents are a child’s “first and forever teacher”.

";"Golden Valley Day Care is a not for profit, tax exempt childcare center that was opened in 1973 in the Methodist Church. At that time the licensing capacity was only 16 children. In 1976, the day care combined with Betty Long's Family Day Care and became licensed for 45 children. As the day care grew, it eventually moved to North 2nd Street. Fortunately they continued to grow and decided it was time to build. With the help of the Neighborhood Assistance Program and the donation of a piece of land; Golden Valley Day Care was able to design and build their very own building and be licensed to accept up to155 children.

Through the 30+ years of being in business; the day care has only had 2 Executive Directors. Betty Long became the Director when her family day care joined with the Methodist Church. Betty continually made it bigger and better until she retired in April of 2006. Betty made an impact on numerous children and their families. Through her many years she had the opportunity to touch many generations of the same family. 

In 2006, Karlee Bohannan accepted the position of Executive Director. She was born and raised in Clinton where she graduated from Clinton High School in 2002. Karlee has received her Associate Degree from State Fair Community College and has since then taken several additional college classes and trainings. She worked at the day care for 2 years as a classroom teacher while going to school along with teaching Sunday School and helping with Vacation Bible School in the past.
Karlee and her husband, Troy, reside in the country with their two daughters. She enjoys spending time with her family as much as possible. Karlee loves the outdoors and enjoys deer hunting and fishing. Her and her daughters love to go shopping together as well.

Wholesome and delicious meals are provided for the students. We provide breakfast, lunch and snacks.
The Academy accepts children ages 6 weeks to 4th grade from 6am to 6pm. Before and after school care is also available.

 
Mission
Our primary mission is to support families by providing childcare in a safe and healthy Christian environment, and offer an education that promotes the spiritual, physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development of each child.

Vision
Life A-New Preparatory Academy understands that the most critical time for a child’s learning begins during the early childhood years.  Many families seek to provide home-based learning to the children during these years; most are met with economic challenges that preclude such a structure.  Many are forced to work outside of the home and must find adequate care for their children as a result.
Our focus is on a quality Christian preschool and elementary program that fulfills the mandate found in Deuteronomy 6:7, ""And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart.  You shall teach them diligently to your children…” (NKJV). Chapel services are conducted each Wednesday where children are instructed in the Word of God.";http://life-a-new.net/;;6am-6pm;;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;;http://www.life-a-new.net/newsite/images/stories/littlefamily.jpg;http://www.life-a-new.net/newsite/images/stories/littlefather.jpg;http://www.life-a-new.net/newsite/images/stories/littleboy.jpg;http://www.life-a-new.net/newsite/images/stories/littleteacher.jpg;;

Their minds are constantly soaking, watching, listening exploring and examining, what we do, how we do it, our expressions and body language. Children gain much 0f their infancy knowledge (up to 12 mos.) through their parents, siblings and other care-givers.

It is our upmost intention to introduce every aspect of real life and the situations that accompany those aspects with all that we do. Our intentions are specific, our curriculum, being of the creative side is open ended, and has many variables to it; for instance, for two year olds we have poster-boards with letters A-Z. Beside each letter are up to seven pictures. We show the boards to the children and let them pick and interest of their choice and fly with that picture through every genre possible within our perimeters or until their interest no longer is there. We cover the seven MI (Multiple Intelligences) Read more about these on website under MI. Read more about Reggio on the “Reggio” page. Have fun!

For our upper division we have a set curriculum, again using the Creative Curriculum and the MI. We also have a list of ”daily work” each child does, name, address, etc. We encourage but never force a child into any activity.
We have day sheets for any age, just ask for your child to have one.
We have worship for up to an hour a day that includes music, craft, story, Q&A session, and dancing.
The children hold two performances a year for Worship, Our Spring Concert & our Christmas Pageant.
We are careful to include every child in any activity we offer, so no child is “left behind” Again they are never forced into any event or performance. We believe these types of performances are good for Social-Emotional growth.
As always children work in prominent in our school. Please take time to look and comment to your child about their continued daily progress.

Once your child has departed our Preschool department, he/she is then prepared to enter the Elementary ABEKA program. Please check our Elementary Department for further information. Again, we thank you for allowing us to be partners in the nurturing, development and education of your child. ;http://smbclearningcenter.org/contact.html;;6 AM - 6 PM;;;http://smbclearningcenter.org/2012-2013%20FULL%20Version%20Handbook.pdf;y;y;y;y;y;y;http://smbclearningcenter.org/LC_BANNER_8j1.jpg;;;;;;

Unlike other youth organizations, Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Kansas City are facility-based.  Our five area Clubs are strategically placed in some of Kansas City's most troubled neighborhoods.  Each unit is open when school is out, from 2-7 p.m., a critical time to be accessible by the young people who need us most.  Membership fees are minimal and scholarships are available as needed.

Boys & Girls Clubs enhance the development of youth, ages 5-18, by instilling a sense of competence, usefulness, belonging and influence.  The Clubs provide homework help, energizing sports and recreational activities, and nutritional education.  Organized core programs include Healthly Lifestyles, Education & Career Development, Technology, Public Speaking & Leadeship.  Boys & Girls Clubs are a safe place to learn and grow.  Great futures start here each and every day.

Exciting, challenging, meaningful and fun activities are planned for children each and every day that help to build a strong foundation for a lifetime of learning.";http://www.jeffco.edu/node/980;;;http://www.jeffco.edu/welcome/general-information/human-resources-employment#.VSZoJvBvTgB;;;n;y;y;y;y;y;http://www.jeffco.edu/sites/all/themes/jefferson_college/images/logo.png;http://www.jeffco.edu/sites/default/files/CDC-BANNER.jpg;http://www.jeffco.edu/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/WebphotoTwo%27s_1.JPG?itok=pNvgvEJ8;http://www.jeffco.edu/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/OutsideBlocksimage.jpg?itok=-ybrNE9z;http://www.jeffco.edu/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/child%20care%20center_0.jpg?itok=uWJnOUij;;

I am pleased to have your interest in our center and look forward to working with you and your child.  My name is Christy Jennings, and my husband; Michael and I are the owners of Building Blocks Learning Center.  I serve in the position of director and oversee all aspects of the center.  I am a lifelong resident of Lebanon, and proud to have the opportunity to provide a much needed quality service to my hometown community.  I am a Graduate of LHS, and of Missouri State University.  I worked for the Division of Youth Services from 1993 to 2008 in various positions, providing direct care to children, and managing a residential facility.  From 2008 to 2009 I worked with Laclede County Children’s Division as a Case Manager.  I have sixteen years of experience in working with children, as well as managing staff teams who provide care to children.  In 2009 I was blessed with my third child; Lucas Stewart.  My older children; Lindsey and Christian, had been cared for by my parents when they were little, however my mother had passed away in 2008, and my father was not able to provide care for Lucas.  This led me to opening a child care center, so that I could take Lucas to work with me every day, allowing me to spend time with him and supervise the care he received.  I am a devoted mother who believes that children are our most precious gift, and should be treated as such.  With this philosophy in mind, it is my goal to provide care to your child in the same way that I do for my own.  Building Blocks will provide a nurturing, learning, loving and safe environment for your child.  Many children have to spend time in child care centers during their infant, toddler, and preschool years, therefore making the experience a very important one in their lives.  I believe that children develop their ability to achieve, learn and grow during the early years in their life, which makes our job a very important one.  We will provide a structured and safe environment for your child.  All staff employed by Building Blocks are required to pass necessary background checks to allow them to work in the child care industry, as well as meeting the high expectations that I set for them. Your child will be safe in our doors, and will love spending time with us.  I look forward to working with you and your family to provide the best quality child care that your child deserves.";http://www.buildingblockslebanon.com/;;;;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;http://www.buildingblockslebanon.com/header-2.gif;http://www.buildingblockslebanon.com/interior-4.gif;http://www.buildingblockslebanon.com/interior-3.gif;http://www.buildingblockslebanon.com/December2012-083.gif;http://www.buildingblockslebanon.com/bathroom.gif;;

Over the past year, we have reached benchmarks that demonstrate success. Our organization continues to reflect a commitment to excellence in everything we do. We focus our work in three key areas, because nurturing the potential of children, helping people live halthier and supporting our neighbors are fundamental to strengthening communities. We believe that to bring about meaningful change in individuals and communities, we must be focused and accountable. At the Y, we measure the success of our cause by how well we engage communities in our three areas of focus:
Youth Development: Nurturing the potential of every child and teen.
Healthy Living: Improving the nation's health and well-being.
Social Responsibility: Giving back and providing support to our neighbors.                                                                                       The Y is for everyone. Our programs, services and initiatives enable kids to realize their potential, prepare teens for college, offer ways for families to have fun together, empower people to be healthier in spirit, mind and body, prepare people for employment, welcome and embrace newcomers and help foster a nationwide service ethic. And that's just the beginning.
The Ozarks Regional YMCA is a not-for-profit organization that believes no one should be denied access to membership and/or programs due to the inability to pay. These funds are subsidized through the United Way of the Ozarks and through the Y Annual Campaign.";http://www.orymca.org/;https://www.facebook.com/orymca1;"Mon - Fri:

The school is a licensed, non-profit preschool dedicated to the Christian value.

It is the philosophy of the Loving Hands Preschool and Daycare to give children of our community the opportunity to be cared for in an environment in which they will be given quality care; a place where parents may leave their children without worry or fear.

We believe in valuable education where children can explore their world, where their worth is affirmed, where they learn of their right and the right of others, and where they can rejoice in their environment.

The children enrolled in this program deserve the very best that we have to offer in the terms of development physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, spiritually and cognitively.

While we are a direct ministry outlet of Northside Baptist Church, our focus is not on indoctrinating our students to the way of “Church,” but on teaching them who Jesus Christ is and what He did for them.  Through the lens of Scripture we will prepare your child with the necessary skills and concepts needed for kindergarten.

We will strive to teach Christian values such as love, kindness, caring, sharing, etc.  We will also teach Biblical stories such as creation, Noah’s Ark, the birth of Jesus, etc.  Children can, and in fact should, be taught simple Bible verses to reinforce these values and stories.  Again, our goal is to introduce the joy of learning and to help children discover God’s hand in their world.

We believe that Son-Shine Corner Preschool has been a blessing to our community and has most definitely been a blessing to the Son-Shine staff and Northside Baptist Church.";http://www.sonshinecornerpreschool.com/;https://www.facebook.com/SonShineCornerPreschool/info?tab=page_info;8:30-11:00am ;;;;n;n;y;y;n;n;http://www.sonshinecornerpreschool.com/uploads/7/1/1/4/7114110/1416425379.png;;;;;;

By exposing the children to many different educational experiences, they will increase their understanding of the world as well as develop social skills and build confidence to help in their overall development. We encourage the children to think, problem solve, make decisions and follow through with many hands-on, minds-on experiences. St. Mark's also understands the value of Community.

It is a non-profit religious educational facility that is primarily funded through childcare/tuition receipts, Congregational support and charitable donations. We believe young children benefit immensely from an environment in which they have significant interaction with Christian adults who serve as role models and help them by living and leading a Christian life.

Unique to our campus is a full sized gym that hosts a basketball court, allowing our children the opportunity for indoor free play and organized games. Throughout the week, children can be found doing a multitude of activities from “Duck, Duck, Goose” to Kick-ball.

The curriculum for our Pre-school and Pre-kindergarten classes is “theme based” and Christ-centered in its approach to teaching developmental and academic readiness skills, concepts, and values. Through these programs our teachers encourage their students to be creative in exploring all that God’s world has to offer them.

Our Latchkey program is stocked full of fun. It provides a safe, structured pre and post school environment. It then switches in the summer to a full day summer program that delivers superior hands-on, fun learning experiences.

The Center’s staff is committed to providing a learning program and relevant to each child’s spiritual, physical, emotional and social needs in an atmosphere of personal warmth and supportive love, which stems from our Lord Jesus Christ and His love for children. Greentree Learning and Childcare Center promotes the love of God and others and high moral conduct through our teaching, curriculum, prayers, and play activities. Our program encourages lots of laughter, fun and exercise.

Talented Tots Learning Center exists to provide families with childcare that promotes a safe, nurturing, and educational environment where children grow socially, emotionally, and academically.
Vision
Talented Tots will provide children with the education and experiences needed to assure early success and school readiness. Parent Involvement is critical in the development of a child. We form a partnership with parents by providing weekly newsletters and daily information sheets on what their child has learned each day. We will provide a safe atmosphere where children can learn to communicate and express themselves amongst peers.
Core Values
We value learning and understand that children learn in different ways. We encourage self-esteem and want each child to recognize their strengths and feel confident as they become ready to enter kindergarten. We value respect for every child, family, and staff member.

Our Center's policy is to provide each child with a loving, safe, secure environment with a home away from home atmosphere, a place where they can go each day to grow and learn to the best of their ability. The best part about being family owned and operated, is you become part of that family.

Ages & Stages provides exceptional care for children starting at birth and continues to nurture and educate through 16 years of age.
Our daily schedule includes structured age appropriate pre-school activities, to develop their fine and large motor skills. Along with, sensory, art, language and social development.

Our goal is to provide a safe nurturing environment with a creative based educational curriculum designed to promote learning and exploration in a warm and fun environment. As educators, we are well aware that learning is a life long process for children and teachers alike. Continuing education is a critical component of our program giving our teachers the opportunity to experience, first hand, new theories and practices that they may choose to implement in their classrooms. Parents of children ages 2-5, will be given two assessments each year to help gauge their child's social, physical, emotional and cognitive development.

Our center features controlled access and monitoring cameras in each classroom. We transport to Mount Hope, Westhoff, JLMudd, Forest Park and Assumption. Due to our close proximity to Mount Hope, we transport to its before school clubs.

It is our goal to work jointly with the parent on the child's total development.

 At Overland Christian Church Preschool/Daycare your child will learn the importance of God in his life, and he will learn to respet the beliefs of others.

Appropriate emphasis is placed upon the social, emotional and physical development of the child to encourage a better understanding of himself and his society.

We understand that your child's future is of great importance to you. The kind of person your child will become is determined, in part, by the environment.

Our goal is to develop self-confidence in children through the praise approach.This involves rewarding the children for any and all achievement. We believe this process should begin as soon as your child is capable of understanding and should continue throughout the child's life. After a certain period this becomes part of the child's personality and they become guided primarily from within rather than from without. Every child can be productive and this is conveyed in daily experiences together.";http://www.occpreschool.org/apps/location/;;6:30 - 6:00;http://www.occpreschool.org/employment.htm;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;;http://www.occpreschool.org/photos/undefined/100_4522.JPG;http://www.occpreschool.org/photos/undefined/100_4551.JPG;http://www.occpreschool.org/photos/undefined/100_4512.JPG;http://www.occpreschool.org/photos/undefined/100_4540.JPG;;

We offer a well-balanced program of creative free time and structured learning activities. 

    Our program at Mini School is flexible, but follows a pattern which gives children a feeling of security and sequence.  In a warm, supportive environment, children are given many opportunities for learning through ""doing"" and through play.  Children are able to experience ""successes"", both mentally and physically, in order to inspire confidence and the enjoyment of learning.  The development of social skills is also stressed to promote self-identity and self-worth and to teach respect for the right others.  

    Each day, children enjoy a scheduled variety of lessons and free-choice activities, both indoors and outdoors, group experiences with music and stories, and problem-solving and decision making opportunities that ensure Kindergarten readiness.

St. Paul’s was merely the space rented  by the owner of TreeHouse. 

In 2001, Pastor Keith Karau and St. Paul’s UCC purchased TreeHouse to serve as part of their ministry to the people of Oakville. The name was changed to reflect the church’s involvement with the ministry. A full day “Preschool with Extended Care” option was added to help meet the needs of working families who needed child care. Building on the goal of “Establishing Strong Roots for Future Development,” St. Paul’s eagerly added a Christian component to the already successful program.  

Today, TreeHouse continues its 35 year tradition of a comprehensive, Christian based, early childhood facility, dedicated to providing children and parents with quality education and services. TreeHouse at St. Paul’s is “home away from home” to 150 children, ages 6 weeks through age 12.

You will have mixed emotions. At times you will have feelings of guilt. It is important to remember that a child's parents and family are always the most important influences in their child's ever expanding world. A day care teacher/nurturer should, however, be a dedicated person concerned with the well being of your child's continuous development. The nurturer and environment should encourage and stimulate your child to explore, learn, and to increase his/her confidence in his/her ability to do for himself/herself thus teaching your child to relate effectively with and in his/her surrounding world. The nurturer should do this with a manner and method which provides boundaries and structure enough to provide your child with physical safety and psychological security. Given the security and guidance, your child should be able to grow, explore, and develop in a wholesome, positive manner. ;http://weecaredaycare.biz/;;Monday to Friday  6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.;;;;n;n;y;y;n;n;;http://www.weecaredaycare.biz/nss-folder/pictures/DSC01234.JPG;http://www.weecaredaycare.biz/nss-folder/pictures/DSC01233.JPG;http://www.weecaredaycare.biz/nss-folder/pictures/DSC01224.JPG;http://www.weecaredaycare.biz/nss-folder/pictures/DSC01227.JPG;;

As we grew, we began to recognize that all children have needs, not just medical. We began to identify factors that truly had an impact on children later on in life. We acknowledged that everyone had a unique learning style and by identifying these styles early on, children could compensate for weaknesses and build on strengths. We began to research how sensory input affected our learning. Failure to touch certain objects, or taste certain foods, or engage in a messy play activity limits the child's exploration of their world, thus inhibiting learning later on making it difficult for a child socially, physically, emotionally, and cognitively. We knew that a child's diet affected not only their health, but their growth and development and their potential to learn.  We understood the importance of family involvement and setting limits to provide security and self-confidence.  When parents and adult caregivers are united in guiding children to make wise choices and setting limits,  then the child becomes less confused and more secure. We began to see the importance of prevention and intervention at an early age in order for the child to have a bright and successful future. Hence, Strictly Pediatrics Center, was founded in 1995 to provide children with a solid foundation during the most important years of their life; the early years.

What makes Strictly Pediatrics Center unique, is our approach and our delivery method. In order to identify needs and implement our program, we gathered all the experts.  We have educators, nurses, a developmental therapist, occupational therapists, speech therapists, physical therapists all on staff  and we tap into other experts in the community when needed, such as physician's, educators, dieticians, other therapists, social workers, and other community resources.  We are dedicated to children and to their future and future generations to come. We believe that every child has the potential to do great things and together we can help children succeed.";http://strictlypediatricscenter.com/index.html;; Monday through Friday from 6:30am-6:00pm;;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;;http://strictlypediatricscenter.com/resources/_wsb_423x321_IMG_0806.JPG;http://strictlypediatricscenter.com/resources/_wsb_355x267_martin.jpg;http://strictlypediatricscenter.com/resources/_wsb_348x262_infants.jpg;http://strictlypediatricscenter.com/resources/_wsb_487x363_100_2418.JPG;;

Children who are eligible for kindergarten (turning five before August 1) are not eligible to enroll at SouthSide. With three age groupings guided by the same philosophy and curriculum, we provide continuous care in an accredited center from infancy to preschool graduation. Children may enter the program at any age, depending on availability. Center hours are from 7:15 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., year round (we are closed for 10 holidays per year and professional development days). 
    Our infant and toddler program promotes the healthy development of children painting-smallduring the first three years of life. The infant/toddler classrooms have one teacher for every four children, with a maximum of eight children per classroom.
    Our two’s program accommodates children from 24 to 35 months. This program, also with a one to four ratio, promotes the development of toddlers, emphasizing language and social development, as well as the acquisition of essential cognitive and motor skills for continued achievement in preschool and beyond.
    Our preschool program for ages three through five maintains a teacher:child ratio of one to ten and a maximum group size of 20 in mixed age groups. This program engages children in joyful learning through play with the objective of developing creative problem-solving, strong social skills and curiosity. Ultimately, the goal for preschoolers is to graduate with all the skills needed for success in kindergarten and beyond.

The Head Start approach involves including the parent as the child’s primary educator and getting the entire family and community involved. Since 1965, Head Start has been helping meet children’s needs by offering the following services:

    Health—Medical and dental health screening and follow-up is designed to help children feel their best.

    Nutrition—Head Start serves a nutritious breakfast, lunch and snack and promotes nutrition awareness to help children build strong bodies.

    Parent Involvement/Social Services–Families, whose basic needs are met and who are involved in the lives of their children, provide their children with a wonderful head start in life!

    Education—Our program is designed to meet the social/emotional, intellectual, language and physical needs of children

    Disabilities—Our program is enriched with the presence of others with disabilities.  Least 10% of the children in our program have disabilities.

We believe children learn best when they work at their own pace, using hands-on materials that they can manipulate themselves, and when the environment provides opportunities for movement and self-discovery. Every child is unique and their individuality must be respected throughout the educational process. The Montessori based method is the only educational philosophy that allows each child, as a unique individual, to reach his or her full potential. Children who have had the Montessori based learning experience develop into well-rounded and peaceful individuals with a love for learning.
Stone Village Children's Center continually strives to improve our environment by attending conferences, training sessions and classes. We strive to plan and organize our program to meet the needs of our community and to form a perfect High Quality Montessori Based Natural Learning Facility.";https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stone-Village-Childrens-Center-More/930728923611478?sk=info&tab=page_info;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stone-Village-Childrens-Center-More/930728923611478?sk=info&tab=page_info;Mon: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m., Tue: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m., Wed: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m., Thu: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m., Fri: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m., Sat: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m., Sun: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m.;;;;n;n;y;y;n;n;;https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xft1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/11114144_1024450107572692_1674606428779160307_n.jpg?oh=04f992d3bf7e010f2d79c9af7abc4450&oe=55A9AC19&__gda__=1436513627_50afe9c3b514ee58fc962bc3ba7eba5f;https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xft1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1907651_1024423197575383_667582218510558873_n.jpg?oh=44e477d676339784affcc44b0d03cd49&oe=55AE3D43&__gda__=1441029852_ea555c7e7050798d3cd90701a0f67926;https://scontent-nrt.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/11133740_1024278050923231_3989632925287481832_n.jpg?oh=9c5cb1379cde00418530da6f5386fa73&oe=55A97E01;https://scontent-nrt.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1484698_1022630221088014_2854603035099531770_n.jpg?oh=f6359c480266e2af320d594d8da3a86c&oe=55AE0EA8;;

911395;CREATIVE NURSERY AND PRESCHOOL, LLC;6500 ARSENAL ST;;MO;63109;ST LOUIS CITY;(314) 221-0230;http://www.creativenapstl.com;creativenapstl@me.com;"Creative Nursery and Preschool was established as a response to my own personal search for high-quality, licensed, safe and educational child care for my son in the South St. Louis area.  After searching for months and not finding anything that fulfilled my requirements, I decided to start my own program in order to provide what I felt was lacking in child care in the South St. Louis community.  I started the program in September 2009 in my home with four children in my care, including my own son.  My husband and I finished our basement to create a separate space for the program and I became State-licensed in the summer of 2010.  By November of 2010, I expanded and added four more children to the program and hired my first employees.  Due to overwhelming demand and a desire for an even higher-quality program with more staff resources, we decided to expand to a small center, which opened in August 2012.

At Creative Nursery and Preschool, my goal is to provide a nurturing environment with plenty of individual attention for each child with a focus on learning through play that supports each area of development.  We utilize the Creative Curriculum, which is a research-based, developmentally-appropriate curriculum.  All activities are developmentally appropriate according to the age and abilities of each child.  The children are assessed three times a year using Teaching Strategies Gold, which is a comprehensive assessment tool spanning the major domains of development (Cognitive, Physical, Language, Social-Emotional, Literacy and Mathematics).

Creative Nursery and Preschool is State-licensed and my longer term goal is to become accredited by either the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) or Missouri Accreditation (MOA).  The children have space for active play, activities and rest in a cheerful, clean, organized and comfortable environment that has an intimate, homelike quality.  The children have access to a variety of books, blocks, art materials, puzzles, dramatic play materials, games, musical instruments, and other manipulative toys for fine and gross motor development to ensure learning through play that is developmentally appropriate. The program is completely TV-free.

Parents receive the weekly schedule and menu, as well as a written report at the end of each day detailing daily activities as well as diaper changes/toileting remarks and meals.  Photos are made available via Facebook so families have an idea of what their child experiences throughout the day, although parents can opt-out of having their child included on the Facebook page.  Parents are free to drop-in at any time. We fully support breastfeeding mothers and work with parents who are using cloth diapers.";http://www.creativenapstl.com;https://www.facebook.com/cnapstl;"Mon - Fri:

Our philosophy is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. Reggio Emilia encourages young children and their teachers to explore, question, and discover in a stimulating experience to spark interests and ideas, research for further information, reflect on experience, and form conclusions. Through this process children learn confidence and independents along with the fundamentals necessary for kindergarten. We do this by the incorporation of creative curriculum and project construction.
At Primrose we believe that diet is very important. We make all our meals from scratch. We stay away from refined products and high fructose. 95% of our food is from local businesses and farmers.
Our school is a strong believer in doing our part to help the environment. We use products such as paper towels, art supplies etc... that are made from recycled materials. To prevent the amount of waste, we participate in the Perryville recycle program.

Over the past year, we have reached benchmarks that demonstrate success. Our organization continues to reflect a commitment to excellence in everything we do. We focus our work in three key areas, because nurturing the potential of children, helping people live halthier and supporting our neighbors are fundamental to strengthening communities. We believe that to bring about meaningful change in individuals and communities, we must be focused and accountable. At the Y, we measure the success of our cause by how well we engage communities in our three areas of focus:
Youth Development: Nurturing the potential of every child and teen.
Healthy Living: Improving the nation's health and well-being.
Social Responsibility: Giving back and providing support to our neighbors.                                                                                       The Y is for everyone. Our programs, services and initiatives enable kids to realize their potential, prepare teens for college, offer ways for families to have fun together, empower people to be healthier in spirit, mind and body, prepare people for employment, welcome and embrace newcomers and help foster a nationwide service ethic. And that's just the beginning.
The Ozarks Regional YMCA is a not-for-profit organization that believes no one should be denied access to membership and/or programs due to the inability to pay. These funds are subsidized through the United Way of the Ozarks and through the Y Annual Campaign.";http://www.orymca.org/;https://www.facebook.com/orymca1;"Mon - Fri:

We believe that children can best acquire a rich body of knowledge and the skills needed for future learning through a curriculum that is developmentally appropriate and that builds upon itself year by year. It is our hope that our curriculum is an expression of our mission, which is to develop students with a healthy intellectual, physical, and emotional balance. We want our students to become lifelong learners and ultimately productive citizens in society.

We realize that the first years of a child's academic life are crucial ones in establishing a positive attitude and a disposition toward learning. We value a young child's natural desire to learn through creation and self-expression, and we strive to build upon our students' curiosity, while instilling in them a spirit of cooperation, a respect for others, and a desire to grow intellectually. Therefore, we complement the lessons with weekly participation in library, computer, music, art, and physical education classes.";http://www.wpsd.net/schools/elementary-school;;;https://westplatte.tedk12.com/hire/index.aspx;http://www.wpsd.net/enrollment;http://www.wpsd.net/elementary-handbook/file;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.wpsd.net/images/wplogos/elementarylogo.png;http://www.wpsd.net/images/resized/images/stories/2014-2015/elementary/music/music-040815_281_360.jpg;http://www.wpsd.net/images/resized/images/stories/2014-2015/elementary/es-computers/20150330-maxwell_commercial_410_252.jpg;http://www.wpsd.net/cache/plg_marm/lead/img-0433-art-1719-com_content-qual-80-resized-350x245.jpg;http://www.wpsd.net/images/resized/images/stories/2014-2015/elementary/es-computers/150325-kleman-writes-air-force-01_270_360.jpg;;

Nearly 40 years later, we continue developing new clinical and behavioral health initiatives to help children during one of the most challenging periods of their lives. We thank our supporters for helping ensure children receive the early interventions they need to achieve their full potential.

Our certified teachers and therapists serve approximately 1,000 children per year. We emphasize an inclusive classroom environment in which children with disabilities and typically developing children learn and play together. We provide early intervention services, early childhood education, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and support for parents and siblings. Our new outpatient program, Uncommon Grace Pediatric Therapy, allows families to access life-changing therapies covered by major insurance carriers.

Our programs guide children’s development and nurture their growth. Your child will engage in learning activities designed to meet his or her developmental needs and help him/her advance through lesson plans based on our curriculum. Our teachers enhance the learning process and provide guidance when necessary. The most important goal of our early childhood curriculum is to help children become enthusiastic learners. Our curriculum identifies goals in all areas of development and is part of our daily lesson plans: social/emotional, cognitive, physical, and language. Our goal is help children become independent, self-confident, inquisitive learners. The activities we plan for the children, the way we organize the environment, select toys and materials, plan the daily schedule, and talk with children, are all designed to accomplish the goals for our curriculum and give your child a successful start in school.";http://stphilipsucc.com/early-childhood-center;;;;http://stphilipsucc.com/images/enrollment.pdf;http://stphilipsucc.com/ecc-parent-handbook;y;y;y;y;n;y;http://stphilipsucc.com/images/logo.png;http://stphilipsucc.com/images/outside%20sign.jpg;;;;;

We are pre-denominational, meaning we seek to walk in the original teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. We are Biblical, meaning we respect the teachings of the Bible and believe it is God’s Word. We are evangelistic, meaning we have been impacted by the love of God and desire to see Him transform others. We are community focused, meaning we believe that the New Testament Church can be lived out together and realized in our day. And finally, we are dedicated to the poor, believing that they are the gateway to the kingdom of God.  Our vision is simple but profound: We seek a radical transformation of our culture through the ministry of Christ’s Church. We preach and teach the unfathomable riches of Christ “so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the Church.” (Eph.3:10) When the first Christian community began, “they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers” (Acts 2:42). The way to accomplish this vision has never changed.

Children learn best when they are engaged and interested, and what better way to do that than to have fun while learning. While at our Academy your child will have plenty of time working on teacher directed activities. However learning at Bright Start Academy is also designed to be informal and flexible so the children are allowed to explore, discover and create. It is also varied in nature so the children discover themselves first as individuals, and then relate to others in their group.;www.bsacolumbia.com;;;;http://www.bsacolumbia.com/enrollment/;;y;y;y;y;n;n;;http://www.bsacolumbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/top-slide-1.jpg;http://www.bsacolumbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/top-slide-2.jpg;http://www.bsacolumbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/top-slide-3.jpg;http://www.bsacolumbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/top-slide-4.jpg;;Tuesday

importance of our democratic  way of life in  America.  The preservation  of our democratic way  of life 
shall not be inherited but must always be learned and earned anew by each generation in order for it to 
be perpetuated.
Therefore,  we  believe  the  role  of  education  to  be  one  of  helping  individuals  achieve  their  greatest 
potential which will in turn enable them to make their greatest contribution to society.

ABC’s goal is to give every family that attends our schools a sense of pride and a satisfaction about having their children enrolled with us. We want your children to know how special they are in this world and how special they are to ABC.  Our Center’s policy is to provide each child with a loving, safe, secure environment with a “home away from home” atmosphere- a place where they can go each day to grow and learn to the best of their ability.  ABC provides care for children starting at age 6 weeks and continues to nurture and educate through age 12 years. Our daily schedule includes age appropriate pre-school activities, to develop their fine and large motor skills. Your children will be introduced to a foreign language, creative art, science, math and the latest technology in computers and smart boards. ABC will help the children develop manners, how to share and be nice to their friends while using positive reinforcement in the learning process. ABC Daycare & Learning Center will always put your child and their education first.;http://www.learnatabc.com/abc-locations/;https://www.facebook.com/pages/ABC-Daycare-Learning-Center/218892431457163;;http://www.learnatabc.com/employment/;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;;http://www.learnatabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/infant.png;http://www.learnatabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/toddler_large1.png;http://www.learnatabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/preschool_large.png;http://www.learnatabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/school_age_large.png;;

Jerome Flance, M.D., and his wife Rosemary.  Dr. Flance made legendary contributions to the St. Louis community as a practitioner in private and public health care.  He graduated from Washington University School of Medicine in 1935.

In the 1960s, Dr. Flance opened a free medical clinic in the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood of St. Louis’ urban core with his medical partners in Maryland Medical Group – Drs. Michael Karl, Morton Binder and Robert Packman. He was passionate about giving all children the best possible start in life, regardless of their families’ socioeconomic circumstances. After retiring from clinical practice in 1998, Dr. Flance continued his work in community health care as the Washington University Medical Center’s representative for the redevelopment of the Forest Park Southeast Community.

Dr. Flance died at age 98 in 2010. Prior to his last illness, he helped the project planning team to develop the concept of a center that would address the healthy development of children in a comprehensive way.

Over the past year, we have reached benchmarks that demonstrate success. Our organization continues to reflect a commitment to excellence in everything we do. We focus our work in three key areas, because nurturing the potential of children, helping people live halthier and supporting our neighbors are fundamental to strengthening communities. We believe that to bring about meaningful change in individuals and communities, we must be focused and accountable. At the Y, we measure the success of our cause by how well we engage communities in our three areas of focus:
Youth Development: Nurturing the potential of every child and teen.
Healthy Living: Improving the nation's health and well-being.
Social Responsibility: Giving back and providing support to our neighbors.                                                                                       The Y is for everyone. Our programs, services and initiatives enable kids to realize their potential, prepare teens for college, offer ways for families to have fun together, empower people to be healthier in spirit, mind and body, prepare people for employment, welcome and embrace newcomers and help foster a nationwide service ethic.
