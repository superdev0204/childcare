Duplin County was awarded Smart Start funding as a “Year 2” partnership (received program dollars in the second round of funding approved by the North Carolina Legislature. The Board of Directors and committees spent many long hours working to develop a plan that included several programs and services to best serve the needs of Duplin County children birth through five, and their families. This plan was put into action with many public and private organizations working together. From those early beginnings, Smart Start has helped to prepare children to enter kindergarten healthier and prepared to be successful. Much has changed since those days. A high set of standards called Performance Base Incentive System (PBIS) have been developed which focus on quality preschool education through programs including early intervention, quality enhancement of childcare facilities, higher education for teachers, increased stability of the early childhood workforce, family support and financial assistance for childcare. The Partnership continues to work with other organizations to implement programs that ensure success of children and families.";"Training and Technical Assistance for Providers; Child Care Program Licensing and Registration; Literacy Programs; Parent Workshops";"Duplin County";;"Mon - Fri: 8:00am - 4:30pm";
