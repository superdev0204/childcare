High-quality early childhood care and education remains our chosen path to this vision. This is the collective vision of Crystal Stairs, Inc. that guides us as we look to improve the lives of families through child care services, research and advocacy. Through the efforts of our board, staff and many professional and community partners, Crystal Stairs programs and services enhance the quality of life for thousands of children and families in Los Angeles every day. Helping a parent find child care, training child care providers on how to nurture and educate young children, helping parents and providers bridge the affordability gap with child care subsidies, and teaching a child to use a computer are just part of what we do. We help families to succeed, children to learn, and child care providers to be competent, confident caregivers. Our program funding comes primarily from government contracts and a growing number of foundations and donors. Inevitably, we continue to face the ever-increasing challenges of fiscal constraints and competing priorities. We must enhance our efforts to advocate for programs and funding that help our children learn and grow safely, intelligently and inquisitively throughout their young years. And to survive and thrive as an organization, we must work with efficient technology and use the growing array of electronic communication tools to bring others to our journey. We are proud of the fact that we have continued to fulfill our mission, and we look forward to your support for many years to come.

Co-founders Patty Siegel and Martha Roditti began by organizing neighborhood playgroups in response to the growing community need for full-time child care. In 1975 and 1976, with significant support from both the Rosenberg Foundation and the Ford Foundation, Children's Council was able to expand its services and begin building its comprehensive list of licensed child care throughout San Francisco. After the federal welfare-to-work child care program was introduced in 1996 (CalWorks in California), Children's Council expanded to meet the needs of working families, quadrupling in size in a few years. Under the leadership of Executive Director Dr. Linnea Klee, Children's Council added many innovative programs serving the needs of San Francisco's children, families and child care community. Children's Council continues these hallmark programs today.

With the oversight of the Florida Partnership for School Readiness, local communities were given the authority to bring together local leaders to vision and plan for the future by focusing resources where they are most effective, the needs of children birth to five years. In 2000, Escambia County created a local school readiness coalition under the guidance and direction of community leaders who saw a vision for Escambia's children. As a result, the strengths of multiple programs have blended into a system that meets the needs of working families, the needs of school readiness for young children and the needs of a growing business economy to create a literate workforce. Children who enter school prepared to learn have the best chance of completing their education with the necessary competencies to become productive citizens. A constitutional amendment passed by Florida’s voters in Nov. 2002 required a voluntary prekindergarten program for all four-year-old children by fall 2005. House Bill 1-A was signed into law by Governor Bush on January 2, 2005, creating a program designed to prepare four-year-olds for kindergarten and build the foundation for their educational success. The program allows a parent to enroll his or her eligible child (four years old by September 1 and residing in Florida) in a free VPK program. The program is voluntary for children and providers. The first VPK classes began in the 2005-2006 school year. Public, private, and faith-based providers may be eligible to deliver the program depending on whether they meet the minimum standards required in law. The first summer VPK program was offered in 2006. Children may participate in the summer VPK program the summer immediately before the school year for which the child is eligible for kindergarten. We are able to reach our goals with the support of the local early education community which includes: Childcare Centers, Pre-Kindergarten programs, Head Start, Family Child Care Homes, and Faith-based providers.";"Child Care Resource and Referral; Subsidy Childcare; VPK Program; Provider Support";"Escambia County";"http://www.elcescambia.org/image/elc-logo.jpg";"Mon - Thurs: 7:30am - 5:30pm";
