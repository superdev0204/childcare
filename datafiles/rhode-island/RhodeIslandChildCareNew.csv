Central Falls is one square mile that borders Providence. The school provides an inclusive preschool experience for any preschool age child with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) in Central Falls. Approximately twenty percent of the preschool age students at MI Robertson have an IEP. Eighteen preschool students in total are chosen through the State of Rhode Island Pre-Kindergarten lottery for the DUAL LANGUAGE PREK class at MI Robertson. Approximately another 200 preschool students are chosen for full or half day programs at Captain Hunt School which is the other public early learning center that is part of the Central Falls public schools. Fifty four spaces at Captain Hunt School are filled by students who are chosen through the Department of Education lottery. The other spaces are chosen with the same protocol and systems as the State of Rhode Island Pre- Kindergarten program lottery but facilitated by the district of Central Falls itself.    Our school is a safe and nurturing environment that respects and embraces cultural, economic, and ethnic diversity. The MI Robertson DUAL LANGUAGE PREK professional community work in conjunction with the Captain Hunt School professional community to meet the academic, social, emotional and physical needs of all children who participate in the program. Approximately 200 students attend the preschool program at Captain Hunt School and another 18 students are enrolled in the DUAL LANGUAGE PREK at MI Robertson. All children and families who reside in Central Falls are welcome to apply for the program. All families interested in the program are given tours and information. Children screened by Central Falls Outreach Team who are determined eligible for an Individualized Education Plan (IEP)/services at Captain Hunt School or MI Robertson School are given a program at Captain Hunt School or MI Robertson Elementary in alignment with their needs. Students not eligible for a program/classroom at Captain Hunt School or MI Robertson School are placed in a database reflective of the system used by the State Pre-Kindergarten Program at the Department of Education. When spaces become available, the computer generates a randomized list in order for all families interested to have equal opportunity for the program. The Department of Education funds 3 all day Pre-Kindergarten classes at Captain Hunt School and 1 at MI Robertson School. RIDE chose the names of the students who will participate in the 3 classrooms at Captain Hunt School and the DUAL LANGUAGE PREK at MI Robertson School. Those names are chosen from applications that are submitted to their system after parents complete and submit the application to the Captain Hunt School, MI Robertson School and/or the Central Falls Public School District.  Many of the children and families speak other languages at home but most of the children speak Spanish. Each classroom at Captain Hunt School has at least one teacher or Teacher Assistant who speaks Spanish in order to communicate with children and families. All 3 Teachers in the MI Robertson School DUAL LANGUAGE PREK are bi-lingual. (Spanish.) Teachers all have the Department of Education's certification to be an Early Childhood Teacher in a public school in Rhode Island.  Teachers are trained in working with English Language Learners and four early childhood  teachers have certification from the Department of Education in order to be teachers of English Language Learners.    Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson Schools are proud to welcome children who may have special needs. Those special needs include  developmental delays and disabilities, mental health diagnosis, behavioral challenges and physical challenges. Special Education services at Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson School are available to all students and families who have residence in our city, without exception.    We believe that every child is unique and valued and so, as a school, every effort is made to provide special education services to children within their general education environment here in Central Falls. That happens at Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson School. Depending upon the classroom community, certified special education teachers consult with general education teachers as needed. Sometimes, special educators provide direct service to students within the child's classroom, as appropriate/determined by a child's Individualized Education Plan. Five Speech Therapists, a Psychologist, a Guidance Counselor, a Social Worker, an Occupational Therapist and a Physical Therapist also provide support to children and families at Captain Hunt School  and MI Robertson School as needed/determined by Individualized Education Plan. A full-time Home School Liaison also provide information, resources, connections, collaboration, support and translation as needed ~to families as they navigate Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson School as their child's first public school experience.";"8:15am - 2:30pm";"8:15am - 2:30pm";"8:15am - 2:30pm";"8:15am - 2:30pm";"8:15am - 2:30pm";;;"3 - 5 years"

Our school is a safe and nurturing environment that respects and embraces cultural, economic, and ethnic diversity. The MI Robertson DUAL LANGUAGE PREK professional community work in conjunction with the Captain Hunt School professional community to meet the academic, social, emotional and physical needs of all children who participate in the program. Approximately 200 students attend the preschool program at Captain Hunt School and another 18 students are enrolled in the DUAL LANGUAGE PREK at MI Robertson. All children and families who reside in Central Falls are welcome to apply for the program. All families interested in the program are given tours and information. Children screened by Central Falls Outreach Team who are determined eligible for an Individualized Education Plan (IEP)/services at Captain Hunt School or MI Robertson School are given a program at Captain Hunt School or MI Robertson Elementary in alignment with their needs. Students not eligible for a program/classroom at Captain Hunt School or MI Robertson School are placed in a database reflective of the system used by the State Pre-Kindergarten Program at the Department of Education. When spaces become available, the computer generates a randomized list in order for all families interested to have equal opportunity for the program. The Department of Education funds 3 all day Pre-Kindergarten classes at Captain Hunt School and 1 at MI Robertson School. RIDE chose the names of the students who will participate in the 3 classrooms at Captain Hunt School and the DUAL LANGUAGE PREK at MI Robertson School. Those names are chosen from applications that are submitted to their system after parents complete and submit the application to the Captain Hunt School, MI Robertson School and/or the Central Falls Public School District.  Many of the children and families speak other languages at home but most of the children speak Spanish. Each classroom at Captain Hunt School has at least one teacher or Teacher Assistant who speaks Spanish in order to communicate with children and families. All 3 Teachers in the MI Robertson School DUAL LANGUAGE PREK are bi-lingual. (Spanish.) Teachers all have the Department of Education's certification to be an Early Childhood Teacher in a public school in Rhode Island.  Teachers are trained in working with English Language Learners and four early childhood  teachers have certification from the Department of Education in order to be teachers of English Language Learners.    Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson Schools are proud to welcome children who may have special needs. Those special needs include  developmental delays and disabilities, mental health diagnosis, behavioral challenges and physical challenges. Special Education services at Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson School are available to all students and families who have residence in our city, without exception.    We believe that every child is unique and valued and so, as a school, every effort is made to provide special education services to children within their general education environment here in Central Falls. That happens at Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson School. Depending upon the classroom community, certified special education teachers consult with general education teachers as needed. Sometimes, special educators provide direct service to students within the child's classroom, as appropriate/determined by a child's Individualized Education Plan. Five Speech Therapists, a Psychologist, a Guidance Counselor, a Social Worker, an Occupational Therapist and a Physical Therapist also provide support to children and families at Captain Hunt School  and MI Robertson School as needed/determined by Individualized Education Plan. A full-time Home School Liaison also provide information, resources, connections, collaboration, support and translation as needed ~to families as they navigate Captain Hunt School and MI Robertson School as their child's first public school experience.";"8:45am - 3:00pm";"8:45am - 3:00pm";"8:45am - 3:00pm";"8:45am - 3:00pm";"8:45am - 3:00pm";;;"3 - 5 years"

Those are the values that The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island stands for. Demand for daycare facilities continue to grow day by day, but all too often, institutions are only able to focus on either allowing the child to enjoy their childhood and develop naturally or forcing the child to focus only on mental development in order to achieve high test scores later on in life.         The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island is different. We promote physical activities in large open areas and a wide variety of educational games, but we also have a small library and various arts and crafts for your child to unleash his or her full creative and intellectual potential.         Our goal is to promote every child's development individually using an appropriate mix of academic and recreational activities.      When it comes to your kids, nothing less than the highest standards will do. Our institution provides a safe environment for your child to explore his or her full potential. If you're looking for a daycare center that meets these stringent demands, look no further!           The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island is family owned and operated, providing for the learning needs of Rhode Island based families. Our centers provide essential care for children from six weeks to twelve years of age. ELC of RI was created in order to establish a safe and happy learning environment for children of all school ages and backgrounds. Our setting not only teaches essential developmental skills, but also allows your child to experience the joy and thrill of learning through play. Our staff uses years of education and first hand experience to produce the highest standard of learning for your child, while still achieving the heightened levels of fun and happiness sought by young minds. The current goal of the owner is to continuously upgrade all centers and provide additional programs while providing child care to the families at the same cost as other local centers. The owner knows that families want the best for their children even during these hard economic times. He hopes that by improving our current centers and keeping tuition at reasonable rates, it will not only help the financial situation of our families, but also the overall economy of our great state. Our goal is to provide the best child care, and daycare at the best possible price. This is the very reason our motto is &quot;The Best Care, for the Best Price!&quot; Stop by our centers and meet our staff, and you will see we truly are a family run business. May all of our families and our courageous troops both home and abroad have a safe and happy year.";"6:30am - 6:00pm";"6:30am - 6:00pm";"6:30am - 6:00pm";"6:30am - 6:00pm";"6:30am - 6:00pm";;;"2 months - 4 years, 3 - 5 years, 5+ years"

Those are the values that The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island stands for. Demand for daycare facilities continue to grow day by day, but all too often, institutions are only able to focus on either allowing the child to enjoy their childhood and develop naturally or forcing the child to focus only on mental development in order to achieve high test scores later on in life.         The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island is different. We promote physical activities in large open areas and a wide variety of educational games, but we also have a small library and various arts and crafts for your child to unleash his or her full creative and intellectual potential.         Our goal is to promote every child's development individually using an appropriate mix of academic and recreational activities.      When it comes to your kids, nothing less than the highest standards will do. Our institution provides a safe environment for your child to explore his or her full potential. If you're looking for a daycare center that meets these stringent demands, look no further!           The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island is family owned and operated, providing for the learning needs of Rhode Island based families. Our centers provide essential care for children from six weeks to twelve years of age. ELC of RI was created in order to establish a safe and happy learning environment for children of all school ages and backgrounds. Our setting not only teaches essential developmental skills, but also allows your child to experience the joy and thrill of learning through play. Our staff uses years of education and first hand experience to produce the highest standard of learning for your child, while still achieving the heightened levels of fun and happiness sought by young minds. The current goal of the owner is to continuously upgrade all centers and provide additional programs while providing child care to the families at the same cost as other local centers. The owner knows that families want the best for their children even during these hard economic times. He hopes that by improving our current centers and keeping tuition at reasonable rates, it will not only help the financial situation of our families, but also the overall economy of our great state. Our goal is to provide the best child care, and daycare at the best possible price. This is the very reason our motto is &quot;The Best Care, for the Best Price!&quot; Stop by our centers and meet our staff, and you will see we truly are a family run business. May all of our families and our courageous troops both home and abroad have a safe and happy year.

Those are the values that The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island stands for. Demand for daycare facilities continue to grow day by day, but all too often, institutions are only able to focus on either allowing the child to enjoy their childhood and develop naturally or forcing the child to focus only on mental development in order to achieve high test scores later on in life.         The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island is different. We promote physical activities in large open areas and a wide variety of educational games, but we also have a small library and various arts and crafts for your child to unleash his or her full creative and intellectual potential.         Our goal is to promote every child's development individually using an appropriate mix of academic and recreational activities.      When it comes to your kids, nothing less than the highest standards will do. Our institution provides a safe environment for your child to explore his or her full potential. If you're looking for a daycare center that meets these stringent demands, look no further!           The Early Learning Centers of Rhode Island is family owned and operated, providing for the learning needs of Rhode Island based families. Our centers provide essential care for children from six weeks to twelve years of age. ELC of RI was created in order to establish a safe and happy learning environment for children of all school ages and backgrounds. Our setting not only teaches essential developmental skills, but also allows your child to experience the joy and thrill of learning through play. Our staff uses years of education and first hand experience to produce the highest standard of learning for your child, while still achieving the heightened levels of fun and happiness sought by young minds. The current goal of the owner is to continuously upgrade all centers and provide additional programs while providing child care to the families at the same cost as other local centers. The owner knows that families want the best for their children even during these hard economic times. He hopes that by improving our current centers and keeping tuition at reasonable rates, it will not only help the financial situation of our families, but also the overall economy of our great state. Our goal is to provide the best child care, and daycare at the best possible price. This is the very reason our motto is &quot;The Best Care, for the Best Price!&quot; Stop by our centers and meet our staff, and you will see we truly are a family run business.

We will utilize assessments to celebrate and create goals for your child.   Our program focuses on socialization, education, and development of all children in both formal and informal activities.  Our program includes creative dramatics, arts and crafts, singing, finger plays, music and movement, story time, gross and fine motor development and outdoor play activities.    We incorporate a monthly theme with our activities.  We send out a monthly newsletter to keep the parents informed of what their children are learning and anything else that may be happening with the child care, such as a special event, field trip or birthdays.   Communication with the parents is very important to us.  You are your childвЂ™s first teacher and you give your child their first experience with relationships and learning.  You as parents can support and extend the work of the child care when your child is at home.  We encourage you to contact the child care with any concerns or questions that may arise.  A continual interaction with the parents and staff helps to maintain a combined effort to bring about the best results.  It is our sincere hope that your childвЂ™s child care experience will be positive and enriching.";"7:30am - 5:00pm";"7:30am - 5:00pm";"7:30am - 5:00pm";"7:30am - 5:00pm";"7:30am - 5:00pm";;;"All age groups"

It was established in 1992 as a ministry of the Faith Presbyterian Church.  As an evangelical church, Faith Presbyterian Church has long been involved in outreach programs to bring spiritual and practical help to those in need and members of the community.  In June 2013, Faith Nursery School Incorporated as an independent Christian preschool becoming non profit corporation.  Faith Nursery School continues to uphold the tradition of a uniquely Christian pre-school.    The curriculum is an emergent curriculum based on childrenвЂ™s needs and interests and aligns with the RI Early Learning and Development Standards and NAEYC criteria.  The pre-school is a gentle step between home and the outside world.  In a happy relaxed atmosphere, the child is encouraged to create, explore, discover and experiment.  With the support   of sensitive teachers a child can learn to cope with frustrations as well as the satisfactions that are derived from interacting with other young children.    The primary goal of Faith Nursery School is to foster in each child a positive self-image.  The teachers are convinced that in order to learn, a child must feel good about himself.  Each day the children enjoy opportunities, which can contribute to positive feelings of self worth.  Art expression, problem solving, learning new skills, and learning to be independent are among some of the most valuable.  We endeavor to continue this goal all year long.    Another important aspect of the program is to provide a Christian atmosphere that allows a child to feel loved and secure in a healthy and appropriate environment.    Faith Nursery School is a comfortable, joyful place where young children can learn to get along with others, develop independence and learn about their own feelings.  Thus, we feel it provides a successful beginning school experience.  ";"8:30am - 1:00pm";"8:30am - 1:00pm";"8:30am - 1:00pm";"8:30am - 1:00pm";"8:30am - 1:00pm";;;"3 - 5 years"

Greenwood Montessori School is committed to guiding children physically, spiritually, academically and socially as they grow in age, wisdom and grace.  We encourage an atmosphere of trust, kindness and respect and endeavor to nurture each childвЂ™s independence, love of learning, and positive sense of self and others.  Greenwood Montessori School, a private preschool in Rhode Island, is a non-denominational Christian community that aims to foster competent, responsible, adaptive citizens who are life-long learners and problem-solvers.  In addition, we seek to help children gain an understanding of God, according to their curiosity and needs and to see their important role both in the classroom and in the world.  We welcome children of all racial, cultural, religious and economic backgrounds and do not discriminate on the basis of such in our admissions process.  We believe in the importance of parental involvement in support of childrenвЂ™s development and learning and are, therefore, open to suggestions, new ideas and continual growth.  Educational Philosophy. Greenwood Montessori School, a private Rhode Island preschool, was established on the belief that children between birth and age six develop at a rate that will never again be duplicated in their lifetime.  Once these precious years have passed, so has an enormous potential for learning.  Our educational philosophy is based on the work of Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952), an Italian physician and educator.  She was one of the first to see the early years of life as crucial to the future growth and functioning of the individual.  In her writings, Dr. Montessori frequently compared the young mind to a sponge, literally absorbing information from their environment.  Since children go through вЂњsensitive periodsвЂќ where they exhibit an inner drive to understand certain concepts, it is the teacherвЂ™s role to detect these sensitive periods and prepare the environment for each childвЂ™s learning.  Children have a natural curiosity and will learn new concepts through concrete, hands-on activities.  Play is childrenвЂ™s вЂњworkвЂќ and one of the most effective teachers.  Unlike many traditional preschools in Rhode Island, Greenwood Montessori School views all children as individuals and exposes them to meaningful learning experiences where they are allowed to educate themselves at their own developmental level.  Children in control of their own learning build confidence in themselves and are then willing to take on lifeвЂ™s challenges and become successful in future endeavors.  WhatвЂ™s So Different About Montessori? A great deal of the appeal of a Montessori education is visual:  when observing a program in action, it is obvious something out of the ordinary is taking place.  The colorful materials displayed attractively on the shelves catch the eye immediately.  Groups of children working together cooperatively throughout the morning lend to the calm and peaceful classroom atmosphere.  The difficult-to-locate teacher, using a soft voice in a gentle but firm and respectful manner, may be different from what one would find in other classrooms.  Easily understood is the idea of an enriched environment, producing children whose lives are enriched by вЂњworkingвЂќ in them.  When a Montessori classroom is well tuned, the children begin to make discoveries.  These discoveries, along with an atmosphere that encourages individual interests, fuel an emotional relationship with knowledge.  The Classroom Environment. The class consists of a mixed-aged grouping of children 2 years, 9 months through 5 years of age, enabling the children to help and learn from each other and to develop at their own pace without the pressure of competition.  Dr. Montessori learned through her observations that children are happiest in a prepared environment.  Greenwood Montessori SchoolвЂ™s environment is prepared by a trained teacher and is designed to challenge, intrigue and delight young children while developing their talents.  Both the young childвЂ™s interest in the environment itself and the older childвЂ™s growing awareness of the abstract are nurtured in the Montessori classroom.  The Curriculum.  Greenwood Montessori School's curriculum guides children through hands-on activities that develop a life-long love of learning.  Independence, concentration, coordination, respect, a sense of order and problem-solving skills form the foundation.  Math, reading, science, art, music and movement, communication, social, emotional and physical development excel once this foundation has been laid.  The three-strand curriculum of (1) practical life skills (motor and social development), (2) sensory skills (refinement of the five senses) and (3) academic skills (math, read, writing, science, geography, etc.) provide for a unique educational balance and allow each child endless opportunities for self-education.  The Teacher.  The real teacher in the Montessori classroom is the child himself/herself.  It is the child who leads the way, revealing what s/he most needs to work on.  Thus, the Montessori teacher operates much differently than the traditional teacher.  S/he does not set goals and schedules for the children in the classroom and then use rewards and punishments to influence them to conform.  Rather, s/he begins by familiarizing herself/himself to the needs of the children through observation.  S/he becomes aware of the direction in which the child wants to go ~ seeking ways to help ~ but never infringing upon the child's freedom to make his/her own discoveries.  Programs &amp; Admissions.  Two, three and five-day programs are available in our Toddler Program to children ages 18 months through 3 years. Three and five-day programs are available in our Primary Program to children ages  3-6. All children in the Primary Class should be toiled trained. The Montessori program, whether at our school or any other true Montessori school, is most successful when there is a multi-year commitment from families whose children begin as three-year-olds.  While we do not require parents to sign a multi-year contract, we do hope that parents are choosing a Montessori program because they believe in the philosophy and the benefits of the continuous journey.  Interested families are invited to call 739-1191 to schedule a classroom observation.";"8:30am - 3:00pm";"8:30am - 3:00pm";"8:30am - 3:00pm";"8:30am - 3:00pm";"8:30am - 3:00pm";;;"3 - 5 years, 1 - 4 years"
