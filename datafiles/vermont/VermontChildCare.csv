Children    are encouraged to resolve conflicts with each other by using words to    express their feelings rather than using aggressive behaviors.

In creating this environment, I provide many opportunities for children to explore, create and have fun. The children are encouraged to participate in daily art and hands on activities, story time, free play, outdoor play and exploration as well as other enriching activities.

The curriculum consists of individual and group    plans for learning experiences through which children acquire    knowledge, skills, abilities, and understanding. The implementation of    developmentally appropriate practices and curriculum supports children    to achieve goals that are meaningful. Lesson plans are culturally and    linguistically responsive and developmentally and educationally    significant. Through fun learning experiences that reflect what is    known about children and about each child in particular and Teachers    provide windows on the world so that children learn about themselves,    their families, their community, peoples, places, arts, sciences, and    more. We support diverse and inclusive learning communities. The    curriculum is planned with coordinated efforts so that children's ,    knowledge and skills are developed in a coherent, aligned manner    building on what was learned previously to foster a positive learning    disposition in each area of the curriculum and in each child.    Intentionally planned lessons are combined with the use of emergent    curriculum based on children's interests and experiences that is    aligned with Vermont learning standards.Teachers provide flexibility    to adapt lessons and activities to meet the interests to create fun    and meaningful learning experiences for each group and individual    child. NB Children's Center, Inc. guides child behavior based on best    practice and encourages self-control, self-esteem, and respect for all    children and adults. We plan for positive guidance and redirection in    our classrooms by establishing predictable routines, setting clear    rules, and modeling kindness and respect throughout our day. NB    Children's Center, Inc. actively plans for guidance, which keeps a    positive climate in our classrooms and enhances each child's success    as a learner. This approach to behavior guidance supports building    strong, caring and trusting relationships with children and families.    We believe that oftentimes behavior concerns usually indicate that a    child needs more time, support, and practice to develop their social    emotional and other skills. When serious concerns arise, teachers    maintain observations and documentation of the outcomes of the    behavior concerns. A family conference may be requested to share    resources to address specific behaviors and plan jointly with the    family to develop appropriate intervention strategies for school and    home settings. Referrals to access specialized developmental educators    may be made with permission from the family to further support a    child's social and emotional health.";"NB Children's Center Inc believes that each and every child has the right to equitable learning opportunities that fully support their optimal development and learning across all domains and content areas. Children are born eager to learn; they take delight in exploring their world and making connections. We support engagement in developmentally appropriate practices to foster young children's joyful learning and maximize the opportunities for each and every child to achieve their full potential. NB Children's Center Inc's philosophy stems from the knowledge that children learn and grow in predictable stages throughout childhood. At each developmental stage, new skills and understandings are emerging. At the same time, we also know that despite this sequence, all children are individuals and have individual characteristics from birth which make each child special and unique. Development always occurs within the context of each child's unique potential. The Center functions on the belief that all children shall be provided enhanced connections and therefore we believe that every family is our partner. We partner with families to ensure each child develops to their optimal ability within a responsive and nurturing learning community.We provide highly qualified and well-trained early care and afterschool education professionals to provide a variety of exceptional learning experiences in a responsive and trauma informed environment.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";;"No";"Yes";;"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";;;"Full-Time, Part-Time";;"In-Service Days";"07:00:00 to 16:30:00";"Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;"Allergy Awareness, Special Diets";"1 Star";;446586

At Neighborhood    Schoolhouse we believe in careful teaching of all behavioral    expectations, using clear, age-appropriate language. We offer    encouragement for positive growth, to help guide children into    positive, pro-social behavior.";"Children spend a great deal of time outside on our expansive playground and in our forest spaces. We have a dedicated music and arts teacher who visits each classroom throughout the week. Circle time, sensory activities, free play, and seasonal themes are explored in the classroom. Children have a morning snack, lunch, and an afternoon snack. All children are given the opportunity to rest in the afternoon and children who take a short rest are invited outside for calm exploration. The Neighborhood Schoolhouse is primarily informed by the RIE approach, Vygotsky, Progressive Education, Restorative Practices, and Gentle/Respectful communication. We offer programs for children ages 6 weeks through 5 years. The Neighborhood Schoolhouse preschool is a creative, playful, emotionally responsive program. Children are encouraged to explore their ideas about the world through play. Story-telling, cooking and art projects, dance and exploring the natural world are important parts of our curriculum. Our daily routine includes circle time, art or craft activities, dramatic play, sand and water play, songs or music activities, story time and literacy activities.

Responsive: We believe that careful observation and attention in all our interactions leads to authentic and intentional responses. Respectful: We believe that all people- children, families, caregivers, colleagues- deserve respect. We recognize and value our unique perspectives, differences, and commonalities. In our interactions, we strive to try to understand each other, to build on strengths, and assume competence no matter the age. Reflective: We believe that reflection begins with curiosity. Reflective practitioners try to understand, ask questions, and remain open to feedback and change.

I teach the children how to respect each other, to sit and eat as a family at the table, on how to use the utensil, also eating healthy, and how it's important for the body, we learn about, letters, shapes, color, and numbers, we do circle time, with music, we learn in Spanish and English as Spanish is my first language, we do a lot of our learning through play, we do a lot of baking and often times make our own scrambled eggs, cut our vegetables, great walks to the parks near us and wonderful; walks in the Ethan Allen park (woods). We like to build things, we like to pick blueberries and raspberries in our neighborhood. We go outside twice a da,. We nap from 1 to 3 after our breakfast.

In early childhood,    children are developing social and emotional skills and learning    behavioral expectations. These skills are taught over time and require    LOTS of practice, just like reading and math skills. Some children    need extra support in working on challenging behavior. By this we mean    behavior that isn?t working for the child, occurs often, and impacts    their ability to learn and play. We work with children to help them    have better self-control. We use positive methods to do this. We    might: Teach skills by using songs, books, games and reminders...Show    them how to behave...Redirect them to a better activity...Set    limits...Let them know what will happen if they keep doing something    they should not be doing...Provide the space or time needed to get    back in control...CVHS does not suspend, expel, reduce hours or send    children home because .......";"In Head Start, our goal is to help your child grow and develop. We know that you are your child?s first and most important teacher. We believe that young children learn best when they play. Children learn by exploring, trying new things and asking questions. When children play, they use their imaginations, bodies, power of choice, and problem solving skills. This helps them to become good learners. In Head Start we focus on areas of child development: 1. Social and emotional...2. Different ways to learn...3. Language and Literacy...4. Physical development...5. Logic and reasoning...6.English (if your family?s main language is not English)... Children and staff like to be outdoors in all kinds of weather. Children go outside every day, unless it is too cold (risk of frostbite), or there is a thunderstorm.

Children will learn self    help skills and independence through hands on experiences and will    learn to cooperate and be part of a larger childcare family by    enhancing social skills. Guidance Techniques: * Active Listening-    encourages expressing a childs feelings. * Negotiation- helping    children solve problems/conflicts * Setting limits- keeping children    safe by having clear guidelines * Modifying the environment- making    changes to the environment as necessary to meet the needs of the    children in care. * Facilitating- helping children solve problems by    assisting them with communicating with their peers. * Reinforcement-    ensuring that children feel important and valued. Acknowledging    helpful, kind and empathetic actions. * Redirect- direct a childs    attention to another activity and seeing a problem before it arises.    When challenging behavior arises, it is handled in a positive manner    by working with the child using the above Guidance Techniques. If    persistent behavior challenges continue, communication with the    parent/guardian shall be done to ensure that the child is receiving    consistency between childcare and home.

Lunchboxes should have icepacks to keep food cool throughout the day. Children should also pack their own utensils to be sent home for cleaning daily. Communication with Families: Communication is essential in fostering a healthy, strong relationship.. I believe that both parents and caregivers have a large stake in every childs success. Within my program I like to create an environment that parents are a welcome part of the program. I firmly believe in open communication with all parents and respect confidentiality. I welcome parents to become involved with the program by sharing ideas and suggestions in regards to modifying or enhancing the curriculum. Parents are always welcome to participate in activities and are always welcome in my home. Parent education is important and I encourage you to ask questions regarding your childs activity, nutrition, growth and development. I provide a variety of parent resources. A parent board is posted in the mudroom and will contain important information regarding any child care information as well as parenting and family resources.

This is called Active Supervision. For more information about    Active Supervision protocol, please consult your Head Start Parent    Handbook. We work with children in a manner that respects their    individuality while also developing social skills such as sharing,    working together and being a friend.

Our classroom environments are    intentionally designed to promote positive interactions. When    challenges arise we start with looking at how the child interacts with    the environment and classroom peers. We understand that behaviors    often occur when a childs needs aren't being met. It is our mission    to get to the root of these needs by encouraging children to    communicate with their words while providing them with the proper    language to do so. We often employ humor and lightheartedness as a way    to help children manage their emotions. When children have developed    language skills, we work with them on labeling emotions and finding    peaceful ways to express those emotions through music, gross motor    activities, and offer calm spaces for alone time. We do not believe in    giving children time out, as this only acts as a temporary solution.    Instead, we encourage children to talk through their emotions,    communicate with peers and teachers, channel their energy into another    activity, or take independent space in the classroom. We believe    strongly in supporting childrens social and emotional development and    follow developmentally appropriate expectations for behavior and    communication. Our goal is to guide children in developing self    regulation skills, communicating effectively, and finding solutions.    Teachers are available to support children in solving their problems    offering guidance as needed. Staff are always willing to meet with    families regarding positive approaches to challenging behaviors, but    please keep in mind that we will keep the behavior of other children    confidential. If a childs behavior causes imminent harm, we will    employ the use of coping strategies, outside agency support, and    communication with all team members to support the child in the    classroom. If these behaviors continue after such support is put in    place, we may ask your child to leave with five days' notice as    aligned with Vermont Child Care Licensing Regulations and Agency of    Education suspension and expulsion regulations.";"OZ Full Circle Preschool is the way Ohavi Zedek cares for and nurtures the youngest in our community. We offer high-quality, nurturing, holistic care from Birth to Pre-Kindergarten age in five classrooms. Our program centers on child- led learning and exploration, along with Jewish values of kindness, generosity, and community from the youngest ages. OZs Full Circle Preschool is Jewish in content, character, and calendar, while also whole-heartedly welcoming interfaith, non-affiliated, and non-Jewish students and families. Inclusion, warmth, and kindness are the foundation of all we do. At OZ Full Circle Preschool, we embrace a Reggio-Emilia inspired emergent curriculum. We respect the childs need to generate their own questions and aim to help children make sense of their experiences. Using the project-based approach, we encourage teachers, children, family, and other members of the community to collaborate in ongoing projects based on the childrens interests. Childrens work is deeply respected, and is used by educators and families to better understand childrens development and thinking processes. Children are fully supported in their expressive and creative endeavors. Children are encouraged to reflect on their work and the work of others, and to lend words and meaning to their creative processes. We believe strongly in providing children with inviting spaces that encourage creativity and exploration. We believe that in order to provide children with opportunities for independent and collaborative learning, we must ask open-ended questions and provide children with the proper language and materials to further explore their innate curiosities. While the Reggio Emilia approach is specific to the region in Italy, we understand that our approach is uniquely based upon the values, needs, and resources of our Burlington community, and the Jewish teachings interwoven throughout our daily learning experiences.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool";;"Yes";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";;;"Full-Time, Part-Time";"English";;"08:00:00 to 17:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;"Allergy Awareness";"3 Star";;281713

Instead of    discipline, we use guidance. Guidance is about building an encouraging    setting for every person in the group. It means helping young children    understand they can learn from their mistakes, and it starts with    showing them how (NAEYC). Socially-emotionally healthy children are    better able to establish and maintain positive relationships with    adults and peers. To support our students in developing these skills,    we take a proactive and preventive approach to guidance that    reinforces appropriate behaviors rather than focusing on inappropriate    behaviors. Our Environment: We provide children with exciting    materials and engage them in activities that are appropriate for their    age to keep them focused and attentive. We develop schedules that meet    the needs of young children by avoiding long periods of wait time    without activity. Yet, our schedule is flexible enough to follow the    childrens interests as well as their cognitive, physical, and    biological needs. Our Teachers: We work to develop a strong rapport    with each child speaking to children calmly, especially during    redirections. We help children put words to their emotions. We use    social stories to help teach our students healthy social skills. We    strive to serve the individual needs of each child while ensuring the    safety of young children.

Our program philosophy is that each child enters our classroom with unique needs and abilities because each of them has their own experiences and backgrounds. The preschool aged child is naturally explorative and eager to learn. It is the role of the teachers to provide opportunities for growth and stimulation in all areas of development. The preschool curriculum is a combination of play-based and education-based learning. Through play and interaction with materials and peers children learn important social and emotional skills that prepare them for future learning. Play is both meaningful and necessary. It is the role of teachers and staff to serve as models, initiators and observers of learning. Teaching staff needs to be aware and sensitive to the daily emotional and intellectual needs of each child and create and environment where children feel safe and comfortable, allowing them to experiment, explore, and develop the types of learning styles that work best for them. Ultimately, the success of each child will build a positive sense of self and a confidence that will serve as the child's foundation for future learning and growth.";"Preschool";"Pre-K Program";"No";"No";"Yes";"No";"Smoke Free";"Workplace-Based";;"Daytime, Part-Time";"English";"School Year Only";"08:15:00 to 15:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;"Clarendon Elementary School";"Allergy Awareness, Special Diets";"4 Star";;4214

Our discipline goals include    helping children establish internal controls. The ultimate goal is    self-discipline. Helping children recognize, name and verbalize their    feelings and needs rather than withdrawing or acting them out    physically, helping to foster a comfortable and safe environment.";"Children are learning all the time, not only when they are engaged in planned activities. While activities provide learning opportunities, they are not more valuable than routines and interactions. With this understanding, we offer unstructured, enjoyable experiences that foster natural development. Activities are mostly open-ended and emphasize process over product. Children are free to choose which activities they want to participate in and are offered encouragement to try new experiences. Children are engaged in discovery of the properties of materials and items in their environment. They need repeated experiences before they are able to use materials symbolically. At Little Feats, children have many opportunities to pursue in-depth investigations of materials. Only with this kind of knowledge can they begin to use the materials to represent their world and express themselves symbolically. The teachers are aware of each child throughout the day and how the child's day flows.

Through a    combination of redirection, natural consequences, and adverting    behaviors before they start, positive behavior management can be    achieved. Behavior Wellness Policy: Children whom have exhibited    inappropriate or harmful behaviors are in need of support from staff    and parents. It is with this in mind that we have developed this    policy to provide a safe environment for all children. Behavioral    concerns include: biting, excessive aggressive physical acts,    inappropriate language, and any acts deemed by teachers and directors    to be having a negative impact in the well being of staff and children    in care. There are several steps taken when a child displays a    behavioral concern. We provide accident reports, I hurt my friend    reports, to provide insight as to why this may be occurring. Below are    the action steps we take in these matters: Comfort the victim first to    model compassion and empathy. Discussion with or removal from the    situation with the child that is the aggressor from the immediate    area. Redirection to a new activity, one that helps release aggressive    feelings. Substitutions of other activities to help lessen aggressive    acts such as: teething toys, play dough for pounding, sensory    activities, or a safe space with pillows. Follow up with praise for    the change in behavior when appropriate behavior is being displayed.    Articulating exactly what changes we see. Always encourage the child    to use words, on a developmentally appropriate level, and assist them    with the use and implementation. Shadowing a child, documenting    triggers and evaluating situations to stop behavior before it happens.    Outside referrals from such agencies such as Child Care Resource and    the Howard Center. We maintain documentation of all behavioral issues    in each child's file. Clear communication between teachers and parents    is vital in helping a child with such behaviors. Conferences will be    necessary so we can work together to form a plan for the child.";"Mission Statement: At Freedom Rains, our mission is to provide: A responsive, developmentally appropriate full-day curriculum program for ages six weeks to five years and up. An environment where children and families feel safe, secure and connected to each other and the program. Promote individual learning styles, and the uniqueness of each child. We want to support each child to become the best they can be, in an environment where it is okay to make mistakes, and grow and learn at one's own pace. Philosophy: The center provides a developmentally appropriate play-based curriculum that is designed specifically for each age group it serves. Our goal is to develop caring, respectful and responsive relationships with children. and families by partnering with families to support a child's growth and development. We believe it takes a community to raise a caring, engaged and happy child. Our goal is to maintain a constant, respectful and reciprocal form of communication within the child's school and family unit. Our staff supports each child's disposition to learn while: Facilitating their learning and fostering learning in all domains including intellectual, physical, social and emotional. We respect and support that each child has an individualized pattern and timing of growth, as well as personality and learning style, interest, culture, and family background that are central to the daily interactions and the direction that our curriculum follows. We value the interaction between the child and the environment, seeing it as the basis for complex learning and growth. Children learn through play, and hands on learning that is meaningful to them and their skill level. Our program curriculum has a strong emphasis on hands on learning that incorporates play and sensory on every level. The schedule and space is structured to allow children to pace themselves and select activities based upon their individual needs.

Learning appropriate    ways of handling conflict is a part of that task. At times, all    children may resort to less than ideal solutions. Of particular    importance is the acknowledgment of children's rights to their own    feelings. We can teach children knowledge and skills and it is    extremely important to encourage and nurture feelings and dispositions    as well (Katz, 1990). In order to do this we need to accept and    acknowledge less positive emotions to allow the child to experience    and explore his/her sense of self. At the same time, it is not    appropriate to act out those feelings in a way that would harm    oneself, others or property. This includes verbal, as well as physical    actions. All of the children are encouraged to talk things out with    other children when settling a dispute. Adults will tell children to    ""use words,"" ""tell them that you don't like that,"" etc. Children gain    a sense of autonomy and pride when they are able to handle a problem    successfully with no adult intervention. When safety becomes an issue    educators will intervene. We do not encourage children to say, Im    sorry, as a method of conflict resolution. Many children do not fully    understand the feeling of sorry until later in life. The sentiment is    lost upon young children as it becomes a habitual response as opposed    to a meaningful solution. Instead we guide children to check-in with a    classmate after someone has been hurt. This can mean offering comfort,    space, or talking through the conflict to resolve the issue. As a    general rule we:  Prompt children to ask if they can help the hurt    child.  Do not force the child who was hurt to talk to the other    child right away. If the injured child is not ready to talk, then the    child would check back in again later.  Role model scenarios for    non-verbal children. Biting is a situation that is challenging and    difficult for all involved. This behavior is most common in    toddler-aged children and it can be considered a stage of normal    development for some children as toddlers are developmentally    egocentric. This means they do not understand that other people do not    think and feel the same thing they are thinking and feeling. The    educators of the center are responsible for setting clear guidelines.    Physical discipline is never used. Food and other physical necessities    are never withheld. Corporal punishment is never allowed at the ELC.    It is illegal in the state of Vermont to use corporal punishment on a    child in an educational and care setting. This is true for all people    on the Early Learning Center premises including families.";"History-New Beginning In May 2020 a group of parents and educators (including ELC staff) came together to form an independent non-profit organization to continue strong and supportive child care in the community. The doors of this new Early Learning Center opened on August 31, 2020. The current capacity is 38 children with 9 full-time educators. The ELC originally opened as the Early Learning Center at Saint Michaels College on August 27, 1982, licensed for 15 children in the basement of Hamel Hall on the St. Michael's College campus. The initial group structure was two infants with one teacher, who was also the Centers director, 6 toddlers with two teachers and 7 preschoolers with one teacher. The Center grew over the years reaching a capacity of 42 children and 9 full-time staff members. In February, 2009 the center was moved to a new location, above ground. This current facility includes much more natural light and opportunity to observe the outdoors, easier egress, wheelchair accessibility, separate classrooms, and more. In May 2020, the decision was made by Saint Michael's College to close the Center. The Early Learning Center maintains close ties to the Saint Michaels College community. Philosophy Our center is committed to providing the very best early childhood education experience for every child and family in our care. We believe that each and every child is a unique individual who thrives in an environment where they feel safe and valued. Our center provides a secure base, which nurtures a sense of belonging for every child in our care. We believe that children are competent learners from birth. We value childrens natural curiosity and individual ideas and we facilitate childrens learning through a developmentally appropriate, play-based curriculum. 5 We believe in equity and inclusion. Our center values diversity and celebrates individual differences, and we strive to create an environment that promotes tolerance and creates respectful relationships. We believe in positive partnerships. We understand that parents are the first and most enduring educators of their children and we value the opportunity for meaningful collaboration. Our center welcomes the contribution and active participation of parents and families in our community. We believe in the life-long value of high-quality early education. We understand that a strong foundation in the early years supports the development of resilience and enables every individual to achieve their fullest potential in life. Vision Our vision is to cultivate and create an early childhood community of connection and belonging. We strive to contribute to the development of a stronger, more equitable community in Vermont by creating an early foundation based on respect and kindness. Mission To value children and families and promote positive learning experiences in an environment that inspires curiosity, nurtures respectful relationships and empowers active involvement in the community. Values Values based on the Core Concepts of:  Respect (for self and others, fostering an understanding of individual differences and diversity)  Sharing (promoting equity and openness, a sense of belonging and responsibility)  Health and Wellbeing (promoting physical, emotional and mental health)  High Quality Early Education (based on Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), through a play-based curriculum, which is planned and implemented by professional early educators)  Partnership (with parents/guardians, colleagues, community";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool";"Pre-K Program";"No";"Yes";"Yes";"Yes";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";;"Full-Time, Part-Time";"English";;"07:30:00 to 17:15:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;"Allergy Awareness";"4 Star";;434920

Gentle guidance, soothing compassion, peaceful    persuasions, repeated reminders, brief explanations, and many    diversions! This epitomizes the discipline techniques used with our    youngest students. Since these young children are just beginning the    arduous task of acquiring appropriate social skills (the majority of    which are learned by the age of six), all guidance needs to be    nurturing, extremely compassionate, incredibly simple, and always    informative - while simultaneously teaching the children to empathize    with others (which is done by focusing, acknowledging and labeling    one's feelings) and to be respectful of individual differences. We    also use a more preventive discipline with our preschoolers, providing    much positive reinforcement, engaging the children in a curriculum    that is fun and interesting, carefully supervising all classroom and    playground activities, and providing an atmosphere that is cheerful,    caring and considerate. We also teach tolerance of each individual's    differences, within the realms of safety and respect, of course. These    techniques effectively teach the children right from wrong, while    simultaneously developing a healthy self-esteem. The teacher must be    consistent, be sure the child knows why his/her actions were    inappropriate, NEVER physically reprimand or berate the child, and    ALWAYS use quiet discipline, never yelling or causing embarrassment.    Since time-out tends to embarrass a child and does not allow a child    to learn appropriate, alternative behaviors, it is only used in    persistent or extreme situations, such as when a child's well-being is    at risk. As an alternative to time-outs, we have also used    self-controlled breaks. This is where a child is removed from a    situation until he/she calms down. In this instance, the child decides    when he/she is ready to return to the activity; thus allowing the    child to take responsibility for his/her own actions. Frequent    communication between home and school also helps to ensure consistency    when disciplinary actions become necessary. This is accomplished    verbally at pick up time or with a written note in your mailbox.    Conversely, we ask that parents let us know immediately of any and all    concerns they may have at any time. Ideally, this open communication    prevents situations from escalating to a point where significant    disciplinary actions are even needed. When ordinary methods of    discipline are ineffective, a meeting is arranged with the parents to    help develop a specific plan of action relevant to the situation.    Since children learn respect, caring, & many developmental skills by    watching adults cope with discipline problems, this is a    responsibility we take very seriously.";"We have been offering an appropriate educationally based program since 1982, taking the WHOLE child into account: socially, emotionally, physically, mentally, etc. We're not ""just a daycare.""

The program is play-based and addresses the curriculum domains in the Vermont Early Learning Standards. Shortly before pick-up, there are Spanish mini-lessons for parents. I hold a current VT Early Childhood Educator's license along with an endorsement in art and a lapsed one in Spanish k-12.";"Preschool";"Food Program, Pre-K Program";"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Smoke Free";"House";"Dog, Cat";"Daytime, Part-Time";"English, French, Spanish";"School Year Only";"08:30:00 to 13:30:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday";;;"Allergy Awareness, Special Diets";"4 Star";;147251

We do    this by implementing clear, ageappropriate routines and expectations    that stimulate growth and development in self-control, selfregulation,    positive self-esteem, and cooperation. When challenging, disruptive    behaviors or conflicts occur, we use this opportunity to first model    effective age-appropriate communication and self-help skills.    Educators respond calmly and respectfully and continue to provide for    the safety of all classroom children. Behavior management is positive,    supportive and non-physical. This may include being one on one with a    child or moving to a safe space for de-escalation or re-direction.    When a challenging behavior/challenge occur on an ongoing basis,    educators also use environmental modification and other teaching    strategies to prevent and respond to these behaviors. We use    strategies aligned with The Early Multi-Tiered Systems of Supports    https://buildingbrightfutures.org/whatis-early-mtss/ and the Early    Learning Second Steps programs    https://www.secondstep.org/what-issecond-step when working with our    children and identifying challenges within the classroom.Family    communication will occur so that a common plan can be created as a    team to help support the child and classroom. This may take place in    frequent communications or scheduled meetings between the educators    and family member(s). If professional referrals are needed, a written    parental permission is required in advance. Educators frequently work    with outside agencies and resources, including the Child Care Resource    & Referral Center (CCR), the Child Integrated Services - Early    Intervention (CIS-EI), the Howard Center and the EEE program at the    local public schools and the State Licensing Agency. In the event of    needing ongoing behavioral or developmental support, the support team    (the educator, director, family, and referral agency) may suggest one    of the following measures: that your childs schedule is adjusted for    the protection of your child and others or that an Individual    Assistant is needed. If an Instructional Assistant is needed, it is    the responsibility of the family (or outside agencies) to the funding    and hiring. Both short- and long-term plans will be created to monitor    success or lack thereof, which may include ending care at the center.    Large group care isnt always a good fit for every child. We work with    families to assess and determine if our center can meet the needs of    the child. The Director reserves the right to deny your childcare    after supports in place are not successful or in extreme cases of    unsafe behavior.";"We practice a child-centered approach that responds to the changing interests of each child. Our educators modify curriculum and explore current developments in educational theory to ensure quality childcare. We provide the children with additional instruction from certified swim, tennis and other fitness professionals employed by The Edge as well as outside music and activity professionals.  Each location has been awarded 4 STARS in the STep Ahead Recognition System (STARS) awarded by the Vermont Dept. of Children and Families. Programs that participate in STARS are stepping ahead  going above and beyond state regulations to provide professional services that meet the needs of children and families.  Each location participates in the Early Learning Partnership Program through approved area school districts and in line with ACT 166 Pre-Kindergarten, meaning our curriculum is consistent with the VT Early Learning Standards, and we use Teaching Strategies Gold to assess childrens development.  We integrate music and movement, cardiovascular exercise (running and aerobic) and introductory organized sports into our daily routine.  Flexible schedules we offer a partial or a full week program. Partial week is MWF or Tue/Thu. Full week is M-F. The program hours of operation are 8:00am-5:00pm.  Our facilities include several indoor and outdoor play areas that provide opportunities to explore and develop a sense of community Our Vision To provide a warm and nurturing environment that allows us to develop a trusting and respectful relationship with your family, to foster the social, emotional, physical, and intellectual growth of each child, and to promote wellness and healthy living. Our Mission By creating close and responsive relationships with every family and child, together, we will be able to offer each child an enriching experience that will challenge and engage their own specific interests and development.

Our curriculum reflects our commitment to what we believe is the best practice in Early Childhood Education. Our goal is to create an environment that is rich in language and learning opportunities. It is a blend of teacher directed and individual learning experiences where each child is challenged at a level they can meet. This provides for successful learning experiences and stimulates a positive attitude towards education. Each classroom is divided into interest areas designed to create interactions that support emotional, social, intellectual, and physical development on a daily basis. Our educators facilitate, observe, and encourage your child to explore their environment. A typical daily schedule is filled with opportunities that balance quiet/active, large group/small group, indoor/outdoor time and teacher directed/child chosen activities.

At no time    will a child be physically or verbally abused in any way. In striving    to foster the partnership between provider and family, you will be    informed of any behavioral issues. We will work as a team to provide    the emotional support needed to assist the child with modifying the    behavior at home and in care. There is no one right way to discipline.    An approach that is successful in one situation may not work in    another. Also, different children respond in different ways to    disciplining methods. Successful caregivers use a variety of    approaches to deal with behavioral problems. Discipline shall be    through redirection, praise, active listening, natural and logical    consequences when safe, distraction, problem solving, and timeout. A    ""time out"" is just that-a cooling off period. When a child is    misbehaving or out of control, the child needs to be removed and    redirected for a few minutes. For young children the practice is 1    minute for each year of age; i.e. 5 years old=5 minute cool down. A    time out gives a child a few minutes to settle down and think about    what has happened. Caregivers will follow up by talking with the child    about the behavior. Young children often don't understand their    misdoings. I will explain what happened, what they should not be    doing, and what they can do instead.";"The daily schedule may look like this depending on the seasons and ages of children in attendance: 6:00-7:30AM: Parents/Guardians & children begin to arrive, free-play is during this time after hands are washed and stuff hung up 7:15-7:45AM: Morning work/coloring activity 7:45-8:00AM: Cleanup/bathroom/hand washing 8:00-9:00AM: Breakfast (per Vermont Food Program Regulations) 9:00-9:15AM: Cleanup/bathroom/hand washing 9:15-9:45AM: Circle time, Good morning songs & exercises (weather permitting outside) 9:45-10:00AM: Cleanup/bathroom/hand washing 10:00-10:15AM: Snack (per Vermont Food Program Regulations) 10:15-10:20AM: Clean up/bathroom/hand washing 10:20-11:30AM: Free Play (weather permitting outside) with Curriculum/Arts/Music 11:30-11:40AM: Clean up/bathroom/ hand washing/ set up mats 11:30-12:30PM: Lunch (per Vermont Food Program Regulations) 12:30-12:45PM: Cleanup/bathroom/hand washing 12:45-3:00PM: Nap/quiet time (After a period of 30 minutes of resting, quiet activities will be provided to those children who aren't asleep) 3:00-3:30PM Snack (per Vermont Food Program Regulations) 3:45-3:55PM: Cleanup/bathroom/hand washing 3:55-4:30PM: Free play (weather permitting outside) and/or chidlren's choice activities 4:30-7:00PM: Cleanup/bathroom/hand washing/dinner/free play/pick up";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";"Food Program, Pre-K Program";"Yes";"Yes";"Yes";"Yes";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"House";"Dog, Cat, Other Non-Furry Animal";"After School, Before School, Before and After School, Daytime, Drop-in Care, Emergency Care, Full-Time, Part-Time";"English";;"06:30:00 to 17:30:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";"School Bus Route, From Home, To Home, From School, To School";"Fair Haven Grade School, Fair Haven UHSD #16";;"4 Star";;197365

Learning how to identify    feelings openly and use social emotional language around moments of    conflict are the core elementsof early childhood experiences in the    class, on the playground or any time! Guidance is provided by    teacher's modeling empathy, understanding and support and responding    in ways that acknowledge feelings and provide safety for all children.    When conflicts occur between children the teacher's job is to help    children use language (or model the language) to identify the problem    and the respective feelings each child is having. Without solving the    problem for the child, the teacher scaffolds the children's problem    solving skills. These may require to take some space, help get a cold    pack, check in to see if they are OK, or try out a new solution that    the children think is a good one. Then after a short time, ask the    children if that solution worked. Dan Gartrell outlines this in a 5    step process: Identify the problem, acknowledge the feeligs, problem    solve a solution, try it out, check back in. Useful to use 5 fingers    on the hand for a visual for kids too! Children have quiet spaces in    the classroom and out in the woods or the playground at all times so    they can use them freely. This, along with many sensory activities    during the day, can serve as preventative intervention to challenging    behavior.";"We are a 5 STAR nature-based program and believe in play-based, hands-on outdoor experiences that are appropriate to each child's developmental level. We value each family as a child's first teacher, and are committed to building a community where families feel connected to one another, and the greater Hinesburg community. As one of the first Eco-healthy child care certified programs in Vermont, we are also committed to making sustainable environmental choices and business practices both inside and outside the classroom to support the health and wellness of all who work and play here. Every classroom has a fish tank or an animal to observe, feed and care for (guinea pigs, rabbits, and chickens!) Our head teachers all have degrees in early childhood, and continually participate in professional development coursework that benefits our classrooms in unique ways (e.g. committees to design our new outdoor playscapes). We are a dedicated community that values deep relationships with children, families and staff and we hope that you share our vision! Each classroom (age 2-8) takes care of our chicken flock on different days of the week, and families help out on weekends, too. We have over 3 acres of green space, including an onsite ""little woods"" wildflower meadow, berm, garden beds tended by children and onsite in-ground pool for everyone's enjoyment in the summer months. We take care of worm farms, and use them (along with our chicken flock and ""green cone"" composters to compost food waste for a zero food waste footprint!

Methods include reinforcement such as verbal    praise, smiles, and pleasant attention. Kid Savvy provides a safe,    home-like environment. We foster creativity, encourage children to    explore and allow them to make discoveries. When inappropriate    behavior occurs, it is dealt with immediately. We will respond to the    behavior as well as the situation, try to identify the cause, and    recognize if this particular behavior is a repeated pattern that is a    call for help to resolve this kind of situation. There will be limits    and boundaries, rules and routines, and encouragement of    self-discipline because order and stability are important to a young    child. Enforcing boundaries and rules using the following techniques:    Ignoring: Some negative behavior is produced by a child to get    attention. It can be stopped when it does not get the attention    desired. I will use this technique unless a safety issue is involved.    Redirection: I offer alternatives to children engaged in undesirable    behavior by presenting a different toy or activity. Verbal    Intervention: I explain to the child the inappropriate behavior and    show him/her the appropriate way to handle the situation with words.    Logical Consequences: I help the child understand the logical    consequence of his/her actions by removing the object or activity in    which the child is engaged. Take a Break: After all above techniques    are used, the child is separated from the group to allow them to think    about their choices, relax and calm down so that I may speak one on    one with them. While on a break, the child will have limited access to    activities and will be closely monitored. They may return to the group    when they are calm, showing more focus and the behavior has stopped.    If the child is taking recurring breaks, or this system is not    working, a conference will be held to make a plan for the child.

We want students to develop their own inner control by understanding    limits and the results of their actions. When challenging behaviors    present themselves, we try to separate the deed from the doer so    that no child is made to feel ashamed or embarrassed. We emphasize and    acknowledge the positive behaviors, social skills, and work habits of    all our students. Students are encouraged to discuss problems and    resolve conflicts using their words. Working cooperatively with    others is a skill that must be experimented with and learned. Adults    intervene in problem solving only to help provide words or guidance    for children working through a difficult situation. Mutual respect,    understanding, and consistency are the foundation to the approach    implemented by the staff. At times where verbal reminders are not    effective and a student is losing self-control, he/she may be asked to    sit down quietly until ready to try again. At this point the situation    at hand is discussed with the child and problem solving begins. The    teachers will always be positive, supportive, and consistent in    helping children deal with conflicts and feelings. Self-discipline is    the goal with children. Students are never bad; however, the    behavior may be unsafe or unexpected. Limit setting will be clear and    consistent with natural and logical sequences.";"Mission Statement We offer experiences and provide opportunities for students to engage in their own curiosities by creating a safe and enriched environment where students are listened to, guided, and allowed to experience independence while learning about themselves, others in their environment, and in other cultures, and the world. Through these experiences we instill a rich and engaging academic background for future success and happiness. Vision Statement We will provide opportunities for students to discover the joy of life-long learning and working with families to create a strong foundation for future success. Our Process We provide the steppingstones to success using the Montessori Philosophy and a rich Nature Based Curriculum. In using the two approaches we are introducing students to the aspects of their own innate curiosity of experiences for both the indoor and outdoor environments while providing a safe space where all children are free to express and be themselves. The Children's Institute at Jericho believes qualified and highly educated teachers focusing on the growth and development of the whole child is the only way to achieve our mission.

Our expectation is that children and    adults practice and promote respect for themselves and each other. As    well, MASK follows the expectations of the school day and are based on    the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and Social,    Emotional, and Ethical (SEE) frameworks by teaching children what it    looks and sounds like to meet these behavioral expectations at    different settings within our usable space and the school building. We    expect the child to contribute to a safe, positive, and engaging    learning atmosphere by being respectful to themselves and others. This    includes being kind, safe, and ready to learn. The goal of this policy    is to ensure an environment where the expectations for behavior are    clearly stated, understood, and followed by both children and staff.    We are committed to creating a consistency of policies that are in    alignment with the school day policies of Milton Elementary School.    This includes the behavior and expectation policies. We practice    positive discipline methods and have no tolerance for any level of    physical, emotional, or verbal abuse. Discipline should be used and    regarded as a positive way to improve a childs challenging behavior    and to teach them respect and responsibility. We believe that children    learn behaviors through adult and peer interactions (modeling). We    also believe that consistent and predictable expectations and    consequences, as well as follow through and follow up with the child,    are key to a childs successful behavior. Likewise, consequences need    to be natural and logical and designed to teach the child appropriate    behavior. We attempt to teach acceptable behavior through modeling,    consistent and predictable expectations and consequences, positive    feedback and encouragement, natural consequences, redirection, and    alternate choices. This is a brief overview of our guidance policy. A    more detailed policy is provided in our family handbook to interested    families.";"The MASK program provides a safe, engaging, and nurturing environment for families requiring quality child care for before and after school, holidays, and summer vacation. MASK offers educational, fun, and enriching activities for students ages 5-12. Students will learn to take responsibility for their own actions, develop appropriate social behaviors through positive role modeling by the staff and other students, and be encouraged to build healthy habits through the use of healthy snacks and physically active time. MASKs dedicated staff recognizes the essential role of out-of-school care for working families in Milton and the surrounding communities and strives to continue to provide quality care. MASK staff will provide homework assistance, educational activities, and opportunities for further exploration of student interests inside and outside of the classroom. MASK strives to meet each childs need for physical and intellectual activities through a carefully designed schedule of educational, enrichment, and recreational programs. Throughout the year, the children are offered a variety of activities or clubs at no additional cost to parents. Activities can be one-time opportunities or may be scheduled on a weekly basis for a specific period of time. Activities will be introduced to the children during a regular MASK circle time and posted on MASK Facebook as well as the bulletin board by the MASK staff cart. All special activities are voluntary so if a child does not wish to participate in an activity, they may follow the regular MASK schedule.

When the child is old enough to    understand the rules, and disobeys them with inappropriate behavior    (i.e. hitting, biting, aggression) the following developmentally    appropriate guidance is used: 1. Positive reinforcement: The child is    encouraged and praised when showing acceptable behavior choices. 2.    Redirection: The child will be redirected to another activity and    given another chance to try another time. 3. Calm down time: This is a    used as a last resort when the child repeatedly is disruptive, refuses    to follow directions; is exhibiting temper tantrum-type behavior or is    hurting oneself, others or equipment.

You may be called    to remove your child from the center if his/her behavior prevents the    center staff from being able to properly care for the other children.

Our goals are: To provide a safe, warm, nurturing, stimulating, and comfortable environment where children can explore their surroundings, and create an understanding of the world around them. To respect each child as an individual with unique abilities, feelings, needs and wants. To develop positive self-concepts by creating an atmosphere geared to successful experiences. To promote character development by teaching and demonstrating the values of caring, honest, respect and responsibility. To give each child a stimulating and creative child care experience that provides him/her with the desire to learn, now and in the future. We strive to create meaningful and trusting relationships between the children, families, staff and community. We believe that children learn best through play and active involvement with people and materials in their environment. Creative Hands Learning Center utilizes Creative Curriculum. Creative Curriculum balances both teacher directed and child initiated learning, with an emphasis on responding to children's learning styles and building their strengths and interests. Creative Curriculum is a scientifically based early childhood curriculum that has been shown to improve cognitive and social/emotional outcomes in young children. Your child will participate in a well planned program, each day the teacher designs developmentally appropriate learning experiences to meet the children's needs for their age group. Our children are engaged in learning through literacy, blocks, dramatic play, toys and games, art, library, discovery, sand and water, music and movement, cooking, computers, outdoor play. Our curriculum shows teachers how to offer children opportunities to make choices, value children's ideas, help children express their feelings in constructive ways, provide appropriate play materials that support and challenge children's abilities., permit children freedom to get messy during play, promote problem solving and appropriate risk setting, provide children with ample time for creative expression, allow children freedom to explore their environment, encourage children to work independently, encourage children to see tasks through to completion, provide appropriate real-work responsibilities and jobs.

Every effort    will be made to give the words and adult assistance that they may need    to work through a conflict. Redirecting helps children gain    self-control in a positive manner. Cool down times may be given as    well. When a child cannot use appropriate behavior to work through a    conflict, they may be removed from play until I feel secure in their    abilities. After resolving the conflict, the child will be encouraged    to rejoin when they are ready to do so. Natural consequences are    sometimes the best way to help young children learn independence and    self-help skills. Incidents that lead to the harm of others will be    documented and signed by parents. Follow-up plans will be assessed for    the best solution for behavior guidance. Parents have the right to    discipline their children in their own way. Parents may not speak to    their child in a demeaning or negative way or use any type of corporal    punishment while in my home. Parents should talk with me if you see    another child acting out. When another child is hurt, that child will    be comforted and cared for prior to conflict resolution. When they    can, both will help in the process. Words like, what can I do to make    you feel better? will be used. In the event that a disruptive    behavior is on going, outside resources may be utilized including but    not limited to online resources, Child Care Resource, the Howard    Center, the Family Infant Toddler Program, or the EEE program in    Milton.";"A tidbit about me: Welcome to my home and thank you for your interest in me caring for your little one. After my son was born in 2003, my world revolved around his coo's and cry's. After spending the first year with my son, I discovered the world of Childcare. I had worked in a childcare center since 2004, with most of that time dedicated to working at Little Feats Too right here in Milton. I was the preschool teacher there for almost 9 wonderful years. As I grew professionally, it became clear to me that I wanted to watch children in my home so in 2015 I began my play-based home childcare. My family consists of my husband, Ladd, my son, Alex, and our pets, Abby the cat, Delilah the Miniature Schnauzer, and Zeuss, the Daschund. The dogs will bark when you first meet them, but other than some jumping, are very well mannered once they have settled. In my home, I will be helping your child to learn to care and love animals. I'm happy to share the love of my pets with all families who choose to become our extended family. I hold a valid CDA credential as well as CPR and First Aid training. As a teacher I will go to trainings that will pertain to child development and the fields of professionalism each year that will total at least 12 hours if not more. I am a registered home provider and offer breakfast, lunch and snack. Curriculum and Learning Opportunities: I will provide a schedule that meets the needs of each individual. Adequate times will be scheduled through out your child's day for play, one-on one interaction, large group and small group opportunities, eating, sleeping, and physical activities. A typical day will include opportunities for your child to build on their social, emotional, creative, problem-solving and physical development. My goals for children are to become confident about who they are. I will focus on their interests and build a curriculum to meet those passions. Some of my favorite things in life is the nature around us. I am passionate about outside opportunities and learning about creepy crawlies. Each child will be given the opportunity through out the day to participate in games, outside play, music and dance, story times (I LOVE BOOKS!), writing skills and art activities as well as sensory choices, cooking, cleaning, simple jobs and caring for animals. I will model positive social skills and actions and give them the redirection and support that they need. Infants will follow their own individual routine and be given opportunities that are new and unique, with plenty of tummy time, practice in standing and sitting, sensory experiences, book reading and outside exploration plus more!";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";;"No";"No";;"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"House";"Dog, Cat";"After School, Before School, Full-Time, Part-Time";"English";;"07:30:00 to 17:30:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";"School Bus Route, City Bus Route";"Milton Elementary School";"Allergy Awareness";"2 Star";;23927

Some of our most important    guidance principles are, role model, allow for individualism,    establish rules and establish an atmosphere of mutual respect between    ourselves and the children enrolled at Miss Robin's Nest. Use positive    verbal and non-verbal responses to children and foster creativity in    everything we do. We talk all the time and we encourage problem    solving. We foster self esteem each and every day and take time to    really listen to each child's feelings, likes and dislikes. Our    preschool children know that our younger group is ""little and    learning"" so modeling is important and recognized as an important job    on a daily basis. Nurture, love and respect each child as an    individual. We talk to each child and work things out together. We do    have a thinking step where a child can choose to sit, regroup and then    rejoins activities when he/she feels ready. Our main school rules are:    we cannot hurt ourselves, we cannot hurt others, we all must use    walking feet, we must treat others with respect, and we must never    destroy things. Our favorite group saying is ""If you don't have    anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"".";"Our philosophy is to help children develop intellectually, physically, emotionally and artistically so that they acquire a life long love of learning. Children learn in so many ways and develop at different rates of speed. Children of the same age may not necessarily be at the same developmental level. My goal is to individualize learning plans for each of my children enrolled. Make observations and track developmental achievements and delays if any. Screening young children is an effective way to gauge developmental progress and to determine meaningful next steps. Developmental delays, learning disorders, behavioral and social problems are estimated to affect 1 in 6 children. Early intervention is KEY. Being aware of the importance of the Arts to the developing human brain gives us even more reasons to be sure to provide young children every opportunity to explore their creativity in the early childhood art program. Painting, drawing, etc., can help and improve their attention and cognition. ""Are is not the same for a child as it is for an adult. For a child, art is primarily a means of expression. No two children are a like and in fact, each child differs even from his earlier self as he constantly grows, perceives his environment. A child is a dynamic being; are becomes for him a language of thought"". (Mayesky p 9, 1987) A daily routine is in place so that all children to to know what cones next. Lesson plans connect with VELS and COmmon Core, which our school system follows in Montpelier. WE plan lessons for the preschool age children and adaprt the lesson plan for the younger group. Depending on what type of disability, we would make any changes needed to better integrate the child into our classroom.. WE call on the EEE program if we need any specialists.

Inspired by the idea that all children encompass multiple    intelligences, and everyone has strengths to share, we manage    behaviors from a positive perspective. We view the environment and    curriculum as an additional teacher. A carefully planned space and    activities lead behaviors naturally in a positive direction, where    children are allowed to shine and show their best selves. Further, we    recognize that negative or disruptive behaviors are an expression of    needs and wants and we can help children to meet such needs in a safe    and appropriate manner. When difficult situations arise with older    children, adults observe to see if children are able to handle the    situation themselves and follow up by making observations about what    went well. Solutions may include redirection, engaging children in    creating solutions, and encouraging them to take ownership over their    own behavior and the effect it has in their learning environments. We    utilize a system for conflict resolution that we call ""fire breaks.""    It is a tiered process that allows children to step away from the    group, center themselves, and then to share with an adult and other    children involved how they perceived the situation. We also ask them    to check in with others and ask how they are feeling. Together, they    will then work on solutions. Adults are present to help as needed, but    children lead so that the solution is authentic, positive, and easily    implemented. Once resolution has happened, children rejoin the group.    At all times, safety and respect are non-negotiables, and we work to    help children understand what that means, and what it looks like. We    expect that they may forget, have questions, need guidance, and make    mistakes. Through these processes we are able to help children bloom    into compassionate, respectful, resourceful and responsible young    people.";"At Neck of the Woods, we firmly believe in a strengths-based approach to education and learning, to social and emotional growth for children as well as their families and communities.

This is achieved    in an environment of respect for all children. In this environment,    the child will respect the rights of others and develop control from    within. Clear limits and classroom rules set at the beginning of the    year must be reinforced consistently. Children will model their    behavior after yours. The first step to having a class with    self-discipline is for you (their role model) to be self-disciplined    and controlled. You must always respond (not react) to each situation.    When you feel yourself reacting or becoming angry, you must either    gain control immediately or remove yourself from the situation and ask    your coworker to take over. Children's conduct does not change    overnight, and we, therefore, cannot expect an immediate change from    any behavior. We never expect children to jump at any command given by    a teacher. Or long-range goal is to develop self-discipline rather    than obedience. On no occasion will a teacher use insulting,    humiliating, frightening, or intimidating language/behavior when    dealing with a child. School may be the first place some children    experience as being sufficiently safe to really be themselves and    express their feelings. Staff members, who use insulting, humiliating    or frightening means to respond to children, will be investigated and    if behavior rises to the level of abuse or neglect as defined by the    State, the incidents(s) will be reported to the Department of Children    and Families (DCF). If the State of Vermont and/or DCF ""substantiate""    abuse or neglect, the staff person will be terminated immediately. If    The State of Vermont and/or DCF determine that abuse or neglect is    ""unsubstantiated"", the incident may nevertheless reflect poor    judgement, inappropriate conduct or a departure from school philosophy    or culture on the part of the staff person that may result in    discipline up to and including termination of employment. Physical    discipline of a child because the staff person has lost his/her temper    or self-control can not be tolerated. All such incidents will be    reported to The State of Vermont and/or DCF and the staff member will    be terminated immediately. Discipline methods will be reviewed on a    continual basis during staff meetings throughout the year. If you have    any unusual discipline issues, you should discuss them with the    Director.";"Timson Hill Preschool, also known as the Williamsville Children's Center, is located in the village of Williamsville in a historic old school house. Our facility is fully licensed by the state of Vermont, and currently accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. THP staff provides a warm, nurturing, secure environment. A developmental approach is used to design age-appropriate activities that nurture the the child's sense of adventure, self-confidence, humor, and discovery, as well as allowing for opportunities to observe, investigate, and explore. Multi-age groups of children learn to master social skills and develop self-esteem during process- oriented activities. The non-competitive and creative atmosphere fosters a child's respect for others, regardless of different religious and/or ethnic backgrounds. Within our goal of overall positive development, children increase their social, emotional, intellectual and physical skills at their own pace. Our staff is a group of early childhood professionals who continuously collaborate to provide the children with a program of the highest quality. They view each child within the context of his/her individual family, and work with parents to support that family's choices and concerns in ways that best serve the child. The curriculum is developed through teacher observation of the children and is based on a solid understanding of child development. Each day is planned around the children's full range of needs: social, emotional, physical, and cognitive. Time is available for daily conversations about the child's day and any questions parents might have. More involved discussions about the child's development and how s/he participates in the group happen twice a year during parent/teacher conferences. Timson Hill Preschool is a non-profit cooperative. The school strives to keep tuition costs as low as possible, and all THP families are therefore expected to participate in fundraising, organizational, and contractual obligations which help keep our school viable. Children must be at least three years old before attending school, unless pre-arrangements are made with the Director. Children turning three later in the school year may be accepted after their third birthday as openings occur, and a deposit to hold the spot may be requested in this case. All children will be accepted into our program on a trial basis. In addition to 3-5 year olds, some early elementary students may also be accepted into our afternoon program for after school care (3:00pm until close), based on availability and at the discretion of the Director.";"Preschool";"Pre-K Program";"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";"Other Non-Furry Animal";"After School, Before School, Full-Time, Part-Time";"American Sign Language, English, French, Other";"School Year Only";"08:30:00 to 15:30:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday";;;"Allergy Awareness";"5 Star";;2436

Our day consists of a learning circle, a group activity, and choice play. Our developmental areas include: a large open play area for blocks, puzzles, and games to build spacial awareness and cognitive skills; a library office for quiet/literacy time and literacy activities; an indoor and outdoor space with sand and water play for bouncing, climbing and gross motor activities; a kitchen for meals/cooking, science, arts/crafts-to encourage fine motor skills, self confidence and creativity. We also have a dramatic playroom for social and imaginative development. We incorporate daily; music, literacy, games/puzzles and sequencing activities as well as basic letter recognition and sounds, math, science and problem solving skills practice. Although children are supervised closely and monitored for appropriate behavior, we allow children the freedom to play and interact with creative expression and choice. We encourage children to cooperate and work through their struggles. We continually model polite response, give suggestions, help identify emotions and always guide them to be kind and work together; thus building social as well as cognitive skills during choice play time. At Little Crickets children play while practicing the social, life and kindergarten readiness skills that will set them up for a successful outlook on school, life and learning.

If we see a    situation starting to arise we try to redirect the child. We ask    children to use words to express their feelings and talk about how we    can use our words to alter any negative actions and turn them into a    positive learning exercise. To ensure all children are treated as    individuals and are provided with all the resources they need, each    child will have an informal evaluation upon entering Katie's    Educational Center. This will be done by both parents and staff    individually. With these observations, parents and teachers will    review and discuss goals as well as concerns that might arise. From    there, together we will derive an educational plan based on the    child'd needs. The child will be continually reevaluated. In knowing    each child' individual abilities we will ensure to use the    constructivist theory and have children work towards as much    independence on age appropriate developmental skills. When children    ask for help, teachers will not do the activity for them but model,    give ideas, and suggestions to help the child succeed. At Katie's    Educational Center, we do not encourage comparing children and    abilities. We treat each child as an individual and remind children    that we are all different and have unique strengths. If teachers and    or parents feel their child has a need that might need a specialist's    assistance, we would arrange a meeting and decipher what we should do    and/or contact to ensure the child will be getting the help they need.";"At Katie's Educational Center, we turn every occasion into a teaching moment.

A great resource explains the theory best, ""In constructivist preschool classrooms children are viewed as powerful and capable of seeking information that builds knowledge"" (Katz, 193). Mistakes are an essential part in learning, through trial and error children explore their surroundings and come up with solutions on their own or help with a peer. Teachers will provide scaffolding, which is a teaching method that enables a student to solve a problem, carry out a task, or achieve a goal through a gradual shedding of outside assistance. Children learn as they explore the world around them and the exploration provides an avenue for problem solving. As children explore, they develop new questions, and theorize answers. We believe that children benefit not only from structured learning but also playing/working with their peers. With this mentality, children are encouraged to help each other, and together they can come up with a solution in any situation. This is an extremely empowering learning skill, where children not only learn from helping but also learn it is ok to ask friends for help. At Katie's Educational Center, we encourage individuality but also teamwork and believe that together we can help each child grow and learn to their greatest potential.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool";;"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"House";"Dog";"Daytime, Full-Time";"English";;"07:30:00 to 17:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;;"4 Star";;274738

Our center works to    ensure that all students have the opportunity and support to share    personal and meaningful bonds with people in the school community.    Thoughtful direction and intentional planning are used to prevent    issues of concern and to encourage appropriate behavior. Oak Hill    staff model respectful and caring behavior. Focusing on    social/emotional development increases children's abilities to    regulate their emotions and behavior. Communicating consistent, clear    rules and involving children in problem solving help children develop    self-discipline. We encourage children to be fair, to be respectful of    other people and property, and to learn to understand the results of    their actions. Positive Guidance: The goal of positive guidance is to    help children develop self-control and become self-disciplined, to    develop an inner sense of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. We    think of this as offering guidance and being supportive and helpful to    the child. If a child exhibits an unacceptable behavior, we share the    acceptable behavior so the child can learn and understand what is    appropriate. We support verbal communication between children,    encouraging them to use their words to express their feelings. Helping    children learn to express themselves with self-control will help    develop self-confidence that they can solve problems on their own.";"Oak Hill is dedicated to a child centered curriculum and environment.

Children attending the program need to treat all members,    children and staff alike, with respect and consideration. Program or    school materials/property need to be utilized appropriately.

Staff model the appropriate behavior or redirect children to    a more acceptable activity to better facilitate the development of    self control in children. Time out is used as a last resort. Physical    contact in disciplining a child is not used, unless it is necessary to    prevent a child from harming him/herself or another person. At no time    will a child be subjected to embarrassment, ridicule, humiliation or    verbal or physical abuse. A child whose behavior dictates time away    from an activity will be asked to sit and get him/herself under    control. Parents are asked to notify the program of any change at home    that may impact on the child's behavior or participation in the    program. Certain behaviors are totally unacceptable and will result in    an automatic daily suspension from the program. Parents will be called    to pick up their child that day and the child may not return on the    next scheduled day of attendance. Payment for both days will still be    expected. Suspension will result for the following behaviors: 1.    Profanity/obscene gestures towards adults or other students. 2.    Destruction of school or program property. *3. Serious fighting. 4.

My guidance policy is as follows: To    assist children in developing self-control, self confidence, and    sensitivity in their interaction with others,and to ensure order,    prevent injury, and ensure a child's activities are not infringing on    the rights of others, the following strategies are used to guide the    child's behavior; *Focusing on the child's behavior, rather than on    the child * Reinforcing appropriate behavior *Observing children in    order to anticipate potential difficulties *Establishing eye contact    and calling the child by name to gain a child,s attention * Remaining    near the child in situations where he/she may be losing self-control    *Modeling problem solving *Offering choices *Redirecting If all else    fails the child will be removed from the situation in a way that    ensures that the 'time out' is a positive learning experience. Prior    to the use of ' time out' the child will be given an explanation of    what it means and what it involves. The 'time out' place will be    located within the play area, where they can still be supervised, but    far enough from the activity. The child will be allowed to determine    when he/she can return to the activity. For preschooler age children    the 'time out' will be no more than 1 minute per year of age to a    maximum of 5 minutes. Appropriate or acceptable behavior of the child    following 'time out' will receive praise. If a child looses control    and could possibly injure him or herself or others, the child will be    held and helped to soothe themselves until self-control is gained. I    do not practice or allow the following behaviors; *Corporal punishment    such as shoving, hitting, shaking,or spanking. *Harsh, belittling or    degrading treatment. *Confinement, unsupervised separation from    others, physical restraint as punishment. * Depriving children of    meals,snacks,rest,or necessary use of the toilet as punishment.";"see parent handbook page 5 for daily schedule.

These early years are important to lay a strong foundation for your child's brain to grow, develop a strong sense of self-worth, efficacy, and independence, as well as a healthy appetite for learning. Honeycomb Kids is a home away from home-a place where children feel safe, loved, part of an extended community of new friends, and a place where the expectations upon them are appropriate-play, have fun, explore and grow! We value play and moral development with the highest esteem. A homecare is such a unique environment that allows your child to receive individual attention and explore in a safe and unintimidating environment. The small group setting allows children to experience the importance and significance of friendships, and through our tight social circle, moral development is learned first-hand. Your child most likely will be in a formal school setting for the next 18 years; so give your child the opportunity to enjoy extended periods of time in nature and in a peaceful home environment as long as they can! Our curriculums are both nature-based and play-based, child centered, and are often developed according to the children's observed emerging interests. We strive to highlight ecology and the interdependent nature of all things, so young minds are continually stretching to accommodate and assimilate new information in a relevant context. The promotion of healthy habits, healthy sense of self, the importance of community, and being a responsible steward for the natural world are emphasized. Social, emotional, and moral development are aspects that are seamlessly integrated into all curriculums. Again, 0ur program is modeled after Waldorf approaches and is also fully aligned with and registered as a Lifeways Program. (check out LifwaysNorthAmerica.org). We love being outside- in all seasons, and this is a cornerstone of our program. At Honeycomb Kids, we believe in the development of the -whole-child-- and that means eating local and organic food, playing music, dancing, spending unstructured time in nature, being wild and crazy and being still and silent, helping to take care of others, and learning how to stand up for ones beliefs, plus some of the basic academic expectations around math, literacy, and science. We encourage the older children to think for themselves, learn how to make their own choices, follow through with their plans, and learn first-hand the importance of being an individual within the context of our larger group. Our goal is to nurture healthy, respectful, empathetic, aware, and intelligent children who will have all the tools and support to succeed in life as both strong individuals and community members. Honeycomb Kids is a mixed age environment, and this sets us apart from center-based childcare. The older children are teachers and role models for the younger ones. The younger children naturally look up to the older children, and it is important for them to see where they are heading developmentally. The older children get to practice care-taking for the younger ones, and as the younger children grow up, they will demonstrate the same love and kindness their older -classmates- showed them. It is so sweet when you see a 4 year old helping a 2 year old with a puzzle, or helping to put on a boot or zip a jacket. Confidence building and positive self-worth happen naturally in common place instances like these. We use positive guidance and behavior management techniques that are developmentally appropriate for your child and focus on creating an atmosphere of sympathy and empathy for their friends and the natural world.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";"Food Program";"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Smoke Free";"House";"Dog";"After School, Before School, Full-Time, Part-Time";"English, Spanish";;"08:30:00 to 15:15:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday";"School Bus Route";"Brewster Pierce School, Jericho Elementary School, Richmond Elementary, Smilie Memorial School";"Allergy Awareness";"5 Star";;215989

Reinforcement, notice and praise - making children feeling important    and value. Telling them they did a good job and made a good choice.     Redirect - direct a child's attention to another program activity.     Time out - if a child's behavior remains inappropriate after several    attempts to redirect, then the child is placed in a time out.

We strive to set clear expectations from the start    and we build in time to intentionally practice following the    expectations and acknowledge behaviors that meet expectations.    Examples include:  setting clear boundaries in an outdoor play area,    practicing staying inside the boundaries, and acknowledging children    when they are inside the boundary. talking about the type of language    that we use at Fox Hollow, modeling and practicing using kind and    respectful language with each other, and acknowledging children when    they use kind and respectful language. We are also aware that    behaviorsgood or not so goodare communication, especially from our    youngest learners. Behaviors often communicate an unmet need. Our    teachers are committed to looking beyond the behavior so that they can    determine what the need is that is driving the behaviorwhether the    need is physical (eg. hungry), sensory (eg. dysregulation/sensory    overload), emotional (eg. frustration), or other. We believe that if    the teacher can address and meet the need, the childs behavior will    change. While we will acknowledge an unwanted behavior, we try not to    give the negative behaviors too much energy or attention. Instead, we    focus on setting clear expectations, determining needs, meeting needs,    and returning the child to the group in a calm and regulated state.";"The Mission of Fox Hollow Forest School is to provide full-time, year-round, joyful, nature-based care and education to preschoolers in the Greater Rutland area. Forest schools, also known as nature schools or forest kindergartens, are a type of early childhood education that takes place mainly outdoors in forests or woodlands. The program takes place outside in all but very extreme weather, and the children learn how to adapt themselves to the environment as it changes seasonally throughout the year. In forest schools, the learning is mostly child led. Teachers pay close attention to the things that the children observe and wonder about, and they facilitate further learning by presenting opportunities and materials for deeper exploration. In forest schools, children are given plenty of opportunities to take reasonable risks, engage in free play, and move their bodies to their hearts content. Childrens regular interactions with nature through daily hikes, free play, and planned seasonal activities act as the central organizing concept of the Fox Hollow Forest School curriculum. Nature is not just a topic or activity center, but the integrating thread that ties all the parts of the program together, including preschool philosophy, classroom design, methodologies, outdoor spaces, and public identity. Since nature is the main focus, academics are integrated in a meaningful way in the context of reality. The curriculum focuses on environmental interactions and authentic experiences. Our program aligns with the standards set forth in the Vermont Early Learning Standards (VELS) in 2 ways: through core routines and seasonal activities. Core routines are things that happen daily like hikes, circle time, quiet time, and free play. Here are some examples of how core routines meet VELS standards. Seasonal activities are lessons or activities that are planned and/or facilitated by the teachers like counting activities, learning about a certain topic, or art projects. These activities always follow both the season and the learners observed interests. Seasonal activities may take place during hikes, on site at specific locations, during circle time, or back at the indoor classroom. The assessment that we complete in the fall and spring is based on the standards set forth in the VELS. Daily Schedule Our typical day follows this schedule (but is flexible when necessary): 8:00-9:00 Arrival, outdoor and indoor play, breakfast, pack for morning hike 9:00-11:00 Hike to days site, circle time, explore, play, snack on site 11:00-12:00 Hike back, clean up, eat lunch (outdoors if possible) 12:00-1:30 Nap, quiet indoor play 1:30-3:30 Afternoon hike and exploration and/or playground fun closer to school, closing circle";"Preschool";"Food Program, Pre-K Program";"No";"Yes";;"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";;"Before and After School, Daytime, Full-Time";"English";;;"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;"Barstow Memorial School";"Allergy Awareness, Special Diets";"3 Star";;456495

Our practice is based in Emergent Curriculum, a    way of designing curriculum that is initiated by the children's    interests and passions with the teachers role as that of facilitator    and co-researcher. It is also Reggio-Emilia inspired, which focuses on    learning that is student-centered and sees the child as capable and    whole, while being firmly grounded in forming deep and meaningful    connections and relationships.

We know that many young children learn through kinesthetic (physical/movement) means, as well as through other styles of visual, verbal, aural, and logical means. We also know that children have different intelligences that come more naturally to them than others. We design our opportunities and experiences to be reflective of these skills and abilities. This includes regular opportunities for children to express themselves through art in its many forms with educators who specialize in art instruction and education. It also includes sensory exploration and fine motor development to create hands-on experiences that connect the mind and the body. Regular studio time is incorporated to offer students time for physical movement, group activities, and gross motor development, enabling students to meet their need for movement as well as help develop the larger muscle groups that in turn enable the smaller muscle groups to develop. Music is integrated into daily practice to promote language development, rhythm, mathematical concepts, and brings harmony and integration into the auditory system. We practice yoga and mindfulness to bring balance to the mind and body, enabling children to develop body awareness and self-regulation. We go outside to incorporate the natural world into the curriculum, and we bring natural elements into our classrooms because we know that being in nature promotes the development and accessing of self-regulation skills and emotional intelligence.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";;"No";"Yes";"Yes";"Yes";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";"Other Non-Furry Animal";"After School, Full-Time, Part-Time";"American Sign Language";;"07:30:00 to 17:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";"School Bus Route, City Bus Route";"Chamberlin School";"Allergy Awareness";"5 Star";;372680

Our school is inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy which views children as inquisitive learners who are deeply curious and capable. Experiences are planned to spark creativity, thinking, and reflection. Instructors develop emergent curriculum, responding to and encouraging the ever-changing interests of the students. Outdoor play is an essential part of our program. We are committed to providing daily opportunities for children to get outside, get moving, and connect with the natural world. Social and emotional skill development is of utmost importance during the preschool years. Clear communication and focused listening are encouraged and supported. We make every effort to provide a model of community that will sustain and enrich your child now and in the future. We support them in developing lifelong, heart-felt values. We promote self-understanding, practice empathy toward one another, respect for the environment, and engagement with the world at large. While nurturing and supporting each individual child, teachers also strive to encourage a sense of community and a sense of the importance of each child as a participating member of a group. We work to ensure a childhood experience filled with shared adventure and friendship. We respect and value the differences in each childs interests, developmental needs, and personality.

Young children develop it naturally when they believe in themselves, their abilities and their worth. It happens in an environment where they are allowed to make choices, decisions and sometimes mistakes. Learning always involves feelings. Young children must be allowed to freely express their emotions in a safe and validating environment if they are to learn and grow emotionally, as well as develop a healthy sense of self. If children feel safe, they can take risks, ask questions, make mistakes and learn to trust and share their feelings. If they are taken seriously, they will develop the ability to respect others. If their emotional needs are met, they will have the ability to develop empathy.

STEP 1: If the child continues to show disruptive    behaviors after the teachers have given the child guidance and    instruction, staff will document the behaviors and inform the    parent/family.

The purpose of this plan will be to help the child develop    self-control, gain independence in following routines and    responsibility, and become respectful within the classroom. STEP 3: If    the childs behavior persists, the child will be observed by the    director or coordinator of the program and meet with the teacher to    help determine the childs individual needs and to evaluate the    success plan. STEP 4: If the child continues to display the inability    to successfully participate in the current child care setting in a    1:10 teacher to child ratio a parent/family/director/coordinator    meeting will be arranged.

Schools Out will provide quality childcare that parents can rely on throughout the school year, as defined by the school district calendar and as indicated in the calendar section of this agreement. Our curriculum meets the Vermont Early Learning Standards (VELS) and is based on students interests and needs. During each unit the students will engage in a variety of activities revolving around math, language and literacy, science, social studies, creative expression, and physical/health skills. Each thematic unit will allow children time to pursue their own interests in a safe and friendly environment. Parents/Guardians are welcomed and encouraged to visit the program at any time to join their children in activities. Philosophy The foundation of Schools Out is a belief that all students should be given the opportunity to learn, develop, create, and explore in an environment that is safe, nurturing, and fosters the love of learning every day.

We recognize that    all children want to make the right choices, and sometimes need extra    support and care. We believe that it is important to recognize and    validate the very real emotions that children feel, and we give    children the time and space to discuss those emotions. We support    children to appropriately communicate how they are feeling to those    around them. We teach children to identify their emotions and we teach    them the appropriate skills needed to work through the tough emotions    they are experiencing . Along with supporting children through    communication, we use positive reinforcement, redirection, and    proactive planning to prevent problems. Positive reinforcement: The    child will be frequently praised and encouraged when displaying    appropriate behaviors. Redirection: The child will be redirected to    another activity. Planning ahead: Our educators plan ahead to prevent    issues from occurring. Our educators document challenging behaviors so    that we can better plan for the future. We do not believe in sending    children to ""time out,"" and avoid taking space unless it is absolutely    needed or the child requests it. We may encourage a child to ""take    space"" when they are hurting themselves, others, or equipment. Taking    space is a time when children can calm down, discuss the issue with a    trusted adult, and make a plan to reenter the activity. Taking space    is not meant as a punishment, but is used as a problem solving tool    that children will learn to voluntarily use in the future.";"Art or craft activities, circle time, daily outside play, dramatic play, regular daily routine, part-day Preschool program, sand and water play, songs or music activities, story time & literacy activities Our mission is to provide: -A safe and nurturing, learning environment that fosters each child's individual growth and development, -A program that promotes respect, community, exploring the outdoor world, and -An emergent curriculum that prepares children for the future, both academically and developmentally. -No child shall be discriminated against and deserves to be treated with respect -Our program will provide a safe, nurturing environment that fosters each child's individual growth and development -Every activity is a learning experience and we believe strongly in hands-on, play-based learning. -Our program will provide a curriculum that is child-centered and child-directed. By using a child-centered approach to education, our staff act not only as teachers, but also as facilitators to play and exploration. -Classrooms are full of different types of learners. We as educators believe that an effective curriculum needs to be wide-ranging, integrated, and inclusive. -Families of enrolled students are welcome at any time. We have an open-door policy and value having family members participate in our program. Risky Play: At ABC Academy and Discovery Roots, we believe in allowing the children to involve themselves in risky play, especially when outdoors with ample space to move and explore. We will encourage this type of play in a safe and controlled manner. Educators will position themselves close to a child in risky play (ie. climbing high, throwing materials, or swinging an item) so that they can intervene as necessary. Educators will be narrating the behavior so that the child will learn the language to communicate what they are doing while doing it in a safe way and how to think about their bodies in space. For example, ""I see that Johnny is right behind you, and you are swinging that big stick. You might need more space-where can you move your body? Okay, now say 'Back up! I'm swinging!'"" We will also help the children to set up ground rules around consensual play like pushing or tagging games. If they agree to the rules, the educator will be the referee to help make sure that the agreed upon rules are being followed. Words like warning, penalty box, and benched are words derived from sports and are easy for children to understand and follow. This allows for big body movement in a safe, agreeable way. Getting Messy at School: At ABC Academy, we spend a lot of time engaged in sensory activities, including slime, playdoh, cooking, the sandbox, and more! We also enjoy spending a lot of time outside in all weather, and we allow children to play in mud. You should expect your child to get messy when they are at ABC Academy!

Children grow and develop to their fullest capacity if given many opportunities to explore, create and problem-solve. Children learn best when they are engaged in active learning experiences that are appropriate to their developmental level, hands-on, relevant to their daily lives, and come directly from their backgrounds, interests, and talents. They develop emotionally and socially when provided with many opportunities to have quality adult and child interactions in both small and large group settings. All experiences planned for children focus on their needs and interests and incorporate educational objectives in a meaningful way. Children are encouraged to initiate many of their own activities, learn to solve problems independently, and to make many choices on a daily basis. Being encouraged and empowered to make choices such as who to play with, what materials to use, and what experiences they might engage in, helps them to feel a central part of the teaching and learning process. This promotes a stronger sense of self, and a higher level of intrinsic motivation. Cooperation and compromise becomes a component of social learning as the children experience and learn ways to interact in a group setting. Good Shepherd teachers are able to gear activities and interactions for individual children within the group setting. Activities and lessons are open-ended and child-centered, making it possible for all children to participate at their own level and in their own way. The environment, schedule, activities, and adult-child interactions are designed to foster childrens development in the following areas: Physical: Learning how ones body works in relationship to self, to space, and in relationship with objects and people. This includes large motor skills and experiences such as running, climbing, hopping, and moving to music and small motor skills and experiences such as placing puzzle pieces, grasping, cutting, stringing beads. Social/Emotional: Learning to separate from the family, developing independence, managing emotions, interacting with peers and adults, solving social conflicts such as sharing, learning to play cooperatively. Cognitive: Learning to problem-solve, make decisions, and conceptually understand and organize things, ideas and relationships in the environment. Language: Communicating with peers and adults, naming and describing objects and events in the environment, and expressing feelings and ideas.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";;"Yes";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";;;;"English";;"07:00:00 to 17:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;;"1 Star";;430141

We start by modeling appropriate    behaviors. The staff lets the children know what to do rather than    telling them what not to do. It is very important to show respect    before it is received. Treating a child respectfully has long term    effectiveness on their positive behavior. We let the children know    what is expected of them at the beginning of the day which leads to    positive behavior throughout the day because there is a clear    expectation of what is needed by each child. There is no unknown. Not    knowing what needs to happen as far as the daily schedule can lead to    angst. Angst in one child can be felt by the entire group and seamless    transitions are impossible. Positive discipline is a constant at Kids'    School. We encourage children to explain their feelings be it happy,    sad or frustrated. We then help to work through the feelings with the    child together which reinforces the trust between child and adult. The    Kids' School also gives attention to behaviors before they become an    issue. This will limit aggression and anxiety. We know that every    child is different and we embrace, as well as, accommodate    individuality as often as possible.";"The Kids' School is communication based in all our teaching methods. We feel communication is key with parents as well. Parents are a child's primary and most important teacher and we strive to support and keep parents involved with their child's early childhood experiences. The relationship between Kids' School staff and the families is so important to the growth of the child. Our relationship needs to be strong, open and communication filled in support of our family-program relationship philosophy. As required by CDD, our license is posted on the bulletin board and a copy of the regulation book is available for reading. Our license is renewed every three years. The Kids' School is a 4 STAR program. The Step Ahead Recognition System (STARS) is about going above and beyond the base line of the CDD's regulations. Being a part of STARS increases subsidy values, lets us collaborate with the public school system as a prequalified prekindergarten program and shows CDD that we are adding to our program to benefit your children.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool";;"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";"Other Non-Furry Animal";"Daytime, Full-Time, Part-Time";"English";;"07:30:00 to 16:30:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;"Stowe Elementary School, Thatcher Brook Primary School";;"4 Star";;438140

The curriculum is typically implemented after an idea    or interest area emerges from the group of children.";"Early Preschool Classroom (24 - 36 months): Maple Leaf offers an Early Preschool Program that encourages learning through play and experiences. The Classroom allows children to explore and master skills that are appropriate for their age. With an intention of positivity and success, the environment is designed to minimize the ""no,"" ""don't,"" and ""stop"" messages. This leads children to develop ownership of their classroom and learning. Preschool Program (3 - 5 years): Maple Leaf offers a Preschool Program that encourages exploration. The preschool classroom is equipped with multiple centers to choose from, as well as soft areas and quiet areas to retreat to. We make sure to furnish the classroom with a diverse collection of toys and books -- keeping boredom at bay. Maple Leaf practices Emergent Curriculum, so the children really get a sense of having ownership over what they learn. We encourage children to become engaged and to pursue one center at a time in their classroom.";"Toddler, Preschool";;"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";;"Daytime";;"In-Service Days";"07:30:00 to 16:30:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;"Allergy Awareness";"4 Star";;4684

Most importantly, I    always speak at the child's level & explain my clearly. I believe    children thrive in a loving, supportive environment where routines &    expectations are familiar. Give them the tools they need to develop    positive self-esteem, good communication, fine & gross motor skills &    they will become tomorrow's leaders. Because I take care of children    from six weeks to twelve years of age, teaching strategies for a group    can be challenging. Activities are geared so that older children can    engage with the younger children. As a result the older children    increase their skill sets by learning to be great listeners and    leaders while the younger children learn to communicate better. I am    constantly striving to assess children's needs. If I feel that I    cannot meet a child's needs, I will determine why. Is it a lack of    resources, materials, do certain activities need to be modified, or is    it possible the child needs to be evaluated by a professional &    receive specialized services? I discuss in a thoughtful way, how I am    meeting or trying to meet a child's needs with the parents & offer my    ideas on how best to address the situation. I encourage parents to    freely communicate any & all concerns about their child. I, in turn,    make sure each day parents are given an update on their child's day &    inquire about how they are feel their child is doing. I organize    events where my families can come together.

We know that children learn through play and support play-based learning in everything we do. We believe that young children learn best when they feel safe, valued and respected. We support trusting relationships with all stakeholders including families, teachers, staff and children. We believe that it is the role of each family to foster a childs development, and acknowledge that each familys culture is valuable and should be respected. We understand that the basis for all learning is a strong sense of self. For this reason, we support social-emotional development above all else and work to help children build skills which create a strong foundation in this domain of development. We believe that children benefit from engaging in experiences which act as mirrors of their authentic selves as well as those that serve as windows to discovery about cultures and people which are examples of diversity in our world. We draw inspiration from the NAEYCs position statement on Advancing Equity in Early Childhood Education. We believe that children who are curious and engaged will learn more from the things and people around them and encourage teachers to curate themes and topics which are of interest to the whole group. We seek to support each childs innate sense of joy and wonder. We support this by reflecting the childrens interests and needs in curriculum planning and responding to learning opportunities as they arise throughout each season, week and day. We believe that a rich environment fosters a passion for learning and that this environment includes safe spaces, trusting relationships, responsive caregivers and a variety of experiences available for all. We know that the natural environment provides countless opportunities for children to explore, grow and develop an understanding of the world around them. We nurture and support each childs individual learning path and facilitate their growth and development by encouraging them to make significant decisions about their days at Poker Hill School. We strive to create for children a sense of responsibility both for their school community and also for the broader world around them. We encourage each child to select their own chores, engage in long blocks of free play time, and choose many of their own activities. We support each childs growth as an autonomous individual within a caring and democratic community and strive to make each child realize their important place in an interconnected world where they can make a difference.";"Preschool";;"No";"Yes";"Yes";"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"Non-Residential";"Other Furry Animal";"Daytime, Part-Time";"English";"School Year Only";"08:00:00 to 15:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday";;;"Allergy Awareness";"5 Star";;2546

Inspired by the idea that all children encompass multiple    intelligences, and everyone has strengths to share, we manage    behaviors from a positive perspective. We view the environment and    curriculum as an additional teacher. A carefully planned space and    activities lead behaviors naturally in a positive direction, where    children are allowed to shine and show their best selves. Further, we    recognize that negative or disruptive behaviors are an expression of    needs and wants, and we can help children to meet such needs in a safe    and appropriate manner. In the Early Childhood Program this may look    like redirection, gentle reminders, adult intervention, talking    through a situation, or removing a child from an unsafe environment.    We see young children as unique individuals who are learning what it    means to express themselves, get their needs met, and engage with    others. Rather than forced apologies, we put the focus on checking in    with one another around feelings and safety, followed up by asking    what we can do to work towards a solution together. For young children    this is often an apology, or a hug, or the sharing of a toy. Working    through the process helps them to name & share their emotions, hear    others, and to work collaboratively to support a safe and welcoming    space in the classroom for all. When difficult situations arise with    older children, adults observe to see if the children are able to    handle the situation themselves and follow up by making observations    about what went well. Solutions may include redirection, engaging    children in creating solutions, and encouraging them to take ownership    over their own behavior and the effect it has in their learning    environments. We utilize a system for conflict resolution that we call    ""fire breaks."" It is a tiered process that allows children to step    away from the group, center themselves, and then share with an adult    and other children involved how they perceived the situation. We also    ask them to check in with others and ask how they are feeling.    Together, they will then work on solutions. Adults are present to help    as needed, but children lead so that the solution is authentic and    positive, and easily implemented. Once resolution has happened,    children rejoin the group. At all times, safety and respect are    non-negotiables, and we work to help children understand what that    means, and what it looks like. We expect that they may forget, have    questions, need guidance, and make mistakes. Through these processes    we are able to help children bloom into compassionate, respectful,    resourceful and responsible young people.";"Philosophy and Values: At Neck of the Woods, we firmly believe in a strengths-based approach to education and learning, and to social and emotional growth for children as well as their families and communities. Here, in the heart of the Mad River Valley of Vermont, we see ourselves as a vital thread woven into the tapestry of our community. With a child-centered approach to teaching a sense of place, a sense of self, and a sense of wonder, we encourage deep communication skills, collaborative play (& work!), natural affinity-building, academic growth, and holistic wellness. With inspiration from the Reggio Emilia approach to education, in connection with Howard Gardener's Multiple Intelligences, we strive to provide a high quality, developmentally appropriate environment.

Staff members provide a positive model of acceptable behavior.    Behavior guidance is tailored to meet the individual child's    developmental level. Our first attempt will always be to redirect    children and groups away from problems and toward constructive    activity in order to keep conflict to a minimum. The staff will use    various positive guidance techniques including Second Step, CSEFELS    and logical and natural consequences when there are no safety    concerns. Time-out will be used as a last resort and will be kept to 1    minute per year old.

Teachers provide guidance that helps students build their    self-esteem and become comfortable in the classroom community.    Teachers approach classroom management with Positive Behavioral    Supports. Behavior is a central mode of communication for children and    one that gives great insightinto a child's needs. This means teachers    will not use any treats or rewards or punishments such as time out.    Rather than developing morals, punishments and rewards merely keep    children obedient. Therefore, when a puzzling or disruptive behavior    occurs, teacher seek to find the purpose of the behavior, and strive    to find other ways for that student to have his/her needs met without    unduly impacting the learning community. Teachers strive to meetthe    need so that the undesirable behavior is unnecessary or provide the    student with tools so that s/he can get his/her needs met in an    appropriate way. Some of the Positive Behavior Supports you may see    include: A lap for a child to sit in at meeting; using humor to make a    child feel welcome in the classroom; creating spaces for a child to be    alone; defining areas of a classroom for louder voices and energetic    movements. Teachers helping students understand when they may need to    take a break from a classroom activity due to behavior choices that    are disrupting an activity or disturbing other children. Teachers do    not use the more punitive ""time out"" knowing that just removing a    child does not teach the child the necessary skills to successfully    participate next time. Instead, teachers use an instructional approach    sometimes called a ""time in"" or take a break, which involves actions    as sitting with a child to find out what is going on, validating the    child's feelings of being upset or hurt, and/or talking through what    is needed in order to rejoin the group. Problem Solving and Conflict    Resolution: At Bellwether, students, staff and parents are part of a    community working together toward a shared goal. Our teachers work    with students to establish classroom communities which in turn    contribute to the whole school community. Students work with their    teachers in establishing classroom rules and expectations. In conflict    situations, students problem-solve in order to to address the    conflict. A staff person may serve as a facilitator for this process    if the students are unable to resolve the conflict themselves. We    believe that the process of conflict resolution is a learning    opportunity for our students. The skills developed in this process    will support them into adulthood.";"Educational Philosophy and Core Principals: Holistic education aims to nurture and develop the varied interrelated capacities of the human being. Thus, while it addresses the intellectual development, it is equally concerned with the child's development as a physical, emotional, artistic, social, moral, and spiritual being. It aims to create a person who is well-rounded and in a broad sense healthy, a human being who has developed each aspect of his or her humanity.-Ron Miller, Founder. A holistic approach recognizes the interconnected nature of child's learning and development. It is an integrative approach and its highest goal is the cultivation of relationships between and within the learner and their world. Meaningful relationships between self, society, humanity and nature, intellect and emotion, adult and child, history and the present, and so on. What does holistic education at Bellwether look like? What are the principles that support the Bellwether philosophy? What is it about what we do and how we do it that brings everything together and results in compassionate, curious, responsible young children? We feel it can be boiled down to three words: Engage, Inquire, Emerge. These three words are at the heart of every moment and interaction at Bellwether. It is how we think about Explore choices and workshop concepts. We find chances for all of us to ENGAGE with the world, INQUIRE about new experiences and learning and EMERGE with deep understanding and connection. Looking at learning with these three words in mind allows us to approach our daily lives in the classrooms with a sense of investment and opportunity. Our Principles: a. We a support and are responsive to each child's whole development including intellectual, social, emotional, artistic, physical, and spiritual development. b. We draw forth intrinsic motivation of each child so that learning becomes an interactive process that values imagination, creativity and joy. c. We encourage members of our learning community to understand, honor, and respect diversity and to pursue this in their actions. d. Our teachers build relationships, allow students to construct their own learning, and foster the inquiry and critical thinking skills that inspire a child's connection to his/her world. e. We teach children to honor the rights of the individual and embrace responsibility to community. f. We develop in children an understanding of how to live harmoniously with the environment both now and over time.

We redirect inappropriate behaviors, give visual and verbal    cues for appropriate behavior, and recognize and encourage children's    efforts to make appropriate choices. We promote self-regulation skill    building by helping and encouraging children to identify their    feelings and those of others, and to use words to resolve problems and    conflicts...Sometimes, no matter how respectful and understanding we    are, children will make inappropriate choices and test the limits of    acceptable behavior. We help guide children through these times by    reassuring and acknowledging feelings and encouraging children to    spend time in our quiet spaces until they regain control, all while    reinforcing our clear and consistent boundaries...We believe that the    focus of guidance is on building a child's self-regulatory skills.    Helping children preserve their dignity in all situations is    essential. When they are treated with respect, when their feelings are    listened to and acknowledged, when they know what the expectations    are, children develop positive self-esteem and confidence in their    abilities.";"Unlimited strives to help children and families to be the best they can possibly be at any given time.

These may include art, sand/water play, blocks, dramatic play, manipulatives, science, writing center, and early literacy. Additionally, our curriculum provides opportunities for experiences with music, movement, cooking, math, social studies, field trips and other enrichment opportunities. We follow the guidelines set by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and the Vermont Early Learning Standards (VELS). All Y Youth Development programs strive to teach children in an inclusive environment. This includes the physical environment, behaviors, and attitudes of our staff.

Our    approach to behavior guidance is based on the principle that children    learn primarily through observation and practice: 1. We establish    clear guidelines and model safe and respectful treatment of self and    others, as well as proper use and clean up of equipment, and use    gentle reminders as needed. 2. We help children learn to use their    words and develop language to express their needs and preferences. 3.    We recognize that children often benefit from a quiet space, like a    Cozy Corner, to calm down, or have alone time as needed. Children    learn to recognize when they need to utilize this space for    themselves, and may also be guided to seek quiet time when necessary.    This is always taught as a self-regulation strategy and not as a    ""time-out."" 4. We recognize that each child is unique and work hard to    get to know each child so that they can be supported and challenged to    be their best self.";"Worcester Sprouts, Vanessa Weinstein's Registered Family Child Care Home, provides care to children ages 12 months and older. We are located just off a paved road one mile from Worcester Village.

At Worcester Sprouts, the themes of Connection with Nature, Play-Based and Child-Directed Learning, Social-Emotional Development, Community, and Equity are woven into a structured, but flexible day that includes much time outdoors. During outdoor and indoor play and exploration times, children are offered choices in the areas of sensory stimulation, fine and gross motor movement, creative arts, literacy and language, math, science, and social studies. Projects, materials, and toys are always guided by child interests. Worcester Sprouts also strives to support and engage parents and caregivers through strong communication and regular community events.";"Infant, Toddler, Preschool, School Age";"Food Program";"No";"Yes";;"No";"Fenced Yard, Smoke Free";"House";;"Daytime, Full-Time, Part-Time";"English, Spanish";;"09:00:00 to 17:00:00";"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday";;;"Allergy Awareness, Special Diets";"3 Star";;453835
