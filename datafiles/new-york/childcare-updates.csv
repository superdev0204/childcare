All children desire to explore and acquire knowledge, even at a very young age. Creating experiences that excites this interest, in conjunction with an atmosphere that encourages growth and independence, is crucial in fostering their desire to learn and developing a greater capacity to learn later on. Our philosophy also builds on Piaget's belief that all children learn through the active exploration of their environment. This belief agrees with our constructivist, child-centered approach to education. Cooperative learning is an approach and a set of strategies specifically designed to encourage children's cooperation while learning. We believe cooperative learning increases children's involvement and therefore their motivation to learn. The focus of our program supports and promotes young children to develop meaningful connections across several disciplines through functional, constructive and dramatic play.

Therefore, we believe that it’s critical to give them the opportunity to find their interests and discover their talents as soon as possible. We think that there’s no better way to help facilitate this than by providing a highly nurturing environment and by filling every day with music, dance, art and dramatic play. Our strong music and dance programs along with our recitals (two per year) are some of the things parents like best about us.

We also believe that young children need to be prepared for the world ahead. So we gently guide them in hands-on activities that foster skills like reading, writing, counting, measuring, and discovering science. We also immerse them in Spanish, which at this age, is the optimal time to awaken language receptors in the brain, making it easier to learn other languages later in life.

“We’ve worked to create a very special place,” states owner Melody Stevens. “And, we wanted a school that not only had exceptional teachers, but small class sizes to ensure that all students get individual help and attention.”

“Teaching children how to read & write is not enough,” says director Dylan Glanzer. “Our goal is to teach children how to learn. We want to stimulate their unique, creative ideas and talents by exposing them to a well-rounded program in music, art, drama, dance and academics.”

Furthermore, children need to learn social and personal skills: the classroom environment offers opportunities for applying skills that promote cooperation, negotiation, leadership and teamwork– as well as physical fitness and motor skill development.

Finally, we believe in giving back to our community, and we firmly believe that the arts and academics belong side by side in education. To that end, we have partnered with the NYC-based charity “Education Through Music”. (This organization provides music education in NYC inner-city schools in need. www.etmonline.org) For every student that registers with us, a child in an under-served public school receives music education as a core subject.

Our Preschool fosters a life-long quest and love for learning, building a strong foundation for social, emotional, academic, physical and spiritual growth.  We are the only Preschool in South Brooklyn that is Reggio Emilia inspired.

We offer small classes with low student to teacher ratios in an atmosphere stimulating multiple intelligences.  Our educators are specialists in early childhood development.

Our classrooms are our “third teachers”. Everything in them provides an opportunity for learning and growing. They are large, bright, warm and natural.

Every child is unique, with his/her own interests and learning styles.  We provide our children the space and opportunity to interact and play in a meaningful environment.   We are a place where children can construct new ideas and discover the world around them.  They are inspired to think, reason, question and experiment through play and hands-on activities.

The curriculum is inspired by Reggio Emilia designed to combine learning through self-discovery and teacher guidance.  This encourages children to gain confidence and experience cooperative relationships with both peers and adults, all in an atmosphere of inspiration and growth filled with joy, laughter, and developmental and academic excellence.

Social relationships are crucial in so many areas of life, and a positive preschool experience is one of the most important keys to a child’s future success in connecting with other people. Children are born intrinsically social and we want to be right there to help them navigate social experiences and gain social skills.   Teachers encourage children to use words to express themselves, model how to resolve conflicts, and facilitate the development of empathy and concern for others.

We believe that the most important goals of our school is to enhance our children’s self esteem, to respect each child as an individual, to foster social-emotional growth, to create a sense of community and family, and for our children to be stimulated and inspired to construct their own knowledge and “own” their daily experiences.";"http://www.chabadneshama.com/templates/section_cdo/aid/1503731/jewish/Neshama-Preschool-Brighton-Beach-Brooklyn.htm";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chabad-Neshama-Center/255018744519712";;;"http://www.chabadneshama.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/1800926/jewish/Application.htm";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";;"http://w1.chabad.org/images/shluchim/minisites/themes/preschool/preschool_banner_image.jpg";"http://w3.chabad.org/media/images/791/QyWe7910103.jpg";"http://w3.chabad.org/media/images/791/bOpT7910108.jpg";"http://w3.chabad.org/media/images/790/nlrS7906648.jpg";;

Our young learners, ages 2 to 6, benefit from a flexible approach to education that allows each child to be appropriately challenged in a nurturing environment.

Here at Plymouth, children’s voices are heard and their ideas are respected. Children are given the time and space to use their imaginations and tell stories of their own while listening to and sharing the stories of others.

Our carefully designed spaces—including nine classrooms, an art atelier, library and music room, plus our expansive gymnasium and outdoor playground—inspire discovery and learning. Access to rich materials helps build an understanding of the natural and man-made environment.

Children of all religious traditions, ethnic origins, and economic backgrounds are welcomed at Plymouth Church School.";"http://www.plymouthchurch.org/contact";;;;"http://www.acswebnetworks.com/plymouth/school_program/article388335.htm?links=1&body=1";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";;"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/2745/kids3.jpg";"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/2745/Kids2.jpg";"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/2745/kids13.jpg";"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/2745/kids5.jpg";;

The program provides a comprehensive child development program to meet the children�s educational, emotional, social, health and nutritional needs.

The program targets parents who are required to participate in welfare-to-work programs and helps them develop job-related skills by offering them opportunities to work as volunteers in the center. The Head Start program has been instrumental in providing early education opportunities to children who are at high risk of experiencing poor developmental outcomes due to the multiple socio-economic stressors impacting their families.

All children ages 2 1/2 through 5 years are welcomed at our center. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help you with your child.

Our goal is to teach your children through play how to socialize, express themselves, and to be proud of their accomplishments in a Safe and Happy Environment. Children are active learners, and will be taught through hands-on involvement. All interactions that your child will experience while attending Ring Around the Rosie will be positive in nature.

Our positive guidance and discipline will always be in a gentle but firm manner. We want our children to learn how to express their feelings so that we can help them to learn self esteem. Acceptable behavior and self-control will also be taught. At no time will a child be disciplined for failing to eat, sleep, or soiling themselves.

Ring Around the Rosie Pre-School is located in Island Heights, a quiet town that is approximately one square mile. It is a small boro within Toms River. We have been serving Toms River and the local community for nine years. Ring Around the Rosie is conveniently located one turn off of Route 37 in Toms River.

Our highly trained and professional staff has continued to grow with us for over 10 years. We welcome you to come in and see the school and become part of the Ring Around the Rosie Family.

We want to prepare our students to the best of our ability, before they must go forth in their schooling. Our goal is accomplished by developing strong theoretical knowledge and then allowing students hands on practice and use of the newly acquired knowledge.

As an educator I feel it is imperative to communicate the goals and standards, which are high but realistic. Our program is designed to give your child a solid academic foundation, which is most important in their early years of school. We also focus on the development of your child's social skills, which when combined together produces great results. Your child will be academically prepared and socially adjusted to confront the challenges they will face in the elementary school years. Smart Stars Academy is designed in both a stimulating and creative atmosphere. Our small class sizes will encourage your child to listen, learn, and interact with our skilled staff. Each child will have more one-on-one attention and support. Our classes are age specific, so are all the toys, books, and materials in each classroom.

When you join Smart Stars, your child is embarking on an exciting journey of socialization and academics. Smart Stars has been created to meet the great community need for quality full-time day care and preschool.

Involving parents is a critical aspect of any child’s education process and success. Therefore, we are devoted to working alongside the parents of each child in order to build a strong foundation for each child. Our students will achieve the goals set forth for them, but most importantly they will have fun as they’re doing so.

Smart Stars wants to provide a place where children can flourish academically, socially, and most importantly as individuals. We want our facility to be a safe, fun, and happy place for children to come and learn.

Located in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the Center provides excellent temporary housing, day care, infant care, and other services to 97 families at a time, assisting them in their search for employment and affordable housing.  In 1994, we added permanent housing for 33 low-income families in an adjacent building including ten families who relocated from the Center, and in 2004, we opened a new building across the street for 35 families. 

 St. John’s Place is a well regarded neighborhood organization that receives funding for youth and adult programming from both New York City and New York State government agencies, as well as from foundations and corporations.  The agency has a strong track record of working with other community groups in Crown Heights and, for the past ten years, has co-sponsored an annual street festival with community leaders and has provided meeting space for local groups. 

Through the St. John’s Place Family Center, HDFC (Housing Development Fund Corporation), we have finished the gut rehabilitation of a vacant, city-owned building located immediately adjacent to its facility.  The structure will serve as a new Career and College Access Center to help Family Center residents, unemployed young adults, and other community members obtain better employment opportunities.  The Center is scheduled to open in the Fall of 2014 with the help of rehabilitation funds awarded by Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz and City of New York, and grant support from The Lavanburg Foundation, The Brooklyn Community Foundation, and National Grid.  

With support from a 2010 Housing for Everyone Grant from TD Charitable Foundation, we completed two projects to further revitalize St. John’s Place.  In March 2011, we successfully renovated the basement of 1615 St. John's Place into office and classroom space that now houses our DREAMS/Youthbuild program.  With funds from two Article 8A loans from the City, we also completed energy-efficiency improvements and building repairs at St. John’s Place Family Center and 1610 St. John’s Place. The buildings received new heating plants including energy-efficient boilers, hot water heaters and storage tanks; roof replacements and repair of the parapets and copings; masonry repointing (replacing brick mortar) throughout the buildings’ façades; and all new windows.  In addition, we replaced all child guards and concrete walkways and installed a centralized surveillance system to provide real-time, web-based surveillance of all public areas.  This work, completed in Summer 2012, lowered energy costs and improved the comfort and safety of 130 very low-income families, the majority of whom have been homeless.  Additional funding by the Citi Foundation in 2013 and 2014 helped us to complete energy-efficient electrical improvements at the Family Center through local utility provider Con Edison's Multi-Family Energy Efficiency Program, and to conduct a feasibility study for interior renovation for which we are currently seeking capital funding.  

In the Summer of 2013, the Center welcomed volunteers from the New York Horticultural Society's Green Team, New York Cares and others to begin the restoration of a neighborhing community garden for use by the St. John's Place Day Care and Family Center, as well as others in the community.

    A child has a need for both physical and mental order for positive progress
    High on the list of educational tools needed is forming a solid foundation in self-confidence.
    A child needs to foster relationship and interaction with those around him
    A preschool environment is one which is structured to facilitate growth emotionally, intellectually, physically and socially.

In eight years the Co-op School has matured from a small, parent-run playgroup to a fully staffed and licensed non-profit school. The Co-op School is a parent-aided organization where “cooperative” means just that: students’ families are responsible for the development, fundraising and maintenance of the school. The Board of Directors is comprised of elected parents. Parents share the responsibility of upholding the school’s guiding principles, facilitated through the elected Board. With the staff, parents and student body, we continuously work towards our ultimate goal of blending community and education, with special attention to honoring our differences.

After residing in two prior homes in Clinton Hill, The Co-op School was thrilled to move into 87 Irving Place in Fall 2009. The facility boasts six classrooms for two and three-year-olds, two rooftop playgrounds, a science room, a library, and a large ground floor recreation room.

In 2011 The Co-op School launched the first kindergarten class of its elementary program in a beautiful building on Brevoort Place. Our new elementary school location at 40 Brevoort Place currently houses our kindergarten as well as two pre-k classrooms, a library, art and music rooms and a rooftop playground. A new grade will be added each year for the next 5 years: first grade in 2012; second grade in 2013; third grade in 2014; fourth grade in 2015; fifth grade in 2016.

The Co-op School has an executive director, a business director, 20 full-time teachers and a custodian, all full of love and experience. We maintain a 5:1 student to teacher ratio and never fall below the state mandated ratio.

Daily enrichment activities, including Cooking, Music, Art, Show and Tell, and Movement, are taught by our staff.";"http://www.thecoopschool.com/space-rentals/";"https://www.facebook.com/thecoopschool";;;"http://www.thecoopschool.com/admissions/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";;"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10402441_10152439123668936_6394781785160671238_n.jpg?oh=0696c1fc6c9b165176f58751fddda994&oe=5452888B&__gda__=1414882162_9ef120df23a10e8ae3637989c19c8209";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/p480x480/10351680_10152439123813936_3224455658364201895_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10463046_10152439123598936_5670562949209366422_n.jpg?oh=8913bb419b6f4658d154f1c8ade1f730&oe=5443730C&__gda__=1413892890_30889ae145edac208e3fc81544e078c8";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10389651_10152439122633936_8643015194992064845_n.jpg?oh=327876c2e69365567f595a0cd0427f00&oe=544A0D6B&__gda__=1415208061_77da43e4e3960388ff0d6931644d626a";;

Children construct their knowledge about the world through interaction with the people and materials in it. We value the development of a child’s mind, body and spirit and we respond to the individual needs of each child. We facilitate each child’s social, emotional, cognitive and physical development through child-initiated activities.

We are dedicated to stimulating the innate curiosity of each child and supporting emotional growth and expression. We believe in respecting individual differences in temperament, learning styles, creativity and personal needs. We encourage students to express feelings honestly and to deal respectfully with the feelings of others. We believe preschool is an extension of home, a place where each child is nurtured in a warm, caring atmosphere. Maple Street is a supportive environment where teachers help students feel safe to take risks that lead to true growth.

At Maple Street, we encourage students to explore the world around them based on their interests and development. We offer programs in art, music and dance to help children develop their language, intuition, concentration, reflection, reasoning and decision-making skills. Academic skills are presented when children are ready and are usually incorporated into ongoing studies or daily rituals and routines.

The Maple Street School ensures children have a rich, interactive, creative preschool experience, and that they are prepared for their journey into kindergarten and beyond.";"http://maplestreetschool.org/";;"9-6PM, Monday-Friday";;"http://maplestreetschool.org/admissions/";"http://maplestreetschool.org/?post_type=coop-docs";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://maplestreetschool.org/wp/wp-content/themes/mss/img/mss_logo_b.png?02788d";"http://i1.wp.com/beta.maplestreetschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Maple_Street_School_02.jpg?resize=620%2C413";"http://i2.wp.com/maplestreetschool.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wind_school_940x400.jpg?resize=620%2C263";"http://i2.wp.com/beta.maplestreetschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Maple_Street_School_06.jpg?resize=220%2C330";"http://i1.wp.com/beta.maplestreetschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/MSS_2_29_12_slides-15.jpg";;

They use all of their senses to investigate their world and the people within it. Classroom materials and programs are designed to encourage and enrich this exploration. Teachers act as guides, extending the children’s thinking, setting reasonable limits for their behavior, and helping them grow as independent learners.

Parents play a key role in the successful nursery school program. At WNNS parents are welcome visitors in the classroom throughout the school year and are expected to stay at school with their children during the initial separation process.

Treasure Island Preschool has long been serving the children and families of Bay Ridge since 1985. Throughout the years, our program has always stressed the view that all children are unique individuals with unique abilities and interests that need to be nourished and supported. It is firmly believed that by capitalizing on children's strengths and interests they will be appropriately engaged in learning that will promote a strong sense of self-worth, develop a great sense of self-esteem and self-confidence, and promote a love of learning and discovery. 
 
The curriculum at Treasure Island emphasizes the development of the whole child. Our learning environment is designed to promote social/emotional development, physical development, cognitive development and language and literacy development for all of our children.The curriculum emphasizes child choice within a classroom organized around interest areas such as blocks, art, science, math, dramatic play, and literacy.  In these learning centers, teachers work with children individually or within small groups to guide and facilitate their learning. The program stresses a balanced approach between child initiated learning and using direct teacher instruction. Another key emphasis of the curriculum is creating a classroom community and establishing secure relationships which will support children's enthusiasm and engagement in learning. Strong parent partnerships are seen as key and essential in helping children to grow and develop.
 
Our program is currently licensed by the Department of Health, accredited by the State Education Department and became accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) in May 2011. Our program is also part of the New York State Quality Stars Project.

Seventy years ago the Friediker Rebbe landed on the shores of America. Addressing the thousands of Jews that came to greet him at the water front, he declared, ""America iz nit anderish -America is not different than pre-war Europe. Just as Judaism has flourished in Russia , Poland , Hungary, and the like, it will flourish in America."" In the Rebbe’s pursuit of proving America is not different, he began Lubavitcher Yeshiva in Brooklyn. From just 10 original bochurim Yeshivas Tomchei Temimim has flourished and educated thousands of Talmidim. The United Lubavitcher Yeshiva’s primary goal is to establish a foundation for learning in a warm and nurturing yiddishe environment. The Yeshiva concentrates on creating a child friendly environment that addresses individual development. By encouraging each child individually, each child feels nurtured through his own experience and level.  These talmidim take what they learn through preschool, elementary and premesivta with them for years to come. The foundation that is laid down in the early years becomes an integral part of the rest of a child’s life. The partnership our Yeshiva builds with our parent body is a crucial investment in klal yisroel.  The Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, asserted that the impact of studying in Tomchei Temimim is everlasting:

Our mission in creating the Wizard Of Oz Daycare is to provide a comfortable, safe, and stimulating environment that’s warm and inviting for children to develop at their own pace. It is a place where children will receive the individual attention and care that they need to mature and acquire knowledge at this important stage of their lives; it is the place where children feel safe and secure and where parents can take comfort in knowing that their children are receiving the highest level of care. Your child will enjoy enhancing their social, emotional, intellectual, cognitive, and motor skills while building confidence and self-esteem.

At Our Preschool, we believe it is never too early to encourage a love of learning!
Children learn through play. Play contributes to the building of gross motor, fine motor,cognitive, sensory, social and emotional skills. Our curriculum is supported by a stimulating environment allowing children to explore, problem solve and learn through their interaction with their surroundings and other children through self-directed play. The environment, activities, and social interactions of our program are designed to stimulate individuality, positive self-esteem, communication skills and a lifelong desire to learn. Our classrooms are designed and equipped for developmentally appropriate play. We evaluate and maintain our classroom programs, materials and equipment.

Our centers offer nurturing learning environments focused on the social, emotional, physical and academic development of children aged 2-5. With an evidence-based curriculum and a proven instructional methodology, we ensure that each child enters elementary school prepared to succeed. Children cultivate intellectual curiosity and develop positive learning habits through activities designed to promote early literacy, develop basic math skills, introduce them to science and technology and promote creative expression through the arts. Approximately 200 children participate in early learning, HeadStart and Universal Pre-K in our centers.

Each early learning center is licensed by the New York City Department of Health and accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. Our teachers are New York State certified, and all staff members undergo background clearances and participate in ongoing professional development.

The YWCA believes a parent is a child’s first teacher. To support and cultivate parents and guardians in leading their child’s development, the YWCA hosts parent workshops, curriculum discussions and special events. Along with the parent advisory committee, the YWCA also sponsors field trips, parent socials and other networking activities.

The YW partners with community leaders and institutions to provide additional resources in support of the development of core cognitive and social competencies. We currently have partnerships with Brooklyn Public Library, The Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY), Cool Culture, New York State Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (Health Bucks program) Social Science and Human Services Department-Borough of Manhattan Community College, Adelphi University, School of Social Work, Hunter College School of Social Work and Fordham University, School of Social work.";"http://www.ywcanyc.org/brownsville-elc/";"https://www.facebook.com/ywcanyc";;"http://www.ywcanyc.org/get-involved/jobs/";;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.ywcanyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ywca-nyc-logo-small.png";"http://www.ywcanyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/early-learning-thumb-large.jpg";;;;;

Our highly experienced and credentialed faculty is committed to nurturing a sense of wonder and to discovering each child’s capabilities and ways of learning. This approach creates the foundation for provisioning the classroom and for curriculum planning. Play is understood as a child’s academic searching and an expression of intelligence and growth. Through the process of their engagement with play, and the project approach to learning - from inquiry, discussion, activity and reflection, to documentation - children can realize endless possibilities for discovering meaning and relationships. In order to achieve this, they are given time and space for exploration and further involvement. Each child is appreciated for his or her contributions to the process.

One-on-one, small group and whole class learning takes place within and beyond the walls of the school, incorporating the natural world and introducing children to broader social and environmental contexts. As they participate fully in their classroom community, children are encouraged to reflect on their work and to become thoughtful, active, and responsible learners.

Named after a nearby park, the school relocated six years later to its present location in Waterside. Here, the nursery school has developed a fine reputation that reaches beyond the Waterside community into the New York educational community.

At Bellevue South Nursery School, we welcome parents into the community. In our experience, children become more eager learners when parents actively support the educational process. Bellevue South provides parents with the opportunity to meaningfully encourage the early education of their children.

Philosophically, we draw on multiple outlooks, believing that just as each child is different, so too our classroom should reflect different learning styles, rather than rigidly adhering to one pedagogical approach. We love Montessori manipulatives and independent learning, and we also believe in listening to each child and engaging them where they're at, as does the Reggio Emilia approach. We
believe strongly in the power of play, and in the individual relationships between students and teachers. Our wonderful teacher/student ration allows us to engage students on an individual basis.

Our original small group of seven 2-year-olds has grown to two schools comprising approximately 200 children and a professional community of collaborative educators.

We integrate the Reggio Emilia educational model in our curriculum.  The Reggio approach focuses on the “whole child” through creative exploration and play, supporting each child’s cognitive, physical, emotional and social growth. 

The programs at Buckle My Shoe empower children to build self-esteem and confidence in their ongoing development.  We offer the structure which is fundamental for individual growth in an atmosphere where children never lose their thirst for learning, and in which their curiosity and accomplishments guide the curriculum through art, music, movement (dance, yoga and gym) literacy, math, science, and social studies.

The multi-cultural educational environment allows children and their parents to recognize early the qualities they possess which will later enable them to make their mark on society.";"http://www.bucklemyshoe.org/";;;;"http://www.bucklemyshoe.org/index_files/bmsadmissions.htm";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.bucklemyshoe.org/index_files/image740.jpg";"http://www.bucklemyshoe.org/index_files/image773.jpg";"http://www.bucklemyshoe.org/index_files/image788.jpg";"http://www.bucklemyshoe.org/index_files/image1017.jpg";;

We provide a warm, loving, nurturing environment where children are encouraged to develop their full potential emotionally, socially, physically and intellectually.  We are fortunate to have very experienced and talented teachers who genuinely enjoy working with young children.  Parents, Teachers and Administrators form a strong partnership to offer the highest quality education to our young children.
﻿
Children are encouraged to choose activities from a myriad of learning materials geared to their individual levels of achievement.  They are encouraged to persist at tasks, always bringing them to completion.  Confidence building activities promote the motivation to accomplish more challenging goals.

Preparing children to read and write proficiently is an important component of the Cathedral Parkway Towers Preschool program.  The children are offered literature through interesting and informative activities. They are read to often throughout the day and are given opportunities for exploration of letters and numerals.

When the Cravath Children’s Center opened in 1989, it was the first employer-run, on-site child care facility in New York City. This special place, recently renamed The Christine Beshar Children’s Center, is available free of charge to all employees and provides back-up child care when regular child care arrangements fail—for example, if a child’s school is closed or work requires the employee parent to be at the office on a weekend or holiday. Upon returning to work after the birth or adoption of a child, parents may also bring their child to the Children’s Center on a regular basis for up to six months, space permitting. The Children’s Center includes a dedicated infant area as well as separate preschool and school-age sections. It is open on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and on weekends and holidays from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

In January 2010, the Children’s Center adopted a new name in honor of its founder, Christine Beshar. When Christine Beshar was elected the first female Partner at the Firm, she paved the way for working mothers at Cravath. With four children, a successful career and a husband with a demanding career of his own, Christine raised the issue regarding the challenges that parents encounter when raising children while working full time. Her own experiences led her to envision a place that Cravath employees could rely upon to watch their children in an emergency. The concept behind the Cravath Children’s Center has become the model for many other ‘‘My son loves the Children’s Center and I love how comfortable I feel leaving him there, knowing he is in warm, capable hands just an elevator ride away. The people who work there are fantastic with him and he never seems to get bored with all there is to do—art, music, bubbles, toys and more.’’ Fourth-year Litigation Associateorganizations that recognize the scheduling and balancing challenges that many employees with children face.

The Christine Beshar Children’s Center is a friendly, safe and fun place where children feel comfortable and parents are confident that their children are nearby and well cared for.

The environment and the program are carefully planned to meet the needs of the young child for play, socialization and individual attention. The curriculum is flexible and recognizes the importance of each child as a distinct personality, developing at its own pace. However, there is a regular, constant sequence of daily activities and a clear order in arrangement of materials and equipment to help the child gain self-confidence. Routines are introduced from the start for the same reason.

We believe in developing children’s positive self-image with wholesome attitudes about themselves, school and learning. We encourage their quest for knowledge and help them express themselves in a variety of art media, movement and language by providing them with the time, materials and opportunities to do so. We plan and implement experiences for the children designed to facilitate optimal cognitive development. Our curriculum framework and general activity areas and materials in the classroom generate the specifics of the cognitive curriculum.

";"Welcome to First Friends Pre-School, a neighborhood nursery school tucked into the tree-lined streets of New York City’s Upper West Side.  Amidst the hustle and bustle of urban life, our caring teachers and homey classrooms provide an oasis for busy families looking to offer their children a gentle introduction to the world of school.  Our child-centered approach in the classroom promotes a low-key atmosphere where our students can grow and flourish. Since our founding in 1979, our work at First Friends has been guided by the needs of our children, as individuals and as part of a group.  We understand that pre-schoolers come to us at different developmental levels and that the pace of their progress is personal.  We know that we must meet the children at their own level in order to help them progress.  At the same time, we appreciate the importance of positive social experiences with peers as essential building blocks for later happiness and success in life.  By creating nurturing relationships based on trust, our teachers discover the strengths and interests of each student and draw on these to advance their learning in all the domains of early childhood development:  social/emotional, cognitive, language and physical.

George Com­mu­nity Enrich­ment Cen­ter, Inc. was founded and incor­po­rated in 1981 for the pur­pose of estab­lish­ing, main­tain­ing, and oper­at­ing pro­grams in edu­ca­tion, employ­ment and train­ing, eco­nomic devel­op­ment, hous­ing, health and social wel­fare. These pro­grams are designed to strengthen the growth and devel­op­ment of indi­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies in the Wash­ing­ton Heights Area. 
The orga­ni­za­tion was formed by com­mu­nity res­i­dents who were con­cerned with the pro­vi­sion of com­pre­hen­sive ser­vices to lower-income fam­i­lies with preschool chil­dren, and fol­low­ing them through the early years of ele­men­tary school. The eth­nic make-up of the Ft. George Com­mu­nity Enrich­ment Center’s pop­u­la­tion con­sists of His­panic, Black, Asian and Cau­casian fam­i­lies. The com­po­si­tion of the Ft. George Com­mu­nity Enrich­ment Center’s Board of Direc­tors reflects this mul­ti­cul­tural com­mu­nity with the major­ity of its mem­bers resid­ing within this area. In line with this, the Wash­ing­ton Heights area is an evolv­ing com­mu­nity of growth. The area is tran­si­tional in the sense that there is a rel­a­tively high in-and-out migra­tion.

George Com­mu­nity Enrich­ment Cen­ter, Inc. was founded and incor­po­rated in 1981 for the pur­pose of estab­lish­ing, main­tain­ing, and oper­at­ing pro­grams in edu­ca­tion, employ­ment and train­ing, eco­nomic devel­op­ment, hous­ing, health and social wel­fare. These pro­grams are designed to strengthen the growth and devel­op­ment of indi­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies in the Wash­ing­ton Heights Area. 
The orga­ni­za­tion was formed by com­mu­nity res­i­dents who were con­cerned with the pro­vi­sion of com­pre­hen­sive ser­vices to lower-income fam­i­lies with preschool chil­dren, and fol­low­ing them through the early years of ele­men­tary school. The eth­nic make-up of the Ft. George Com­mu­nity Enrich­ment Center’s pop­u­la­tion con­sists of His­panic, Black, Asian and Cau­casian fam­i­lies. The com­po­si­tion of the Ft. George Com­mu­nity Enrich­ment Center’s Board of Direc­tors reflects this mul­ti­cul­tural com­mu­nity with the major­ity of its mem­bers resid­ing within this area. In line with this, the Wash­ing­ton Heights area is an evolv­ing com­mu­nity of growth. The area is tran­si­tional in the sense that there is a rel­a­tively high in-and-out migra­tion. Many young fam­i­lies in need of var­i­ous types of social and health ser­vices com­prise this neighborhood.

While offering an excellent education and invaluable services to deserving children, we strive to communicate the needs of these children to the general public, train professionals for work in the area of developmental disabilities, develop new programs and facilities and encourage positive public policies that benefit young children with disabilities.

I feel very connected to the “Little Missionary,” who founded the school at the turn of the century. Because I, too, have a mission to help children and families. My mission is to teach children to understand their feelings and the feelings of others, and to help parents to value the healthy expression of emotions in the family.

The most important factor in a child’s life – the thing that either makes a child a happy successful individual, or a frustrated unfulfilled person – is the state of his emotional health. Our goal at Little Mish is to create a space where children can learn to manage conflicts and express negative feelings in positive ways. In this healthy environment children can be creative, constructive, and collaborative.

We are also building community at our school. Parents need support, and we provide parent workshops and other opportunities for like-minded people to come together in a positive and nurturing environment.

As a female, Dr. Montessori was not permitted to practice medicine in Italy's hospitals so she opened the very first casa de bambini or ""children's house"" in a poor quarter of the San Lorenzo tenements.

The Montessori Method, based on careful observation of and respect for the natural development of the child, has become widely practiced in schools around the world for almost a century. Dr. Montessori recognized that a child is more responsive to certain learning experiences at particular times or ""sensitive periods."" Careful observation allows the Montessori-trained teacher to identify these sensitive periods when a child is ready for a new learning experience. The teacher then can direct the child toward materials that will satisfy his/her development needs. ""It is true we cannot make a genius,"" Dr. Montessori wrote.

During this time, children form their personality and self. Mind, memory, power to understand, and ability to think through impressions gained from the environment are all constructed during this time.
 
In addition to absorbing the surroundings through the five senses, primary-aged children are more responsive to certain learning experiences at particular times. Dr. Maria Montessori identified these times as Sensitive Periods, after which the opportunity for maximizing development is lost. During these Sensitive Periods learning is most thorough, concentration most intense, and enthusiasm is at its richest. Children pursue, with endless repetition, activities which are of interest to them. Dr. Montessori identified Sensitive Periods for language acquisition, order, detail, sensorial exploration, writing, words, numbers, manners and courtesy, and precise movement. The Primary Montessori classroom is designed to meet the individual needs of each child. By the time children have reached pre-school age, their actions have become purposeful and willful, and their focus turns to their peers and the new community of which they are now a member.

Sixth Avenue was still famous for its shopping, and New York’s great department stores such as Lord & Taylor’s and B. Altman’s employed many of the young women of Chelsea.  On the west side of Chelsea, the meat-packing district and the Chelsea docks and ferries were in full swing.

We are a conservative, egalitarian synagogue, founded by survivors and refugees from Germany. The Nursery School was founded in 1997 to ensure the continuation of the synagogue and to keep the memories on which it was built alive. Just as “Habonim” means “builders,” the Nursery School has played a major role in building the next generation at Habonim. In our comparatively short history, the Nursery School has seen tremendous growth as over the years more and more parents have enrolled their children in our school and have entrusted us with the care and development of their children.  Very simply put, our School’s philosophy focuses on the individual child. Nursery School-aged children develop at very different rates and in different ways within a small age span. They have different interests, different natural abilities and areas that need encouragement and support, and it is our goal to find effective ways to nurture them in all of the ways that matter across all developmental areas: cognitive, language, physical, and social and emotional. We want the children in our school to become relaxed learners who are willing to take risks and try new things. We want our children to become noticers of the world around them. We want children to make connections that are the building blocks for a lifetime of curiosity and growth. From the moment that children begin school at Habonim, they begin the process of learning through an integrated, hands-on curriculum that is rich, creative and fun!";"http://habonim.net/Early-Childhood";"https://www.facebook.com/CongregationHabonim";;;"http://habonim.net/Admissions";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://habonim.net/sites/default/files/uploaded_images/site/Education/Early_Childhood/nursery%20school%20logo.jpg";"http://habonim.net/sites/default/files/uploaded_images/site/Education/Early_Childhood/IMG_2705%20-%20Version%202.jpg";"http://habonim.net/sites/default/files/uploaded_images/site/Education/Early_Childhood/aIMG_7192.jpg";"http://habonim.net/sites/default/files/uploaded_images/site/Education/Early_Childhood/nov2011%20032.JPG";"http://habonim.net/sites/default/files/uploaded_images/site/Education/Early_Childhood/IMG_0138%20-%20Version%202.jpg";;

When very young children enter school they are still in the process of forming themselves as individuals. Once they become secure individuals they can then become part of a group.  Play is actually the work of childhood and it is through play that children develop themselves and then learn to get along with others.

Our goal is to provide for each child a springboard from which they can be successfully launched on an educational career beyond preschool. Our students acquire both academic knowledge and social skills. The youngest children enter still constructing themselves as young individuals and by the time they enter kindergarten elsewhere, they have mastered the necessary skills to be engaged cooperative members of a group. Children learn to take turns, share and collaborate with respect for other people and the surroundings. Education here is an active, child-centered enterprise, led by a dedicated, talented faculty. The children are given time to explore and interact. They are also given the freedom to develop their own interests.  Our students are known and recognized for their kind and cooperative behavior. This occurs as a direct result of the fact that we emphasize respect and cooperation by creating an environment in which the children feel safe, comfortable and valued, while being engaged and interested in their activities. In a warm, supportive and challenging classroom children take pride in their own accomplishments and appreciate the accomplishments of others. The daily programs are designed to meet the specific developmental needs of every child.

Scheduled activities include, group meetings, theme- based projects, music, art, fine motor and gross motor activities. There is also ample time each day for individual and small group exploration of many inherently interesting activities in the room. These experiences which are developed around the child’s choice of activity, with an emphasis on free play, are critical for the development of language skills and mathematical thinking that result from our skilled teachers guiding the flow and direction of the child’s chosen work. In a flexible responsive classroom the teachers respond to the specific interests of the children. The differences between a play based model and other models is not what information and skills are gained but rather the ways in which skills and knowledge are offered to the children. We want to put the ‘pre’ back into preschool and feel that early education is not merely a smaller version of later education with workbooks, drills and computer technology, but rather a preparation for later education. Happiness, creativity and active imaginations are all much more important for later academic success than early acquisition of automated information.";"http://pamdayschool.org/";;"Monday - Friday, 8:30am-3pm";;"http://pamdayschool.org/programs/applicationsadmissions/";"http://pamdayschool.org/current-parents/parent-handbook/";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://pamdayschool.org/wp-content/themes/pamds/img/sun.png";"http://pamdayschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/slide10.jpg";"http://pamdayschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Slide8.jpg";"http://pamdayschool.org.s172556.gridserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/youner-3-new-crop.jpg";"http://pamdayschool.org.s172556.gridserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Older-4s5s-300x281.jpg";;

At Peartree we plant the seeds for early learning. Our goal is to provide a place where children learn the wonders of the world and teachers prepare the next generation for future success. We focus on the individual child and how s/he lives within a group, and believe in strong connections with each child’s family.

This school was built with a lot of love. Both of my children will be attending Peartree, so it was important to create a place where both they and the families in our neighborhood feel comfortable. As a professional, I’ve recruited the best teachers to educate our children and prepare them for future success. As a mother, I have made sure the facility and staff provide the comfort and security young children need.

We know that children’s brains are elastic and our goal is to stretch their minds and inspire them through tangible experiences and concrete learning. Piaget once stated, “Knowledge is not given to a passive observer; rather it must be constructed by the activity of the individual.” Accordingly, our curriculum is based largely on students’ interests and curiosities.

Our children learn science, math, social studies, literacy, the arts, Judaic studies, and moral values through an integrated approach to education. Our goal is to nurture each child’s personal journey towards social, emotional, and educational growth.

Therefore, our curriculum offers differentiated motivational stimuli to enhance individual growth and progress, while students engage in collaborative activities. This gives us the ability to inspire them to become lifelong learners with an insatiable quest for knowledge and understanding of their world.

We enthusiastically embrace one of the most important tenets of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education – that the environment is the third teacher. Children thrive and develop most optimally in a beautiful, natural environment that reflects their interests and work while also reflecting the ambience of home.

We know that children’s brains are elastic and our goal is to stretch their minds and inspire them through tangible experiences and concrete learning. Piaget once stated, “Knowledge is not given to a passive observer; rather it must be constructed by the activity of the individual.” Accordingly, our curriculum is based largely on students’ interests and curiosities.

Our children learn science, math, social studies, literacy, the arts, Judaic studies, and moral values through an integrated approach to education. Our goal is to nurture each child’s personal journey towards social, emotional, and educational growth.

Therefore, our curriculum offers differentiated motivational stimuli to enhance individual growth and progress, while students engage in collaborative activities. This gives us the ability to inspire them to become lifelong learners with an insatiable quest for knowledge and understanding of their world.

We enthusiastically embrace one of the most important tenets of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education – that the environment is the third teacher. Children thrive and develop most optimally in a beautiful, natural environment that reflects their interests and work while also reflecting the ambience of home. The colors, furniture, trees, flowers, objects d’art and natural elements of our NYC preschool all contribute to the preservation of the sense of wonder, curiosity, and zeal for life innate to all children.

Our goal is to help create and support happy, secure families. Our mission is to support the parent as the child’s primary teacher.
 
Renaissance Village is a member of American Montessori Society and licensed by New York City Department of Health.
 
The founder of Renaissance is Dr. Tatjana Matano, fourth generation educator originally from Eastern Europe. Tatjana has over twenty years of experience in education as University teacher, trainer in whole brain and accelerated learning for adults and as an early childhood educator. In 2001, after the birth of her second child, she started a special, enriched Nursery program in Hudson Heights in Manhattan which evolved into a Montessori center by 2007. As a mother of two children she herself knows the struggles of parenting and the importance of choosing the right educational environment during early years.
 
Tatjana has assembled a team of devoted teachers and assistants who share her own dedication to the early childhood as the most important period for the fulfillment of one’s potential and who also share her dedication to parenting community as a whole. The Education Director and Head Teacher of Renaissance Village is Ms. Jean Caswell, a veteran of Montessori teaching with over 35 yrs of experience. Ms. Olga Schmukler is her partner, an early childhood educator with outstanding talents in the areas of Music and Art and with over 20 yrs of experience in the classroom. She combines Russian Music pedagogy with Montessori principles . Our program has two more teachers and two assistants who make sure the Montessori philosophy of respect and trust in the child is present throughout the day and beyond the class time.
 
Dr. Matano and Ms. Caswell are dedicated to continuous and thorough training of the entire staff in the principles of Montessori work. They also offer parenting workshops and have developed a nine month program (sept-june) for families entitled “The Joyful Family” which elaborates on all the aspects of family life through the lens of Montessori approach. In addition, the Assistants are trained in Health and Safety, CPR, First Aid, Control of Infectious Disease, Child Abuse Prevention and Food Protection.";"http://www.renvillage.com/contact.html";;"Monday-Friday 8:00 am-6:00 pm.

We accommodate each child in the Play Group as totally unique in his emotional needs, group adaptation capabilities, and skills readiness. Rudimentary socialization skills are an important emphasis in our program, but not at the expense of the child’s sense of self or overall happiness. Individual differences and “stages” are quickly perceived and respected. Our program and facilities provide a rich environment for learning and growth. A wide variety of activities and materials encourage the child’s emotional, intellectual, social and physical development.

An Exceptional Early Childhood Center
    As a matter of convenience for working parents, we are open from 7:30a.m. to 6:30p.m., Monday through Friday.
    Our age-specific curriculum is designed to stimulate and cultivate the student’s intellect in a fun way that makes them want to come in every day.
    We believe that a healthy mind can’t be attained without a healthy body, so we provide a nutritious breakfast, lunch and snack every day.
    Sunshine pre-school programs have been servicing diverse families and communities in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx since 2004. Our universal goal is to offer affordable family solutions for parents while inspiring a passion for knowledge in children at a young age.
    We are proud of our affordable, top-quality Pre-K programs, so as a means to extend our services to a broad range of financial abilities, we accept all New York City vouchers issued by HRA and ACD.

Sunshine’s Philosophy
    We are an Early Childhood center that serves not as a mere daycare center, but as a place where your child can begin to build the foundation for a life of educational pursuits.
    We treat every activity as a chance for your child to learn and grow. No activity is without an enriching purpose behind it.
    We feel that by keeping your children intellectually and socially stimulated, they will hit the ground running while attending school in their later years.
    Communication between our parents, children and faculty is extremely important to us, so we have an “open door policy” to ensure every question, concern, or issue is addressed.

The educational goal of The William Woodward Jr. Nursery School is to provide a setting in which children are nurtured in all areas of development - social, emotional, intellectual and physical.

Children are active learners and learn from their experiences. From the moment of birth, they are experiencing and discovering the world through their senses. In cheerful, child centered classrooms, children are encouraged to learn by exploring, trying, and doing. Teachers trained in early childhood education act as facilitators, guiding children to learn through play. At Woodward, we help prepare children both for the academics and for life, by fostering in them a healthy ego and sense of self, an inner discipline, respect, and empathy for others, gradually increasing independence, and an awareness that they are an important part of the community.

Our school community is national and international and we work together to understand and appreciate our unique differences. The staff is skilled in developing communication between native English-speaking children, and children whose primary language is other than English. The diversity of families at Woodward enriches us all.

This play will promote the social, emotional, physical and cognitive development of every child involved and will be done in an inclusive setting that promotes multicultural, non-sexist and non-stereotypical experiences, nutrition, personal hygiene and safety.

We encourage, respect and acknowledge the fact that every child is an individual that learns at his/her own pace and in his/her own way. We give these children love and attention and the opportunity to make choices according to their own individual preferences and curiosities. Our philosophy and practices adapt according to changes in the educational process and the children’s needs. We take pride in what we do, for example:

P = Providing guidance to children in getting along with one another, learning together and providing new and challenging learning experiences.

R = Remembering to keep the program flexible and provide a lot of positive reinforcement.

I = Interacting with children, parents and the community in order to foster mutual respect.

D = Demonstrating respect for cultural and ethnic diversity and modeling positive behaviors.

We believe in a Whole Language Approach; we surround the children with language. This type of program helps the children to develop a lifelong love and appreciation for literature as well as an early understanding of language structure. Through a variety of activities based on the alphabet, even our youngest children learn to recognize letters and their corresponding sounds. They develop skills in listening, speaking, observing, thinking and ultimately reading and writing. Science, math and social studies are integrated within the reading program, as well as creative art, music, dramatic play and a variety of gross motor activities.

In addition, our center integrates other methodologies that allow children to develop “multiple intelligence” We seamlessly incorporate the guidelines of CDA certification standards, Universal Pre Kindergarten programs, Head Start programs, NAEYC, and Board of Education guidelines.";"http://bumblebeesrus.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/BumblebeesRUs";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://bumblebeesrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/logo-1.png";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/s720x720/10325165_627693657306202_4231964085981670002_n.png";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/p180x540/10268664_628095543932680_5144076245848891670_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/q71/s720x720/10153741_620684864673748_6777744252864835367_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/p480x480/1606925_603311603077741_311249007_n.jpg";;

When provided with opportunities to initiate play, in an environment in which he feels valued, loved, respected, and accepted, the child is able to learn and master new skills, and to develop those characteristics which will enable him to meet life’s challenges: self-esteem, confidence, self-discipline, the belief that he can have an effect on his world, a love of learning, intellectual curiosity, creativity, empathy, a respect for the rights of others, an acceptance of those who are different from himself";"http://highhopeschildcare.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/HighHopesChildCare";"6:30am - 6:30pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://highhopeschildcare.com/wp-content/themes/germaniumify/images/site-name.png";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t1.0-9/10414546_870486992968278_6669644657063714013_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/q71/s720x720/10387332_870486959634948_319053677004439616_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1.0-9/p180x540/1489254_756833587666953_1760450696_n.jpg";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t1.0-9/p180x540/1459069_756833357666976_886573010_n.jpg";;

The program cares for the child as a whole so that there is also emphasis placed on nurturing emotional growth, while sparking excitement and enthusiasm in learning endeavors.

Children work in small groups based upon their abilities rather than arbitrary chronological grouping rules. This ensures each child being able to work at his own pace and reach his own potential through opportunities for critical thinking and problem solving. Small grouping by ability allows us to respond to individual needs.

At Oakdale Academy we believe that each child is entitled to reach his or her full potential both as an academic learner as well as a well-rounded individual. We carefully attend to the academic development while nurturing the emotional growth and self-esteem of the child. Our goals include:

    Successful transition from home to school
    Development of self-esteem
    Development of respect for others and the environment
    Development of self-confidence
    Appreciation and love of learning
    Positive feelings towards school
    Critical thinking skills

We strive to provide a safe nurturing environment, filled with open-ended age appropriate materials for exploration and discovery. Our hope is to offer challenging thematic curriculum with a commitment to the education of the whole child. Education is a social process. Teachers and children are expected to experiment collaboratively to form conclusions. We strive to create an environment, which will bring out the innate passion for learning that is in each child. We provide purposeful experiences that create cooperation, care, respect, exploration and participation. We believe that every child is different and learns at his or her own pace. Children learn by doing. Hands-on experiences are well remembered.

In 1982, Cambria Center for the Gifted Child moved into its own building and expanded to include not only pre-school but also elementary school. As the word spread, the student population grew and have continued to succeed based upon our theories concerning education.

The Center has grown to become a pre-eminent private non-sectarian educational institution with an annual enrollment of nearly 300 students from pre-k through 5th grade. A great number of our graduates leave our institution and enter preparatory schools on academic scholarships, while others enter some of the more challenging public schools and are raised a grade level based upon their academic strengths.

We are very proud of our program and look forward to having your family become part of our pre-school family.
The Diki Discovery Center is a place where Toddlers and preschoolers engage in discovery of the properties of materials and items in their environment. No one can paint a picture of a house before discovering that paint is wet, that it drips, and that it can be spread with fingers and other tools. They need repeated experiences before they are able to use materials symbolically. For example, one cannot build a train with blocks without an understanding that blocks are hard, solid, can be stacked or might fall over if they are not held steady, At Diki Discovery Center; children have many opportunities to pursue in‐depth investigations of materials around them. Our values reflect our belief that children learn best in a rich environment that focuses on the interweaving of cognitive and creative ways of thinking and learning. Our staff is truly committed to working in partnership with you and your child to provide for the highest quality early childhood experience.
I look forward to getting to know both you and your child and sharing a rewarding preschool experience.";"http://www.dikidiscovery.com/learn-more.html";;;;"http://www.dikidaycare.com/upload/pages/Application_Form.pdf";;"n";"y";"n";"n";"n";"n";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/1b8f2e8e5e5985e6f37a2ad4c4bcd224?AccessKeyId=38E6C667171412C38C62&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/41e38b59fd3ea70bd2c24a299548a342?AccessKeyId=38E6C667171412C38C62&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/23d252999820205b676a01f18f1d7c50?AccessKeyId=38E6C667171412C38C62&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/50818f337d589983e0cf1d9c1caac16a?AccessKeyId=38E6C667171412C38C62&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/afada38b00fe126346e15dd11b6e8b51?AccessKeyId=38E6C667171412C38C62&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";;

Active learning is the cornerstone to our educational approach. The children participate in exploratory activities that use all their senses; touching, smelling, tasting, seeing and hearing. Using their five senses, the children actively explore and experience their world in a fun and sometimes messy way.

Children are also exposed to pre-reading activities on a daily basis. The presence of visually supportive materials encourages early literacy.

Equally important as active learning is the development of interpersonal skills that will help ensure smooth and productive in the years of learning that lie ahead.";"http://www.fhjc.org/education/nursery-school-and-kindergarten/";"https://www.facebook.com/FHJCNursery";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";"http://www.fhjc.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fhjc-header-new.gif";;;;;;

HoneyPot of Flushing was created with certain goals in mind.  We believe that a combination of Eastern and Western philosophies of education will highly benefit all children and produce the most well rounded students.

To achieve our goals, we start by making sure that every child is and feels safe, comfortable and happy in their environment.  If a child’s needs are not met, or they are not happy to be a part of our HoneyPot community, learning will not take place.  The child must be well cared for, respected, and guided into positive learning experiences.

Once the child’s needs are met and they have developed a positive self-image, we use a combination of instructional methods and cooperative learning to build the foundation of your child’s education.  Their education begins with patience.  Patience is a skill that is taught and continuously worked on.  It is a crucial element in becoming a lifelong learner.

The teachers also work on community building.  Teaching children how to share, take turns and care for one another.  We want our children to be aware of their surroundings and to express themselves freely.

During lessons, children are taught to concentrate and to not disturb the class without raising their hands first and waiting to be called on.  They are taught persistence and encouraged not to give up. However, care is taken to ensure that the child is not to pushed past their frustration point.  To ensure this, developmentally appropriate activities and lessons are tailored to each age group and can then be modified to accommodate each child as an individual learner.

Ultimately, we want to produce students that are happy, healthy, academically prepared, patient, emotionally and socially confident and ready for kindergarten!";"http://www.honeypotdcc.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/HoneyPot-DayCare-Center/237840722922393";"8:00 AM – 6:30 PM";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";"http://www.honeypotdcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HPDCC-Logo2-300x134.png";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/p180x540/1545995_715331495173311_1322506312_n.jpg";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/q74/s720x720/10537353_767961806576946_586621269280214196_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/q75/s720x720/65961_767961463243647_986310892314483814_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/p180x540/10251890_733635810009546_7723471823735166689_n.jpg";;

We believe that play is a child's work. We provide a safe and nurturing environment for children to engage on a social, emotional, physical and cognitive level. Children learn to separate from their parents through a gentle process of adjustment, and come to love the routines, risks, excitement, challenges,and independence of school.

We are excited to be a part of the Universal Pre-K program which is provided free of charge by the Department of Education. Our classrooms are open and playful environments, led by phenomenal teachers, where children move freely to interact with each other. We believe children learn best through a combination of play and teacher-directed activities, and we help children to develop friendships as they learn.

It was founded in 1994 as a state certified nonpublic preschool for children with autism. In 1995, educational services were extended to school-age children between the ages of five and eleven. In 2002, NYCLI was certified to serve the needs of learners up to age 21. The institute implements a science-based educational approach and is committed to providing the highest standard of education for its students.

The educational services offered by the institute include center-based and in-home individualized behavioral intervention for children with autism. Autism is a pervasive developmental disability that is characterized by severe deficits in social and language development. With effective educational intervention, these children can learn critical language, social, and academic skills. As competencies in these skill areas develop, the children begin to build meaningful relationships with others and to live more productive lives.

The institute's educational model is based on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis, which has been demonstrated to produce effective outcomes for children with autism. The application of this science-based educational model is enhanced by the warmth and dedication of the professional teaching staff.

Although it is an independent, nonpublic institution, NYCLI's preschool and school are accredited and certified by the New York City Department of Health and the New York State Education Department.";"http://www.nycli.org/";;;"http://www.nycli.org/employment.html";;;"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";;"http://www.nycli.org/images/right/Pic6.jpg";"http://www.nycli.org/images/right/Pic7.jpg";"http://www.nycli.org/images/right/Pic8.jpg";"http://www.nycli.org/images/right/Pic9.jpg";;

It is a time of fun, warmth, security, exploration, and discovery. The school fosters self-esteem and builds confidence based on self-respect and respect for all others. We follow the “Golden Rule.” We have created a loving, trustful, and respectful environment which enables children to love, trust and respect their parents, teachers, each other, and especially themselves. We believe in the value of human diversity and the fair treatment of all people and the earth. Students and their families feel comfortable and welcomed at all times. We view the parents as partners in the education of their children and integrate them into our curriculum, as well as integrating into our community and becoming part of it.

Our staff is professional and knowledgeable about childhood development and early childhood education. We work collaboratively with our staff, parents, and the entire community to guide our students in their learning process. We have high expectations that are guided by the developmental needs of each child, with an understanding that many of our children have needs beyond that of learning essential skills; their needs are personal, pervasive, and affect them at every level of humanity. We follow standard pre-school curriculum guidelines and the New York State Common Core project. We focus on the whole child with developmentally appropriate quality education developed to meet the needs of each child. The Parsons Preschool maintains a progressive curriculum promoting learning the tools necessary to succeed in school and in life.

Pickwick School is the oldest and most respected nursery school in Queens and provides care for children from 6 months to 5 years old . It was founded in 1941 by Murray and Miriam Singer, and is nestled in a very quiet neighborhood in Briarwood, Queens. Pickwick School is currently owned by Chiarina and Patrick Nolan. Chiarina has been a part of Pickwick School for the past 27 years, both as an educator and owner. Our goal is, and always has been, to provide children with a safe and nurturing environment that gives each child the opportunity to grow socially, emotionally and intellectually.  We believe that children become active thinkers and creative explorers when given an opportunity to learn by doing. Our classrooms are designed to include different learning centers filled with hands-on activities and materials for the children to explore throughout the day.

Pickwick School also offers Universal Pre-Kindergarten, which is sponsored by the NYC Board of Education and provides children with a free 2 and 1/2 hour program that prepares children for Kindergarten and beyond.

Pleasant Learn~N~Play Center prepares children academically, emotionally and socially for elementary school. Additionally, we believe play is a vital element in a child's learning experience. It is a medium for self-expression and an excellent time to develop their individual thinking processes. 

A child takes in more information between the ages of one to six than they do the remainder of their life. We know these formative years are critical to the development of your child's creative talents, positive self-esteem and enthusiasm for learning. Pleasant Learn~N~Play Center provides a safe, nurturing environment for your child to grow and develop character.

Our Center and Programs are here for you and your child. Our schedules is established with a busy family lifestyle in mind.

Still, our original mission has remained the same:  to provide parents with a safe, loving and dependable place, where their children can discover the joy of learning and of community.";"http://www.rainbowchristian.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=7";;"7:30 am - 6:30 pm";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://www.rainbowchristian.com/images/stories/graphics/logo.png";"http://www.rainbowchristian.com/images/stories/photos/IMG_0115edited.jpg";"http://www.rainbowchristian.com/images/stories/photos/IMG_3202_edit.JPG";"http://www.rainbowchristian.com/images/stories/photos/programs.jpg";"http://www.rainbowchristian.com/images/stories/photos/front_door2.jpg";;

The growth and development of a child requires active and creative interactions with both teachers and peers in a positive child-centered learning environment. Children are nurtured in a SAFE, gentle, constructive, and caring atmosphere where their social, emotional, physical, and intellectual growths are encouraged. We support such an environment: where children will be able to build a foundation for a lifetime of learning and develop confidence, a healthy self-esteem, and sensitivity in a diverse world.

Parents are asked to be involved with their children--whether it be homework or birthday parties or school functions on or about holidays or issues relating to young children-- because we believe that there is a TRIANGLE OF LEARNING in which child and parent and school are each connected one to the other. The parent can reinforce what the child learns in school; the school can reinforce family practices that occur in the home. The young child is intimately connected and dependent upon his parents and the school; and we want his first formal school experience to be a positive one.
We have a strong belief that children are equipped with a natural curiosity for learning and desire to challenge themselves. We promote students to explore and discover their environment through play based and experiential learning. Children use educational tools and manipulatives to understand basic concepts and skills, while improving hand-eye coordination, memory and development of gross motor and fine motor skills.
We are committed to promoting children’s sense of competence, creativity and awareness of others.

**Emphasizes safety. Teachers choose only the activities that are appropriate for the children in their group, and supervision is a requirement.
**Provides consistency and a predictable routine, which is comforting to children. Children are relaxed and ready to learn when they can anticipate what is happening next. As children move through developmental milestones they need to practice skills at which they are successful. The variety of skill levels will vary greatly with any group of children, even those that are all the same chronological age. Activities may change or be repeated. We may spend fewer or more minutes on a specific activity; the daily/weekly routine is a guide.
**Includes open - ended activities and materials that build a learning community in the program. When materials can be used in a variety of ways, more children benefit. Activities that allow for multi-ages and multi-skill levels will include more children. Older, or children with advanced skills will be models for younger children or those who haven't yet attained the skill. Activities in this curriculum encourage children to work together, share, and be successful at their individual skill level.
**Encourages participation in two and three dimensional art, music, dramatic play, and creative movement. 
**Promotes multi-sensory experiences. Many opportunities are included in our activities that allow children to learn through touch, smell, taste, vision, and hearing. We know that children learn most when information is provided through all the senses.
**Invites exploration and discovery. The kits for fine motor and creative art include open - ended questions to promote thinking and problem solving. Our teachers model curiosity and wonder which helps children reach new levels of development and deeper understanding of concepts.";"http://www.kewgardenspreschool.com/";;"Monday -Thursday

We believe that given the opportunity, children can experience many different daily activities and situations to help them grow and build positive self esteem. By creating a warm and caring environment that fosters creative thinking, independence, and expression, children can build confidence in their learning ability and get ready to embrace learning as a tool for their lives.

Children have the ability to learn and absorb as much as possible throughout their lives however more learning occurs during a child's first five years than any other time in his or her life. We will work individually with each child by combining play with routine learning to help children develop their mind, body and spirit (inner self). Our goal is to bring out the educational best in your child while encouraging a life- long love of learning. 

In addition to serving as a trusted childcare provider, we view ourselves as a partner working closely with parents to enhance and expand your child's early learning experiences and promote healthy child development.";"http://www.sunflowerkidz.com/contact.html";;"Monday-Friday 7 am -6 pm";;"http://www.sunflowerkidz.com/pdf/Student%20enrollment%20form.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://sunflowerkidz.com/generator/assets/Classroom%20day.jpg";"http://www.sunflowerkidz.com/generator/assets/Jas%20and%20Jo.jpg";"http://www.sunflowerkidz.com/generator/assets/pizza%20day%202011.jpg";"http://www.sunflowerkidz.com/generator/assets/Outside%201.jpg";;

Our wish is to offer a safe and clean surrounding where every precaution is taken for the welfare and comfort of the children, as well as adults, therefore creating a comfortable setting every one can look forward to, every day.";"http://www.vipdaycarecenter.com/vip3/vipIIIcontactus.htm";;;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.vipdaycarecenter.com/images/horz_1.jpg";"http://www.vipdaycarecenter.com/images/horz_2.jpg";"http://www.vipdaycarecenter.com/images/horz_3.jpg";"http://www.vipdaycarecenter.com/images/horz_4.jpg";;

This free program uses appropriate developmental materials so that children become active thinkers and creative explorers rather than passive learners. Our large classroom is designed to nurture children’s intellectual development, self-esteem, independence, cooperation, and creativity.

By following the New York State Common Core Curriculum, we create a framework of learning that allows children to explore and problem solve, that builds upon their prior knowledge and interests, and that fosters their desire to be self-motivated in the pursuit of learning.

Our experienced and qualified staff carefully listen, observe, and document children’s work and growth. We conduct our program using the guidelines set by the New York City Department of

Education, the Department of Health, and the ECERS program.

Some of our annual events are two parent teacher conferences, costume parade, three age-appropriate educational trips, vision screening, picture day, moving-on day and parent participation day. We encourage all parents and caregivers to participate in these events and to volunteer in the classroom.

We follow the public school schedule for most of the year with a few variations. All parents will be notified on a monthly basis of any events or school closures.";"http://ywcaqueens.org/2013/04/upk-architects-project/";"https://www.facebook.com/ywcaqueens";;"http://ywcaqueens.org/get-involved/employment/";;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;"Tuesday"
