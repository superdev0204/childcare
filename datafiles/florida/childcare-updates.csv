H. Walter Fuller and his son Walter P. Fuller gained fame and fortune as they were the first to envision turning what was then 133 acres of jungle area into the recreational destination we now call Walter Fuller Park.

What they did not know, is that over the years a unique chemistry would evolve as thousands of residents would have an award winning range of recreational activities to enjoy 365 days a year, right in their own neighborhood.

Walter Fuller Park has four major service venues. First, the Park has playgrounds, picnic pavilions, baseball, soccer and football fields, tennis and basketball courts, a community pool and a lake with a surrounding nature trail. Secondly, the park is host to two major events - The Green Thumb Festival and the Susan Korman 3 Day Cancer Walk. Thirdly, the Walter Fuller Recreation Center provides recreational classes, elementary and teen programs and leagues, indoor basketball, volleyball and pickleball courts and community rental rooms. Finally, the Park's ability to host quality family events makes it unique. Dog Shows and dog parks, birthday parties, nature walks, High School Cross Country meets and community picnics are some just to name a few. Walter Fuller Park has truly become a complete recreational destination.

We also feel we can  make a difference in the lifes of children and we are respondsible for the ""whole"" child. Our curriculum includes experiences with real works of art and classical music. Wee The people uses a uniquely designed curriculum that is appproved by the Seminole County Early Learning Coalition. Creative curriculum provides a developmentally appropriate program that is challenging, stimulationg and meets the need of infants through school aged children.

Additionally, our school uses two other curriculums: Healthy Habits and Sparkle and Shine, which is a character development tool.  Interesting themes, combined with learning objectives called key experiences, help our teachers plan learning experiences in art, music, language, fine and gross motor, emergent math and literacy, movement and drama.  Our curriculum has a strong literature component. We believe that children become readers by being read to and that children become writers by having many opportunities to express their thoughts and feeling through print.

Creative curriculum is also based on the premise that children learn through active learning-direct interaction with materials and interaction with adults who facilitate children’s learning.  Manipulatives, puzzles, games and art materials stimulate “hands-on” learning and concrete learning experiences.  We also know that children do not learn skills in isolation.  Shapes, colors, numbers, letters and phonemic awareness are woven in throughout each and everyday to give children a strong foundation.  When we learn colors, we learn fuchsia and vermillion, children love different and interesting words.  When we learn shapes, we go past the circle and square and look for octagons, hexagons and pentagons within the school environment.  We are always looking for fun and interesting ways to stimulate children’s learning.

At Wee The People, we feel we can make a difference in the lives of children and their teachers, and that we are responsible for the “whole” child.  Our curriculum includes experiences with real works of art and classical music. A character building focus rounds out each monthly plan.  Our children are never too young to learn about honesty, patience or friendship. Brain power activates are also incorporated within the daily routine to help all our children make those brain building Connections. Activities that challenge and activities that strengthen are designed to individualize our program so that all our children can grow and develop at their own unique learning rates.";"https://weethepeople.shutterfly.com/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

She took her favorite quote to heart when it came to children (""be of love a little more careful than anything else.""e.e.cummings)
 
It is Wilma's Little People's School mission that each child has the right to have a developmentally appropriate education. We believe that young children should have a relaxed and nurturing environment that is developmentally structured to meet their needs. This should include carefully planned experiences in the following areas: Movement, Communication, Music, Art, Mathematics, The World Around Us, Health/Safety/Nutrition and Living in the World of People.
 
We provide developmentally appropriate pre-school classes for 2, 3, and 4 year olds.

Younger Years Learning Center was established in 1987, Younger Years has always been able to provide the children with an environment that is loving, safe and secure. As the owner my aim has always been to offer a center that even though is small, guarantees a high quality childcare program. This center ensures all the children know each member of staff; therefore, creating an environment that is stable and dependable. My staff works hand in hand with the children to build a helping and trustful relationship which lays the foundation for future formal learning.
 
Children thrive in an environment which feels safe and secure thereby ensuring success in learning and the development of positive self-esteem. As a result, a high percentage of our business is from repeat customers and referrals. I welcome the opportunity to earn your trust and provide an environment where each child can reach their own potential. Younger Years helps children create a brighter future.

We recognize this. So, we treat our school-agers to an additional space called the Blue Crew, named for their blue nametags.

Here they participate in more detailed art, age appropriate games, non-violent video games and can do homework. We even supply homework help at no extra charge. This is a special space like their room at home (maybe cleaner) where they can get away and just be or interact with peers.

During school breaks we create Blue Crew Camps with special themes. Watch for announcements. In many centers, kids can stay full-days when school is closed – check your local center’s back-up care program.

KidsPark is a family environment where kids of many ages play. Many of our Blue Crew kids have grown up with KidsPark; they know the routines and have a positive influence in the center as leaders and role models for younger children. No one has to worry about small toes being stepped on – we separate school-age and preschool children for gross motor games and times on the Mountain of Energy.

Even though school-agers want to act all grown-up, in truth, they still enjoy playing games, doing art, acting silly and being with other kids. And they can at KidsPark, as part of the Blue Crew.

KidsPark is here for your after school needs. Our teachers are happy to offer homework assistance for our Blue Crew kids!";"http://www.kidspark.com/center/Jacksonville/school-age/";"https://www.facebook.com/KidsparkJacksonville";"Mon - Thu: 7:30 am - 10:00 pm

The foundation of Christian education is the Word of God. The biblical principles of God s Word stand against the godless philosophies of humanism, materialism, and situational ethics (see Colossians 2:8).

Christian education is first and foremost the responsibility of the Christian home. City of Life Christian Academy seeks to assist parents in this process, not to act as a compensator for lack of Christian priorities in the home. Like parents and pastors, COLCA educators seek to nurture God s plan for each child and to equip each child academically so the child can fully realize the destiny God has planned for his/her life.

COLCA seeks to maintain an orderly campus, conducive to respect between faculty and students. Our administrators, faculty, and staff are all mature Christians who desire to teach and lead by example, as well as by instruction.

COLCA maintains that the most important lessons in physical education or in competition in academics or the arts are those of good sportsmanship, self- sacrifice, and a positive attitude.

The home and the church must contribute to student progress by establishing attitudes that encourage respect, integrity, and self-discipline. Ultimately, the successful Christian development of the student is dependent upon the student, the home, the church, and finally, the school.

When the COLCA administration believes that the home/school relationship is not in harmony with this stated philosophy and the terms of the Harmony Agreements are being violated, students may be refused enrollment in the school or may be required to leave the school without tuition refund and without release from the Financial Policies Agreement.";"http://www.colca.tv/#&panel1-2&panel2-1";;;;"https://secure.headmasteronline.com/hmolweb/newstudentinfo.aspx?site=143618";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://www.colca.tv/images/logo.png";"http://www.colca.tv/images/bg3a.jpg";"http://www.colca.tv/images/bg5a.jpg";"http://www.colca.tv/images/colca.jpg";;;

Our therapies (music, art, drama) provide the children an opportunity to increase self-expression, work as a group and better communicate feelings. Also,by introducing nutrition into the daily activity schedule, we have the opportunity to discuss with the children the importance of healthy eating habits and basic concepts of nutrition.

Students thrive spiritually here because we aim to strengthen those already with a foundational belief in God, while also explaining Biblical truths to those unsure of their faith. We accomplish this through chapel meetings and Bible instruction for every grade level. Through this variety of exposure, the believer will mature and learn to exercise their spiritual gift, while others will hear the message of Jesus Christ and His teachings.

 Academically, we provide an atmosphere where God-given talents are nurtured, excellence and self-discipline are cultivated, and future goals are set and realization. Our students are encouraged daily to work hard. They grow as they experience literature, writing, and the arts. The consistent incorporation of computers and technology in both the lab setting and individual classrooms continues to equip our students for the 21st century. We teach Bible, language arts, foreign language, life skills, history, science, and math in a systematic and comprehensive way that helps to prepare students for life in today's world. Our curricular program encourages the development of reasoning and cognitive skills that prepares students for success in post-secondary education.

Students grow socially at our school because we teach them that their spiritual growth is evidenced in their relationships, and in the respect they show for others. We work to equip them to deal biblically and confidently with the unbelieving world, therefore becoming articulate in expressing well-informed views on current social issues. Requirements for serving the community then prompt them to act on those views by embracing their roles as God-honoring members of society.

Physically, we want our students to understand that their bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit and that they are not their own. Therefore, they are to honor God with their bodies through sexual purity and biblically moral living. Also, we aim to foster a lifestyle that includes healthy eating, regular exercise, and the avoidance of harmful substances.

Our world is changing so fast! From one day to the next, technology is changing, science is changing, even our maps and geography are changing. Our students need to have the foundational principles to allow them to adapt knowledge to the world around them. Our goal is to prepare students to achieve success today and tomorrow.
There is another aspect of our future world for which Downey seeks to prepare its students. This world is not our home. We seek to prepare our students for the heavenly world where they will spend eternity. God’s Word provides the basis for all of our education.
Two excellent curricula are available at DCS. We have traditional classes which use the ABEKA curriculum. This is a setting similar to what you would find in a typical public school. The difference is, our class material is Christian in nature and philosophy and our teacher to student ratio in grades 3-12, is limited to 22 students per classroom. Early grades (Kindergarten through grade 2) are limited to 18 students per classroom. Currently we have a waiting list for several grades due to this policy.
In addition to ABEKA, our school offers ACE curriculum. The beauty of the ACE classroom is that the student can progress at the rate which is best for that particular child whether they are struggling to succeed or advanced and need greater challenges.";"http://www.dcsdmc.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/dcsdmc/info";"Mon - Fri: 7:00 am - 5:00 pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";;"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/p180x540/10488085_331978013618854_3712594979768091038_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/p180x540/10423807_331978220285500_7808541701525385738_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/p180x540/10440790_324699161013406_3294275404155764580_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/1376634_316962081787114_1448692934060406487_n.jpg";;

The first day of school is an exciting milestone in your child's life. Your child is embarking on a journey that will lead them on many roads of discovery and learning.  As wonderful as this new experience may be, it can also be quite stressful for the young child. New situations and change can, at times, be unsettling for all of us. For many children this may be their first experience of separation from parents or care givers at home. It is common for even the most outgoing child to be anxious the first day of school. We have provided a few suggestions for assisting your child during this time. Remember the preschool staff will be available to provide support and assistance; making your child's first school days happy days. Prepare your child for the new school experience by explaining what to expect. Answer all questions directly and honestly. Convey a positive attitude. Young children are aware of your feelings. Your enthusiasm will assure the child that school can be a fun and exciting place. Establish a routine involving both the night before a school day as well as morning preparation. Rituals and routines will add predictability and are comforting in unfamiliar situations. Bring something from home. This is acceptable and often reassuring in helping the child with the initial adjustment to school. This item may be a treasured blankie or even a photo from home. Clearly state to your child where you will be and when you will return. It may also be helpful to discuss what will happen when you are reunited. Maintain a clear good-bye routine. This may include warning the child you are leaving in 3 minutes, a kiss and hug, or a wave from the window. Once you tell your child you are leaving, it is important to follow through. Extending the good-bye with, ""Ok just one more kiss, and then I really have to go” tends to heighten anxiety rather than relieve it. Avoid sneaking out, as this seems to encourage children to become less trusting and makes the second day of school even harder.

Our program is built around the Bible in that it teaches us to “Grow in Grace and Knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ”, (2Peter 3:8) and “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it” (Proverbs 22:6).

We believe that each child who enters our program is a unique and special gift of God, and that it is our privilege and responsibility to help him be the very best that the Lord would have him be. We believe in the importance and authority of family and the church.

Spiritually:
We are committed to presenting the love of God and the understanding of His word, the Bible. We teach children that God loves and accepts each of them and that there is good and evil, and for them to make right choices. We want children to have a beginning understanding of worship, as well as participate in opportunities to worship Jesus as their Lord and Savior. We seek to teach scriptural principles within all activities.

Socially:
We believe that young children learn through well planned individual and group activities. Through guided learning centers, and structured circle times, our children learn to work and play together, respect each other and their property, and obey those in authority. Through participation, young children learn about their responsibility to God, family, friends, and community.

Intellectually:
The curriculum has been carefully chosen and evaluated to assist each child in attaining age appropriate skills and concepts. Activities are planned around curriculum themes, which integrate a variety of language arts, math readiness, science, art, music, and communication skills.

Physically:
Activities in the classroom and the playground provide opportunities to develop gross and fine motor skills. Throughout these activities, students gain skills that lead to success in school. Good health principles are taught and practiced. From clean rooms, clean hands, to teaching good hygiene, the children are learning to develop healthy habits.

We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Genesis 1:1, Matthew 28:19, John 10:30). We believe in the deity of Christ (John 10:33), His virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14, Matthew 1:23, Luke 1:35), His sinless life (Hebrews 4:15, 7:26), His miracles (John 2:11), His vicarious and atoning death (1 Corinthians 15:3, Ephesians 1:7, Hebrews 2:9), His resurrection (John 11:25, 1 Corinthians 15:4), His ascension to the right hand of the Father (Mark 16:19), and His personal return in power and glory (Acts 1:11, Revelation 19:11). We believe in the absolute necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit for salvation because of the exceeding sinfulness of human nature, and that people are justified on the single ground of faith in the shed blood of Christ, and that only by God’s grace and through faith are we saved (John 3:16-21; John 5:24; Romans 3:23, 5:8, 9; Ephesians 2:8-10; Titus 3:5). We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation (John 5:28, 29). We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:12, 13; Galatians 3:26-28). We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life (Romans 8:13, 14; 1 Corinthians 3:16, 6:19, 20; Ephesians 4:30, 5:18).";"http://www.knightschristianacademy.org/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/449dc52d41618c34dea899844acf6db0?AccessKeyId=69AACF4929BD6CE44BBE&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/d9fdc6da1eb6ee17925c773da4f4c28d?AccessKeyId=69AACF4929BD6CE44BBE&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/5ac2e8f3c6728428ff0fa2dfe3dbe6ee?AccessKeyId=69AACF4929BD6CE44BBE&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/080109ec1e0070ab547bf44431d0ad81?AccessKeyId=69AACF4929BD6CE44BBE&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/8a415a0f8475169b7fe4b5d0963a566e?AccessKeyId=69AACF4929BD6CE44BBE&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";;

To develop or improve social competency and school readiness in children through quality, individualized, comprehensive, and culturally sensitive service delivery. Head Start works collaboratively with community partners to empower families to achieve positive outcomes.

MFCS administers the federally-funded Head Start program and the state-funded Voluntary Prekindergarten (VPK) program in Hernando, Sumter and Volusia Counties. This program serves 977 three- and four-year old children from low-income families, preparing them for kindergarten through developmentally appropriate curriculum, the provision of health, mental health, nutrition, and dental services. Social services are provided for families and parent involvement is the key to program success. Ten percent of enrollment opportunities are made available to children with disabilities.

There are a number of reasons why we have incorporated ACE as our curriculum of choice, but the primary reason is that it is truly one of the best curriculum’s available in the world today.

Individualized Education is the primary focus of ACE, giving each student the ability to work at their own pace. This method of education helps students to not become frustrated  with how fast or slow a class as a whole may or may not be moving. No unreasonable time lines are set for students to finish their work or studies. Each student has specific daily goals the teachers and students agree upon and work together to accomplish. No student is ever degraded or passed over, left behind or labeled by any particular agency’s set standard.

Every child learns differently; some topics are easier for students to excel in, others are not. ACE sees every building block of a student’s education as crucial to the overall success of the student. We at RMCA agree that when a thorough and solid foundation is laid, the sky truly is the limit for student.";"http://rmca.info/";;;;"http://rmca.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ENROLLMENT_PROCESS-14-151.pdf";"http://rmca.info/?page_id=12";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

We plan for all areas of a child’s development: cognitive, emotional, social, creative, and physical. Individuality is acknowledged and respected as each child explores a child-centered environment at his or her own pace.

A strong sense of identity and competence are developed as children are helped to feel good about themselves, their abilities and uniqueness.

The Center recognizes the need for working closely with families to achieve these goals.

We believe that young children learn best through play and exploration of a variety of materials and activities in a safe and healthy environment. This is facilitated by the teacher, who structures the classroom environment and schedule of activities to meet the needs of each child in an age appropriate and stimulating environment.

Children develop and learn in the context of their families and the community. We create a stimulating, accepting and nurturing environment by establishing collaborative relationships with families. These emphasize mutual respect, cooperation, frequent two way communication and shared decision making roles in the program.";"http://www.thelittlehousenextdoor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=88&Itemid=116";;"6:30 am - 6:00 pm";;"http://www.thelittlehousenextdoor.com/enrollment.pdf";"http://www.thelittlehousenextdoor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=89&Itemid=108";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.thelittlehousenextdoor.com/images/stories/left2.jpg";"http://www.thelittlehousenextdoor.com/images/stories/pic1.jpg";"http://www.thelittlehousenextdoor.com/images/stories/113_0023.jpg";;;;

Our team of caring certified teachers and staff are dedicated in creating a fun and safe learning environment to help your child excel in their growth and development skills.

We run a safe and efficient school in a pleasant and happy setting to assure your child’s physical and emotional happiness at all times.

We understand that our children learn through play and that each child developes at their own pace. Our cirriculum follows the philosophy of Jean Piaget and Lev Vgotsky, where children pass through stages and the environment is an important factor in their development.
Our goal is to provide a program that meets the needs of young children in settings that individual creative expression is encouraged and respected. We emphasize and acknowledge the entire ""learning process"" rather than the finished product.

The children have the opportunity to participate in a broad range of age-appropriate activities. The classroom is divided into hands-on learning centers that encourage experimentation, exploration, and discovery in a secure, safe environment. Language skills are supported through conversation, text and pictures, games, music, and art. Participation in storytelling and reading activities will develop essential pre-reading skills and set the children on the path to literacy. Math and science skills are advanced through the use of sensory tables, blocks and other manipulatives. As the children come to understand basic math and science concepts, they will develop new interests and skills that will help them as they move on to kindergarten and beyond.";"http://www.lilwizardsacademy.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/lilwizardsacademy/info";"Mon - Fri: 6:30 am - 6:00 pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/q88/p180x540/10537762_704487779586280_8030288236473070689_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10540550_703975489637509_2268753709176303924_n.jpg?oh=c60973e61568461394a5859bbe531d3c&oe=545D9D05&__gda__=1417668699_63cb5dd79b8f03fc794af29de6713357";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10488255_703235573044834_8124698699099920911_n.jpg?oh=cd2a4c414f59ade3d69c162c66e2e2db&oe=54666D26&__gda__=1415309504_7072a96e0277cd658713276cf245775e";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10295670_691855370849521_5592240546807334084_n.jpg";;

She then began her own daycare in home.   After three years, Kristi and her mom, Linda Nickerson began discussing the possibilities of expanding the business in the area.  In 2001, Kristi and Linda decided to take a leap of faith and by the grace of God - began Building Blocks Academy.  With family values being a priority, they decided to bring in Linda's youngest daughter, Tiffany Phillips.  At that time, Building Blocks Academy was located on Westward in La Marque with a capacity of 33.  The ladies soon found out that they were growing quicker than they imagined.  A new facility was built and opened in January, 2005 on Main Street.  
This year we are celebrating 12 years and we are so thankful for all of the children in our care.  Not only do we have an impact on their lives, but they impact ours!

Whether the child is a baby or preschool age, the environment has a tremendous impact on the child, so our efforts are dedicated to creating an environment where those first years can be a positive and beneficial experience; and a program that will meet their developmental needs to set them for bright future.

We believe that children experience the greatest growth when they feel secure and wanted. Therefore, we will provide a warm, caring, comfortable and safe environment for our children.

Our philosophy is to encourage imagination and self-expression. Our teachers are trained to encourage children to use critical thinking and problem solving skills in their daily experiences. The classroom environment is carefully designed to reflect the children's interests and to cultivate positive self-image, independence, and interdependence. We foster equal opportunity in learning and education for all children regardless of race, creed, sex, religion, national origin, or physical condition.

We strive to enhance social, emotional, physical and intellectual growth in young children. Our program fosters curiosity, creativity and self-esteem by taking into account children's abilities and interests.

This is done through a comprehensive skill development process in the areas of literacy/reading, math, physical fitness, nutrition and daily living activities to children in Broward County.

Our therapies (music, art, drama) provide the children an opportunity to increase self-expression, work as a group and better communicate feelings. Also,by introducing nutrition into the daily activity schedule, we have the opportunity to discuss with the children the importance of healthy eating habits and basic concepts of nutrition. Our regularly scheduled field trips give the children an opportunity to experience things they might otherwise miss, while also realizing that learning is fun!

Ultimately, our goal is to create an afterschool/out of school/summer safe, structured environment in which children have fun, make friends, learn social literacy, math, science and daily living skills.";"http://ucpsouthflorida.org/our-programs";;;"http://ucpsouthflorida.org/employment";;;"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"http://ucpsouthflorida.org/uploads/media_items/ucp-of-south-florida-logo.325.163.s.png";;;;;;

We diligently pursue a phonics based and hands on curriculum. I believe that this is more rewarding and gratifying for children discovering new information and solving problems for themselves. To the students, a realm of new information is available for you to discover.

We are blessed to have a trained and dedicated faculty here to guide and encourage you. In the end, however; the learning accomplished is entirely up to you.

Our school is designed to help educate your child in a secure, intimate, colorful pristine setting. The school’s unique culturally rich educational environment celebrates differences and facilitates lively peer to peer interactions.

The low teacher to student ratio encourages personalized attention, active learning and tailored individual development. Our teachers are all experienced and have advanced degrees, certifications and trainings. Our lessons focus on the cognitive brain development, social, emotional and physical well being of the child. That is why we incorporate the five senses (seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and smelling) into our daily activities.

We have created an Academy with specialized rooms such as Art expression, manipulative and brain teasers, engineering and construction, science exploration, reading and literature, music and movement, dramatic play, gathering room (circle time) and an indoor safe, air-conditioned playground.";"http://www.bayharborislandpreschool.com/ora/preschool-contact-us";;"8:00 to

Learn more About Our Preschools to see how we bring our philosophy to life.

Loris Malaguzzi believed that “the wider the range of possibilities we offer children, the more intense will be their motivations and the richer their experiences. We must widen the range of topics and goals, the types of situations we offer and their degree of structure, the kinds and combinations of resources and materials, and the possible interactions with things, peers, and adults.”

Our KLA Schools are not just childcare learning centers, but environments where each child’s abilities, competences, and natural aptitudes, are nurtured in ways that develop new and inherent talents. Find out more about Our Programs to discover why our preschools have a lasting positive impact in children’s lives.

In December 1991, Newsweek magazine hailed the preschools of Reggio Emilia as the “best in the world.” The Reggio Emilia Approach and KLA Schools encourage children to acquire skills of critical thinking and collaboration.";"http://www.klaschoolscoconutcreek.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/klaschools";"Mon - Fri: 8:00 am - 6:00 pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.klaschoolscoconutcreek.com/images/logo_kla.gif";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t31.0-8/p526x296/10620070_10152606153176427_8864763560629668812_o.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t1.0-9/10561767_10152590826676427_2757657946800292720_n.jpg";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t31.0-8/p180x540/10446024_10152542777106427_6353081098989444034_o.jpg";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10414444_10152481909751427_6174714528104406301_n.jpg?oh=d2e964f2d4e4dcedcbb032c15809b7aa&oe=546F3E9D";;

For the past 12 years, we have faithfully instilled within our students both the knowledge and character needed for success in college and in life.

As you walk our campus, you will find a quiet, professional environment. Yet, within this structured setting, you will discover a family-oriented community of teachers and students, where mutual love and respect extend beyond the four walls of the classroom. It's not uncommon to see a teenager high-five a second-grader, and most elementary students know the names of our high school seniors.

Over the years, our school has also made a concerted effort to teach our students a Biblical worldview. Beyond their personal faith in God and His plan for salvation, there is also a real need to teach the next generation about God's plan for every area of life and society: government, finance, family, charity, etc. Through an innovative K-12 worldview program and a biblically-based academic currciulum, we are accomplishing this goal. And, after a year-long faculty inservice, we are even more equipped to further this effort in the future.

We would welcome the opportunity to show you our beautiful 5-acre campus. To schedule a visit, please give us a call. I hope that you will consider entrusting Faith Christian Academy with your child's education in the future.";"http://www.fcaflorida.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faith-Christian-Academy/194567073941328?sk=info";;;"http://www.fcaflorida.com/pages.asp?pageid=103728";"http://files.stablerack.com/WebFiles/75312/120911FCAHANDBOOK2013-2014.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";;"http://www.fcaflorida.com/apps/files/resize.asp?filename=M61A5528.jpg&width=676";"http://www.fcaflorida.com/apps/files/resize.asp?filename=DSC_0227.JPG&width=676";"http://www.fcaflorida.com/apps/files/resize.asp?filename=DSC_0227%282%29.jpg&width=676";"http://www.fcaflorida.com/apps/files/resize.asp?filename=DSC_0235%282%29.jpg&width=676";;

We wanted no shortcuts that would compromise any aspect of high-quality childcare; safety, a professional and highly trained staff that we can be proud of, an environment fulfilling to both parents and children, balanced educational programs, superb hygiene including bathroom and diaper procedures, immaculate housekeeping, an odor free environment, top notch hands-on creative lesson plans and attention to table manners.
We encourage you to involve yourself in our program by sharing any pertinent information, books, songs, videos, cultural and other materials that are relevant to our activities. We feel strongly that parent/teacher communication is vital to your child's growth and development. If you ever feel that your child needs additional assistance, or if you have any questions about our program, please let us know.
Over the years we have received many complimentary comments from the parents of the children entrusted to our care. You may find some of these parent comments of interest.
Each day when you leave your child at Bosman's Family Inc., we want you to be absolutely confident that he or she will be safe, happy and given the opportunity to explore and participate in a fulfilling day of educational, hands-on fun. Thanks for visiting us and we are looking forward to hearing from you.";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bosmans-Family-Inc/344802272255707?sk=info";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bosmans-Family-Inc/344802272255707?sk=info";;;;;"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";;;;;;;

Projected services will include an early intervention program, a preschool, an academic and social program for students ages 5-22, a vocational training program, all therapies associated with disabilities and rehabilitation, and an array of mental health services.";"http://progressivepediatric.org/";;;"http://progressivepediatric.org/page.php?id=29";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://progressivepediatric.org/img/logo-big.gif";"http://s311890973.onlinehome.us/uploads/image/TLC%20-%20Kids.jpg";"http://progressivepediatric.org/img/IMG_1351.jpg";"http://s311890973.onlinehome.us/uploads/image/PPTS0079.jpg";;;

This learning process is based upon developmental achievements, the child’s individual style of learning and experimental background. Each child is unique.
We believe that most of life’s learning, including how to learn, occurs in the first years of life. Children learn by active exploration, manipulation, and concrete experience. These aspects form the foundation for more abstract learning that allow the children to question, reason, create, and engage in meaningful interactions with others. The primary medium for young children’s learning is play. The nature and needs of the individual child is recognized. The child can attain meaning and mastery within the environment through social interactions with peers, the teacher and the other nurturing adults.

 Treehouse Preschool Academy was opened in August 2008 out of a desire to provide quality, affordable childcare that focused on meeting each child's individual and unique needs.

In the years since our doors opened, we have seen amazing growth and have been blessed to serve our community and its smallest members: our preschoolers.

We are a faith-based preschool that focuses on teaching children about the love of God through our actions, not just Bible stories. All beliefs are welcomed here.

We are now open and enrolling! We offer premier child care to children ages six weeks to five years and after school care for children up to eight years of age at most of our centers. The Learning Experience is not just a daycare facility but also a complete child development center with a dynamic and fun environment that is committed to quality care and education of your child.

Our parents have confidence each day that their child is being taken care of in a loving and respectful environment. We extend the offer to all families to come visit us and see why The Learning Experience in Lake Mary is the perfect home away from home. We know that choosing care for your little one(s) is an important decision and greatly affects the life of your child and your family. We pride ourselves on our warm and loving teachers, phenomenal curriculums and the simple extras that make bringing your child to day care an easy and stress free event.

Our unique programs are based upon years of research and early childhood education experience and that is why we pride ourselves on offering both excellent academic programming as well as a variety of enrichment programs all free of charge to our children. Our schools are divided into classrooms based on age and development beginning with our state-of-the-art infant rooms. From there, children advance into the Toddlers, Twaddlers, Preppers, Preschool, Pre-K and Kindergarten programs.

The Learning Experience® is extremely proud of our proprietary curriculum, ""L.E.A.P®"", or The Learning Experience's Academic Program. At TLE we realize that how children learn is as important as what they learn and encourage each child to achieve success while acquiring invaluable social skills. L.E.A.P. is broken into three separate stages based on age and development beginning with Little Learners and progressing through L.E.A.P.® 1 and L.E.A.P.® 2.

All children participate in one or more of our enrichment programs provided by Charlie Choo Choo® Enrichment Programs, whose certified instructors come directly to the childrens classrooms. Programs including Music 4 Me®, Dancing Feet®, Suddenly Science®, Marvelous Math®, Start to Art®,  Movin' & Grovin'® and Fun with Phonics® further develop each child's imagination, socialization skills, mind and body. The programs rotate every twelve weeks and the program(s) each class receives is determined upon age appropriateness. In addition, we believe what is good for one child is good for all and that is why we never charge our parents for enrichment programs. Come see our facilities in Lake Mary, where we invite you to join our TLE family!";"http://heathrow.tlechildcare.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/TLEChildCareCenters";"Mon - Fri: 6:30 am - 6:30 pm";"http://thelearningexperience.com/careers";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://heathrow.tlechildcare.com/images/header_logo.png";"http://heathrow.tlechildcare.com/images/infant-room3.jpg";"http://heathrow.tlechildcare.com/images/afterschool-room.jpg";"http://heathrow.tlechildcare.com/images/toddler-room.jpg";"http://heathrow.tlechildcare.com/images/preschooler-room.png";;

We are conveniently located at 16232 Bayberry Glen Dr. We offer premier child care to children ages six weeks to five years and after school care for children up to eight years of age at most of our centers. The Learning Experience is not just a daycare facility but also a complete child development center with a dynamic and fun environment that is committed to quality care and education of your child.

Our parents have confidence each day that their child is being taken care of in a loving and respectful environment. We extend the offer to all families to come visit us and see why The Learning Experience is the perfect home away from home. We know that choosing care for your little one(s) is an important decision and greatly affects the life of your child and your family. We pride ourselves on our warm and loving teachers, phenomenal curriculums and the simple extras that make bringing your child to day care an easy and stress free event.

Our unique programs are based upon years of research and early childhood education experience and that is why we pride ourselves on offering both excellent academic programming as well as a variety of enrichment programs all free of charge to our children. Our schools are divided into classrooms based on age and development beginning with our state-of-the-art infant rooms. From there, children advance into the Toddlers, Twaddlers, Preppers, Preschool, Pre-K and Kindergarten programs.

The Learning Experience® is extremely proud of our proprietary curriculum, ""L.E.A.P®"", or The Learning Experience's Academic Program. At TLE we realize that how children learn is as important as what they learn and encourage each child to achieve success while acquiring invaluable social skills. L.E.A.P. is broken into three separate stages based on age and development beginning with Little Learners and progressing through L.E.A.P.® 1 and L.E.A.P.® 2.

All children participate in one or more of our enrichment programs provided by Charlie Choo Choo® Enrichment Programs, whose certified instructors come directly to the childrens classrooms. Programs including Music 4 Me®, Dancing Feet®, Suddenly Science®, Marvelous Math®, Start to Art®,  Movin' & Grovin'® and Fun with Phonics® further develop each child's imagination, socialization skills, mind and body. The programs rotate every twelve weeks and the program(s) each class receives is determined upon age appropriateness. In addition, we believe what is good for one child is good for all and that is why we never charge our parents for enrichment programs.";"http://fishhawk.tlechildcare.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/TLEChildCareCenters";"Mon - Fri: 6:30 am - 6:30 pm";"http://thelearningexperience.com/careers";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://fishhawk.tlechildcare.com/images/header_logo.png";"http://fishhawk.tlechildcare.com/images/prepper-room2.png";"http://fishhawk.tlechildcare.com/images/preschooler-room.png";"http://fishhawk.tlechildcare.com/images/kindergarten-room.png";"http://fishhawk.tlechildcare.com/images/infant-room3.jpg";;

Banks kept banker's hours instead of customer's hours. The only walk-in clinics available to the sick were the hospital emergency rooms. There were no convenience stores where you could pick up some badly needed aspirins late at night, after all the drugstores had closed. There was nothing jiffy about getting an oil change - you made an appointment with the shop and left your car there all day.
    People just lived with the inconveniences of a ""9 to 5"" world.
     But businesses eventually saw an opportunity in extending their hours and services to accommodate the rapidly changing lifestyle of their customers. Grocery stores became 24/7. Malls started to open from morning till late night, all 7 days. Banks no longer kept banker's hours. However, one service business never changed - the child care business.
  
     Sensing a huge disconnect between what parents need and what preschools provide, the founders of Aunt D's, now a growing chain of preschools, innovated a bold, new concept in 2001. But there was nothing all that new about it. Aunt D's merely offered parents the level of service they had come to expect from all other businesses - late hours, open on weekends, and just as importantly, to be able to get quality child care anytime, without prior arrangement. Parents loved it!
    Aunt D's Child Care Centers offer education and care to your children on your terms! We understand you work late sometimes. Some of you are in health care or retail and routinely work nights and weekends, when all the traditional preschools are closed. And all of you, even the stay-at-home moms, need a reliable sitter when you need her, not when and if she is available.
    Open late hours, combined with child care anytime once you have registered! That's the Aunt D's solution for today's busy lifestyle. Doesn't it make perfect sense?
   You now have the freedom and luxury to work any schedule, do anything anytime, with the reassurance that your child can be placed in an enriching, educational and secure environment. The preschool of the 21st century has arrived!

We believe that positive choices empower our youth into leading productive lives. High School graduation is the expectation of the Study Center; a college education is the goal. WBSC is intended to fill those needs that are not being met through the home or school. The Study Center emphasizes academic development, counseling, nutritional needs, study skills, recreational activities, living skills, and citizenship in a multicultural society.
The Wayne Barton Study center came about when retired Boca Raton Police Officer Wayne Barton patrolled the Pearl City neighborhood in the 1980’s. He understood the challenges facing the area’s youth as he had grown up under very similar circumstances: poor, suffering from low self esteem, being told he would never amount to anything. To give the youth a “boost” he convinced the local housing authority to allow him to turn a 600 square foot apartment in Dixie Manor public housing project into a study center. The neighborhood youth were invited to use the center as a safe place to do their homework and escape an often- chaotic home environment that did not support learning.
Although the apartment was a good beginning, it was not large enough to accommodate all the youth who needed, and wanted, help. Wayne Barton envisioned a true study center designed to get the young people off the streets and guide them toward a successful future.

Our role as educators is to facilitate opportunities for children to express themselves using multiple forms of communication leading them to have more significant understanding of who they are as individuals, thinkers and as students.

aboutBottega Child Development Center is an innovative learning facility dedicated to practicing the highest standards of early childhood education. Our world is increasingly facing rapid changes that demand children to be prepared for this complex and competitive society. It is not enough for children to master the 3R’s, reading, writing, and arithmetic presently tested in today’s school. It is our belief that we must go above and beyond the basics and prepare our students for the 4C’s; communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity.

Bottega Child Development Center is a member of state and nationally recognized early childhood organizations, such as the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and the North American Reggio Emilia Alliance.";"http://bottegachild.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/BottegaChildDevelopmentCenter";"Mon - Fri: 7:30 pm - 6:00 pm";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/s720x720/10616335_807042369347170_3706976947200229784_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t1.0-9/s720x720/10568807_807043666013707_634210975833219685_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t1.0-9/p720x720/10426695_777310962320311_6176129104877102966_n.jpg";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/s720x720/10432975_777305435654197_4939448419150320101_n.jpg";;

The Reggio Emilia approach principles are based on:

    The child is protagonist, collaborator and communicator.
    The environment is a third teacher.
    The teacher is a researcher, partner and guide.
    Documentation is a valued way of communication.
    The parent’s participation as a partner.
    The many languages of children as a way to express their knowledge through representational work.

Our two-way bilingual program focuses on language development in two languages by exposing the students to music, learning center activities, circle time, reading, playing, and daily interactions in both languages. Our curriculum stimulates learning and curiosity in children. We foster a learning environment where the students can achieve and excel academically, socially, physically, and emotionally, through structured quality teaching, mentoring, and support by our faculty and staff. The students are encouraged to develop good moral character, morals, habits, and individual talents.

We pride ourselves in creating unique learning environments that cater to the families which we service. Our school prides itself in being an extension of the students’ home, a place where students are provided a safe learning environment. We also pride ourselves in offering the highest quality of educational child care/pre-school services available. It is important to us that the children cherish their school, that school be a familiar place, a home away from home, and that we be part of creating memories that will last a lifetime.

Our teachers and staff not only instruct and support the students academically, but they also nurture and guide each student to believe in themselves; they challenge them to excel and reach the highest of expectations, and to achieve academically, so they can become life-long learners who excel to their fullest potential.

During these few years, it is extremely important to make sure your child is in an environment that is both challenging and rewarding.

We believe that each child needs a safe and nurturing environment in which to explore and experiment. The program is designed to foster learning at each child’s own pace. Through age appropriate activities, each child can master skills in the areas of communication, cognitive and physical development, and social interaction. By experiencing success in each of these areas, a child becomes more confident and self-reliant. These positive learning experiences at an early age contribute to the child’s sense of self and emotional well-being. When children are presented with an opportunity to experience the world in an age appropriate and temperamentally appropriate setting, they will fulfill their inborn quest for learning.

With assistance and direction of knowledgeable and experienced teachers, young children can develop a strong sense of self through their accomplishments.
