This 2018-2019 school year promises to be loaded with many spiritually satisfying and educationally fulfilling opportunities. These experiences will encompass our school theme of “Jesus Show Me How To Be…, and help us grow closer to Him through our actions, our service to others, our positive relationships, and our efforts to spread His word. The theme will also grow as each month a new word of action will be the center of our school’s efforts. Spreading kindness is a great way to begin a new season as we concentrate on good deeds and healthy relationships. With this in mind, I would like to welcome all new families to the Family of the “Heart” and I pray that you experience a wonderful transition to our school. God has blessed us with teachers who challenge students to move beyond their own expectations reaching for more knowledge and applying it to solve problems and think critically. Our thirst to learn will be quenched in the classroom as well as through the many out-of-class experiences including field trips and after school activities.

The unwavering support of our current families and the environment they have helped to create have distinguished Sacred Heart from being an ordinary school.  We are far from average in all aspects of our makeup. A spirit of enthusiasm and excitement along with a vibrant atmosphere envelops SHS. We realize that when you entrust your children to us a safe environment filled with spiritual and educational nourishment is expected.   Sacred Heart is committed to deliver with a fervor that should please all.

As we reflect on 2017-18, it is quite obvious our students enjoyed many successes including our 1st trip to the nationals, in Chicago, with our Quiz Bowl Team. As usual, our Science Fair projects were showered with accolades from the state of Ohio including various monetary awards and scholarships. The 32 strong, that comprised our 8th grade class will be missed. They provided leadership and set examples for all to emulate. However, we are fortunate to have many other students ready and eager to continue their efforts. Artistically, through music, drama and the visual arts, we excelled. Athletically, our students garnered championships and earned 1st place honors. Academically, we strived to be the best with many accepting high school scholarships and commendations. Most importantly, spiritually, through our Living Stations, Rosary at the Nursing Homes, Christmas Play, weekly Mass, and daily prayers, we walked with Jesus more closely.

Our staff will travel beyond limits, to make sure all are welcome, all are respected and all are treated with dignity and compassion. We have a passion to teach, to nurture and to share our blessings with all who enter through our doors. Sacred Heart pledges to: Embrace and teach the Catholic Faith; Welcome all who desire to learn; Provide excellent academics and rich spiritual opportunities; and Live our love for God and others through service. Together let’s dive into the waters of the 2018-19 school year splashing each other, loving each other and caring about each other . We plan to have fun with friends and family surrounded by the Holy Spirit.  It doesn’t get any better than that!

The oldest of the parishes in Ashtabula, Saint Joseph Parish, opened an elementary school in September 1865 when the Reverend John Tracey was pastor. The building that is currently recognized as the school building was built in 1877. In the early years of the school, the Sisters of Saint Joseph and the Sisters of Charity from Cincinnati were engaged as teachers for the school. In 1897, the Holy Humility of Mary Sisters (the “Blue Nuns”) took charge of the educational program in the school.

In 1890, the growing population in the Ashtabula Harbor area led to the establishment of Mother of Sorrows Parish and the opening of Mother of Sorrows School. The founding principal was Miss Mary Cox. By 1892, the Sisters of Saint Joseph from West Baden, Pennsylvania were in charge of the educational operation of the school. In future years, the Sisters of the Benedictine order from Erie, Pennsylvania, the Sisters of Charity of Saint Augustine, the Sisters of Notre Dame and the Holy Humility of Mary Sisters staffed the school as teachers and administrators.

In September of 1954, Our Lady of Mount Carmel was opened under the leadership of Father Joseph A. Feicht..

Responding to the needs of the Ashtabula area, the Diocese of Youngstown recognized the need for a Catholic high school in the Ashtabula area in the early 1950’s. The Saint John school building was purchased on the June 24, 1952, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, for whom the school is named. The building was formerly the Station Avenue School and housed elementary classes from 1890-1952. In September 1953, Saint John High School opened. On November 5, 1953, the school building was destroyed by fire, delaying the formal dedication. While the building was rebuilt, classes were held in Saint Joseph School and the Pacific School annex. The formal dedication of the school was held on November 14, 1953. By September of 1954, the building was ready to re-open and all of the students were back under one roof. In 1963, growing enrollment led to the need for building on an addition.

The Reverend Joseph Feicht was the founding pastor and Sister Visitation (Elizabeth Staudt) H.H.M. was the first principal. The Sisters of the Holy Humility of Mary played a vital role in the academic and religious development of the school. Diocesan priests provided leadership and direction through a variety of academic and spiritual roles. Father John Hoey, Father Robert Flynn, Father Frederick Slavin, and Father Paul Tobin have had official positions, while priests serving the local parishes have also provided pastoral services to the students.

In 1989, the three area Catholic elementary schools, Saint Joseph, Mother of Sorrows and Mount Carmel underwent a consolidation plan and became the Ashtabula Catholic Elementary School (ACES) and were housed at Mother of Sorrows Parish and Mount Carmel Parish (for a short time the 7th and 8th grade of the consolidated school was housed at the St. John’s high school building).

In 1992, due to declining enrollment and accompanying financial problems, the Youngstown Diocese made the decision to close Saint John High School. Notwithstanding that decision, a committed and enthusiastic group of parents, teachers and community supporters banded together to re-open Saint John as an independent Catholic High School. After raising significant money to retire the school debt, this group sought to purchase Saint John from the diocese. The diocese agreed to sell the building and its contents to Saint John supporters for $100. In September of 1992, Saint John High School re-opened as an Independent Catholic High School under the governance of a Board of Directors.

In 1997, reorganization again took place. There was a consolidation of all of the Catholic schools in the Ashtabula area and Saint John Catholic School was born under the governance of the Youngstown Diocese. This was a K-12 school with two campuses: a K-6 campus at the Mount Carmel Parish on Columbus Ave. and a 7-12 campus at the Saint John Building on Station Ave.
 
In 2012 the Board was approached by a group of alumni and community members to purchase the Saybrook public school on Depot Road in Saybrook Township. The school would be able to house the enitre PreK-12 student body. The Board approached the Diocese about the possibility and in August 2012 the school opened the doors at the new location.

The new location underwent a major transformation with more than 200 volunteers assisting in the project. The school now has a new cafeteria and kitchen, new science labs, and many other state of the art facilities.

Throughout the years, the school has retained its commitment to fostering scholarship, faith and leadership. The family spirit, the importance of tradition, and the commitment to the young people of the area have allowed for the preservation of Catholic education in Ashtabula. It is a proud history and we embrace it as our legacy for the future.";"http://www.sjheralds.org/Default.aspx";"https://www.facebook.com/StJohnAshtabula/";"http://www.sjheralds.org/Employment.aspx";"http://www.sjheralds.org/EnrollmentForms.aspx";"http://www.sjheralds.org/Parent-StudentHandbook.aspx";;;;"x";"x";;"http://www.sjheralds.org/sysimages/logo.png";"7:30 am – 2:20 pm";"7:30 am – 2:20 pm";"7:30 am – 2:20 pm";"7:30 am – 2:20 pm";"7:30 am – 2:20 pm";"Closed";"Closed";

The school received a Purple Star Award from the Ohio Department of Education in May.

Scioto Ridge Elementary joins Liberty Middle School, Olentangy Hyatts Middle School, Olentangy Shanahan Middle School, Olentangy High School and Orange High School in earning the award, which was created this year.

The Ohio Department of Education's Purple Star Award recognizes schools that show a major commitment to serving students and families connected to our nation’s armed forces. Purple Star awardees receive a special Purple Star recognition to display in their buildings. The Purple Star Advisory Board, formed by the Ohio departments of Education, Higher Education, Veterans Services and Adjutant General, helps decide eligibility.

 A Purple Star school will receive the designation for two years. After two years, the school must reapply. The Purple Star emblem was selected because purple symbolizes support for military families.

There are 34,000 children in Ohio with one or more parents serving in the military. This includes the children of active duty, reserve and Ohio National Guard members. Some of these children will attend six to nine different schools throughout their K-12 educational experiences. In addition to changing schools often, a student also can be affected by a parent’s deployment. Schools can help students and families face these issues by connecting them with the resources they need.

“A supportive school environment can have a significant impact on our military-connected students,” said State Superintendent Paolo DeMaria. “These Purple Star schools provide our children and families with the resources they need to be successful. We’re thankful for their service and honored to continue the important work of improving services for Ohio’s military families.”";"https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/Scioto%20Ridge";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Scioto-Ridge-Elementary-School/1508533442767226";"https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/58";"https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/Page/962";"https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/cms/lib/OH01914664/Centricity/shared/elementary%20files/Official%202018-19%20ES%20Handbook%206-11-18.pdf";;;"x";"x";;;;"8:50 a.m - 3:40 p.m";"8:50 a.m - 3:40 p.m";"8:50 a.m - 3:40 p.m";"8:50 a.m - 3:40 p.m";"8:50 a.m - 3:40 p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

We believe that the best way to do that is for schools to partner with parents and the community to help educate children.

Parents are a critical factor in children’s educational success because they are a child’s first and best teachers. Research has shown that children whose parents are involved in their education perform at higher levels than those whose parents are not involved.

So we encourage parents to get involved in a variety of ways. Parents can make sure children understand the importance of education, and they can help children learn outside of school. Below are some tips for helping your elementary student learn at home as well as in school.

The first one is the most important: Read. Read to your child. Read with your child. Let your child see you reading every day, so that he or she understands the importance of learning to read well.

    Read to and with your child, and have your child read to you.
    Encourage your child to keep a journal of daily events.
    Keep books available to your child, and make regular trips to the public library.
    When you shop for groceries, have your child help you find items and then estimate the cost of the purchase.
    Discuss different kinds of jobs and careers in your community to help your child understand that school prepares them for a career.
    Visit museums, zoos and city art exhibits with your child.
    Help your child identify and set fitness goals. Make walking, hiking or biking a family activity.
    Talk to your child about the importance of education.
    Meet with your child’s teachers regularly to monitor progress.
    Compliment your child’s work and success in school.
    Make sure your child does each day’s homework assignment. Set aside a quiet place for homework and set a regular time each day for it.
    Listen to music together, and have art materials (crayons, paint, brushes, pencils, paper) available at home.

The district serves approximately 1,450 students yearly, and is comprised of four facilities, including one high school, one junior high school (serving grades 7-8), one intermediate school (serving grades 3-6), and one primary school (serving grades pre-k-2).  

The school district has excelled because of the unique combination of home, schools and community working collaboratively for all students within the city. Huron educators believe that in order to be competitive in the new century, schools must embrace change and create a high performing learning environment for students and teachers.

To meet the needs of the 21st century learner Huron City Schools curriculum is aligned with new State standards designed to challenge students pre-k through graduation. Instructional delivery is enhanced by hands on field experiences, digital and blended learning experiences, college partnerships through Dual Enrollment opportunities and Post Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEOP), Advanced Placement course work and partnerships with local agencies. Huron teachers, administrators and support staff participate in frequent intensive professional development activities designed to improve instructional strategies and instructional content.

Huron City Schools understands and embraces the role of technology in the education of children. Today’s learners enter school already immersed in a technologically driven society. Huron teachers utilize SMART board or TAP-it technology to enhance instruction by maximizing learning opportunities through digital experiences. All students have access to an array of mobile devices including carts of iPads, Chromebooks, and laptops while each building maintains traditional computer labs. The district is aggressively increasing the number and variety of mobile devices available at all grade levels. Huron will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure upgrades to allow for instant and seamless connectivity for all students. 

Huron City Schools recognizes the importance of extra curricular opportunities to supplement a rewarding pre-k through graduation educational experience for students. Elementary school offerings in choir, band, general music and art serve as the springboard for a life long appreciation of fine arts for many children. The Huron band routinely earns high marks for their performance at various regional and state competitions. 

Clubs, student organizations and community service activities are an important part of a holistic student experience. Huron offers many opportunities that engage students in the act of volunteerism. Students involved in Teen Leadership Corps and Student Council provide hands-on service and support throughout the year within the community. Developing a passion for civic responsibility in young people is something Huron City Schools takes seriously and is committed to achieving.

An athletic tradition beginning with a multitude of organized biddy programs has evolved over the years due to the accomplishments of many individuals and teams. Volunteers throughout the community continue to support Huron student athletes with their time and financial contributions. Huron City Schools is known for their acclaimed facilities that include the first local football stadium with artificial turf, a renovated soccer field, and a new baseball and softball complex.

Families receive a guide to the evaluation process during the first home visit.  Children receive a complete evaluation upon referral for services including: vision, hearing, nutrition and social-emotional screenings, developmental evaluation, parent interview, parent/child interaction observation and hands on evaluation from a therapist.  The team which includes parents, Service Coordinator, Developmental Specialists and therapists determines eligibility for Early Intervention services.  Eligible children and families receive an IFSP to determine strengths, needs, outcomes and individual services.  Per Early Intervention Rule the Bayley III assessment is used to determine eligibility for the program.  The Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System for Infants and Young Children (AEPS) is used as a curriculum and ongoing assessment tool.  The Early Intervention staff strives to provide all services in the child’s natural environment by making home visits and encouraging parent involvement and participation in therapy sessions.  Parents are given developmental questionnaires to help them monitor their child’s development.  The final duty of the Early Intervention team is to help the child and family transition to preschool.  Parents are given information to make decisions concerning the best preschool program for their child.  We introduce parents to the preschool team in their school district and participate in all meetings and evaluations to make a smooth transition to preschool services.

We have a dedicated staff that puts the needs of students at the forefront of all they do.  

 Our students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities and programs including; Accelerated Reader, student council, band, “Takin it to the Schools”, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, orchestra, choir, Young Authors, and the County Math Tournament.  Students can also take advantage of our walking club and basketball club which are held before school.    During the 2017/2018 school year, we added a morning reading program for third grade students and we also expanded our after school intervention sessions to include enrichment opportunities.   These are just a few of the experiences that are available to our students at South.
 
It is a priority at South for students to learn the value of “giving back.” Our students participated in many service projects such as Relay for Life, Coats for kids, and Rainbow Connection’s coin challenge.   Our student council also sponsored several activities throughout the year including Spirit Days to raise money for a variety of charities.  

 Our “Recess Rally” was a HUGE success again this past year.  Our students, families and sponsors raised over $12,000 to make needed improvements.    We appreciate all of the families and community members that have continued to support this event.  Watch for the new additions and more improvements coming soon.  

 South School houses over 400 students in grades preschool through fifth grade. Our preschool program earned a 5 star rating, the highest possible, from The Ohio Department of Education for the second year in a row for providing a quality program for children ages 3-5. 

 In addition to the opportunities provided by our teachers and staff; our South School PTG provided many fun and educational activities such as assemblies, field trips, and Santa Shop just to name a few.

Since that time, we have made it our goal to show our appreciation to our county for helping to support our efforts for new buildings, by providing the best instruction possible for all students.  Our mission is to provide an education of the highest quality that drives all of our students to excel while meeting their individual needs, developing their character and potential as we prepare them for the future. 

 

Our school lies in the center of three local villages, and we are proud to have strong ties to these communities.  Because of these ties, we are able to offer a number of character building and incentive programs for our students.  We believe that building character, compassion, and leadership skills is of the utmost importance.  One way we try to encourage these skills is through our Change of Heart program.  Students taking part in this program learn how to lead by example, and have a strong impact on the atmosphere of our school.  Another way we encourage students to do well is through our Homework Heroes program.  This is an incentive program that rewards students who consistently complete and turn in their homework.   Without the support of our community and the local businesses, programs such as these would not be possible.

 

Our staff believes that in order for children to be successful, schools and families must work together.  For this reason, we encourage parent volunteers, and try to organize several family events each year, such as our Fall Festival, Family and Community Night, Math and Author Night, and Awards Ceremonies each nine weeks.  Our goal is for students to feel confident and at home in their school.  For this reason, we chose the vision statement:  Strong Optimism Unites This Home.

To meet the demands of this special population, Spectrum provides highly structured self contained units where students remain with their assigned teaching team to access direct instruction in all core subjects. This model establishes a daily routine with minimal distractions and transitions thereby increasing attentive skills and academic performance.

Each classroom unit follows a specially designed curriculum map that aligns instruction with the common core state standards using state of the art methodologies and materials. A school wide positive behavior support system is a vital component of the Spectrum Program and has been designed to teach students coping strategies, responsibility, and resiliency to persevere. In the classroom, staff collect data on individualized target behaviors and use both visual aids and behavioral cues to assist students in making progress towards goal attainment. In addition to the innovative academic and behavioral programming, students receive social skills instruction based on research studies that indicates there is a high correlation between social skills development and the ability to succeed in school and beyond.

St. Augustine School educates children from preschool through the eighth grade.  Operated as a ministry of St. Augustine Parish and the Diocese of Toledo, the school serves the children of the parish and from adjacent parishes without Catholic schools.  St. Augustine School also welcomes non-Catholic children whose parents want to provide a value-based education for their children.

 

St. Augustine School emphasizes Catholic values through the curriculum with service projects, local and global mission efforts, and liturgical planning and participation.

 

The St. Augustine School philosophy parallels the Diocese of Toledo School district philosophy:

""St. Augustine School assists parents in preparing their children to assume their Christian vocation; in preparing their children to use their God-given abilities to develop their knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes; in preparing their children to become people of faith inside and outside the school setting; in preparing their children to integrate their experience of living and learning at each stage of their development; in preparing their children to understand we are all part of God's community; in preparing their children to work for themslves as well as the common good of the community of mankind; in preparing their children to pray.  Our ultimate goal is union with Jesus Chris, the way, the truth, and the life.""


Parents who choose St. Augustine to assist their efforts to educate their child are investing in their child's future by providing a lifelong gift. A solid academic program infused with Catholic values and supported by parents will go a long way to help children develop into mature Christian witnesses.

The Board of Education has the dual legal responsibilities of implementing statutory requirements for public education and fulfilling citizens’ desires for educating the community’s youth.

While the board has an obligation to assess citizens’ desires, it is understood that when citizens elect delegates to represent them in the conduct of public education, they endow their representatives with the authority to exercise their best judgment in making decisions that affect the school system.

The board believes its primary purpose is to ensure the optimal learning experience for the children enrolled in its schools. We believe that we should constantly aim toward having the best school system possible within available resources. We have long realized that achieving district success is virtually impossible without citizens’ participation. For that reason, we are convinced that the high level of success in the district is a reflection of the support we have received from the community.

Ground breaking for a combination temporary church and ten classroom school took place on Sunday afternoon, March 28, 1954. After hard work and the anxieties accompanying any building project, the buildings plus a rectory and convent were blessed and dedicated on Sunday, November 13, 1955. The school had opened in September 1955. 

Significant to the development of the parish school was the presence of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent dePaul, from Emmitsburgh, Maryland. They had been invited to the Diocese of Youngstown by Bishop Walsh to staff two parishes, one of them being Saint Christine. In 1955, four Daughters came to Youngstown and opened the school. They lived temporarily at St. Brendan Convent until the newly constructed convent was finished. 

The school enrollment grew rapidly from 350 pupils the first year in 1955, to 650 pupils the following year. Accordingly the original 10 classrooms had to be expanded to 24 classrooms in 1957, and to 32 classrooms in 1960, when enrollment was nearly 1500 pupils.  Total cost of the school when it was completed was $845,000.

The Daughters of Charity provided a strong presence in the school and in the parish through those years. The highest number present at any one time was 17 when the school enrollment peaked at 1554 pupils in 1965. At that time there were 32 classrooms with half taught by a sister, and the other half taught by lay persons. As enrollment began to decline and as there were fewer sisters, competent and dedicated lay women especially took over the administration and teaching responsibilities in the school. In 1985 a pre-school was added. In 1988 the Daughters of Charity could no longer staff the parish school and left. Since then the Principal has been a lay woman and the total school staffed by competent lay persons. 

Over the years the school has reflected many changes and improvements in education and curriculum, with the addition of a pre-school, kindergarten, music, physical education, computers and art. Over the years, the school has often been recognized for its excellence and high academic achievement. Today it numbers close to 375 students, Kindergarten through eighth grade";"https://www.stchristineschoolyoungstown.org/";"https://web.facebook.com/pg/St-Christine-School-419304811499805/";;"https://www.stchristineschoolyoungstown.org/72";"https://www.stchristineschoolyoungstown.org/media/1/St_%20Christine%20Student%20Parent%20Handbook%20%20%202017-18(1).pdf";;;"x";"x";"x";;"https://static.radiuswebtools.com/templates/stchristineschoolyoungstown-org_clear/images/logo.png";"7:50 - 2:20";"7:50 - 2:20";"7:50 - 2:20";"7:50 - 2:20";"7:50 - 2:20";"Closed";"Closed";

We are located in Delhi Township, 6 miles west of downtown Cincinnati.  The school, operated by St. Dominic Parish, is an Archdiocesan Roman Catholic elementary serving students in Pre-K through eighth grade.

St. Dominic School, “A Place to Grow”, proudly exists to serve the individual needs, both spiritual and educational, of the children of the parish and local community.

Our school strives to guide each student into becoming a faith-filled child of God through a strong religion program, numerous liturgical functions, active student ministries in the church and school, an emphasis on Catholic services and celebrations, an immersion in a character education program, and an active student-led Christian Service program.  Closely related to the spiritual development of each student is a strong academic program which utilizes differentiation as the groundwork to assist each child in recognizing his or her own potential. 

We are blessed with warm and caring staff members who are constantly searching for ways to grow professionally and spiritually.  Every year staff members apply for and received instructional grants to enhance their curriculum.  One of our teachers has attained National Board Certified Teacher while several others have received the NCEA Teacher of the Year Award for Region Six (Michigan and Ohio).  All faculty members serve on one of three school committees which work to continually improve every facet of the school. 

Knowing that the most important teachers for our students are their own parents, St. Dominic School strives to ensure parent support and involvement in many areas.  Each day parents volunteer in the building, work on PTO projects, or serve on the Education Commission.  The St. Dominic PTO has received the prestigious NCEA Home/School Award.

St. Dominic School has had the pleasure of witnessing the growth of many generations of students who are now doctors, engineers, attorneys, accountants, politicians, CEOs, and service persons.  Many of the graduates are faith-filled parents, grandparents, and great grandparents within the St. Dominic Parish community.  Since St. Dominic Parish opened its doors over seventy-five years ago, it is easy to see why St. Dominic School has become a place for children to grow.";"https://www.stdominic-k-8.org/";"https://web.facebook.com/stdominicdelhi/?_rdc=1&_rdr";;"https://www.stdominic-k-8.org/Portals/3/Files/Home/Preschool/Preschool%20Student%20Registration%20Form.pdf";"https://www.stdominic-k-8.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=g8pNjtzBSCs%3d&tabid=307&portalid=3";;;"x";"x";"x";;"https://www.stdominic-k-8.org/Portals/3/StDominicSchoolLogo185.png";"8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

Mission Statement
St. Paul 
Early Childhood Center 
will provide stimulus for growth and development of the whole 
child in a child
-
centered Christian environment.
Philosophy
St. Paul 
Early Childhood Center 
adheres to the philosophy of educating the “whole child” soul, 
mind, and body. The goal is to provide the children with the opportunity to grow and learn at 
their own rate and in their own way.
We believe in the academic/developmental approach of educating
the child. The developmental 
approach is based on the assumption that a child’s growth is sequential in nature and an orderly 
process involving spiritual, physical, emotional, social, language and cognitive growth, but that 
each child is a unique individu
al.
Being developmentally appropriate with a 3
-
5 year old child involves learning through “play” 
and “hands
-
on activities.” Children are introduced to growth concepts and encouraged to try out 
their ideas with emphasis on the process rather than the produc
t. They are given opportunities to 
interact with other children and adults in both large and small group settings, as well as on an 
individual basis to enhance their communication skills and social growth. Small group 
instruction will be planned with speci
fic growth goals in mind";"http://stpaulchuckery.360unite.com/";"https://web.facebook.com/pg/stpaulearlychildhoodcenter/";;"https://unite-production.s3.amazonaws.com/tenants/stpaulchuckery/attachments/140606/PS_Applic._for_Admiss_Form__2018-2019_.pdf";"https://unite-production.s3.amazonaws.com/tenants/stpaulchuckery/attachments/122649/2017-18_PS_student_handbook_-__rev..pdf";;;"x";"x";;;"https://unite-production.s3.amazonaws.com/tenants/stpaulchuckery/pictures/73765/ECC_Logo__4_.jpg";"8:30 a.m.-2:45p.m";"8:30 a.m.-2:45p.m";"8:30 a.m.-2:45p.m";"8:30 a.m.-2:45p.m";"8:30 a.m.-2:45p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

Our school is a place where children are deeply engaged in the excitement of learning, a process that both challenges and nurtures them and develops self-confidence, competency, imagination, and the desire to lead lives of positive influence. I am excited that you have considered our Catholic Montessori school for your child.

Our Montessori curriculum integrates a philosophy that promotes higher order thinking and abstract reasoning skills for students 3 years old through the 8th Grade. This remarkable program gives our students a deeper understanding of the connection between academics and the outside world. We are a community that understands and values the connection between younger and older students.

Success in school is directly tied to the degree to which children believe that they are capable and independent human beings. If they knew the words, even very young children would declare: “Help me learn to do it for myself!” By allowing children to develop a meaningful degree of independence and self-discipline, Montessori sets a pattern for a lifetime of good work habits and a sense of responsibility. Students are taught to take pride in doing things for themselves carefully and well. St. Joseph Montessori School fosters an enduring love of learning.";"https://www.sjms.net/";"https://web.facebook.com/SJMSColumbus?_rdc=1&_rdr";"https://www.sjms.net/employment-opportunities/";"https://www.sjms.net/enrolling-your-child/";"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5654ba39e4b0443d394016c2/t/5b807472575d1f3286bbc18b/1535145077453/ParentHandbook2018-19.pdf";;;;;;;"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5654ba39e4b0443d394016c2/t/56f17543b6aa60c4e73898ef/1539265149968/?format=1500w";"8:15:a.m.-6:00 p.m";"8:15:a.m.-6:00 p.m";"8:15:a.m.-6:00 p.m";"8:15:a.m.-6:00 p.m";"8:15:a.m.-6:00 p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

milford oh schoolIf you have not already done so, please take a moment and read our Mission and purpose Statement. As a Christian school, our educational goals are derived from a Biblical Christian philosophy of education. With small class sizes and support programs that challenge students’ potential, students are encouraged to think critically, make moral decisions about life and act on them as godly servant-leaders.

Most importantly, the students and visitors to our hallways often experience the presence of the Holy Spirit. We often refer to St. Mark’s as the school that connects students with Jesus. That is how the teachers and staff approach our ministry.

Uniting the traditions of the Church with current academic practices, our private school provides students in preschool through eighth grade a parochial education at a fraction of the cost of most other private institutions.

Accredited by the State of Ohio and under the direction of the Diocese of Columbus, St. Mary currently enrolls more than 300 students. The student to teacher ratio is 14/1. Our fully licensed staff participates in monthly professional development and works to individualize instruction for their students. St. Mary School welcomes all children to attend and learn in this caring, nurturing, and innovative environment. Students participate in service projects both at school and through the parish.

St. Mary School provides many opportunities for students to practice their faith. Through daily prayer and religion classes, weekly mass, a strong message of discipleship and participation in traditional Catholic sacraments and feasts, St. Mary students live out their faith. The strong impact of these early experiences in Church activities develops a moral guide for students as they face their future. Faith formation happens through living out the Gospel message.";"http://stmarydelaware.org/";"https://web.facebook.com/StMaryDelawareOhio/?_rdc=1&_rdr";;"http://stmarydelaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Registration-form.pdf";;;;"x";"x";"x";;"https://scontent.flhe2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/20479746_1390729861034570_6913183719990454878_n.png?_nc_cat=106&_nc_eui2=AeGN5FeRLDtyfDL8rBkJwAkXkFENobIT7EAS37M99rZ6dW4NyzIvVg5m0DdwcuzlreKM22Kpro9OSFUATPm6t04dbDO1Ir5V5By4P9m4QlxoykPD-nU7H84cYYL1DjuH3AQ&_nc_ht=scontent.flhe2-1.fna&oh=49df682c8028bc339d99664e4b91e183&oe=5C5D4A98";"8:00 a.m - 2:15p.m";"8:00 a.m - 2:15p.m";"8:00 a.m - 2:15p.m";"8:00 a.m - 2:15p.m";"8:00 a.m - 2:15p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

St. Mary’s offers families the option of all-day preschool and all-day Kindergarten along with an extended day option.  Our students come from all over Lorain County, and bussing is provided by the Elyria School District, Midview School District and Keystone School District.  We are providing a top notch private school education to children residing in the Elyria, LaGrange, Grafton, Eaton, and Oberlin areas.

As it has since 1859, a strong emphasis is of course placed on a faith centered education. Christian principles are integrated into the curriculum not only in formal study, but also as a way of life.  This is a welcomed change for families seeking an education that continues beyond math and English, and includes an emphasis on Christian morals and values.
In addition to an education that is second to none in the Lorain County area – St. Mary’s School proudly supports our numerous sporting and extra-curricular programs.

Where most schools leave off – St. Mary’s School of Elyria is just beginning. We do not stop at the basic requirement of a public school – which is to assist students in mastering basic educational skills.  St. Mary’s School takes it to the next level as we prepare our students for their future roles.  Not only do we make every effort through our teaching style to enhance the individual student’s self-esteem, but we work to nurture their leadership skills.  Students are taught self-discipline, and encouraged to foster a responsibility for peace and justice.  Our students do not need to be Catholic to attend St. Mary’s School.  They simply need to be open to a Christian education.  Is St. Mary’s tradition of excellence in Christian education the right fit for your child?  Call our office at 440-322-2808 for additional information, and to arrange a tour or classroom visit.";"http://www.stmarycatholicschoolelyria.com/";"https://web.facebook.com/pg/St-Mary-School-Elyria-352781504745430/";;"http://www.stmarycatholicschoolelyria.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Registration-2018-2019-1.pdf";"http://www.stmarycatholicschoolelyria.com/parents/policies/";;;;"x";"x";;"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0PQDF6suQeLqusElzklJ5FkwPwc7iV3n8OxICExbZLjNTsEuQJA";"8:00 a.m.-2:30 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-2:30 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-2:30 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-2:30 p.m";"8:00 a.m.-2:30 p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

The first Mass was celebrated in 1854 in a log house  that belonged to the village.  The first pastor of St. Mary of the Falls was named, Fr. Louis Fillieren, in 1856.  The parish school was started in 1873 and closed in 1900 during the financial panic that gripped the nation during that time.

In 1948, the first church was destroyed by a fire.  In 1949, the parish built the school building with the basement to be used as a church.  The school was staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph.  In 1958 because of increased enrollment, two portable buildings, former barracks, were were moved 35 miles from Christ the King Parish in East Cleveland to St. Mary of the Falls.  These became classrooms for the primary grades.

Our current all day kindergarten program was initiated in 1987 and in 1991 the first computer lab was built.  In 1997 the construction of the current school building began.  St. Mary of the Falls School celebrated its 60 year anniversary in 2009.  

Preschool (Preschool three, four, and PK) was added prior to 2009 where each year since it's beginning, our program has grown and expanded.

The mass was held in the auditorium of Avondale School with 250 in attendance. In order to assist with funding of the parish, clubs were formed by men and women. At this time babysitting clubs were also formed so that men and women could attend the meetings of the various clubs. This cooperative spirit has continued to be a part of the parish today. The parish was able to purchase a rectory in late 1952, and this housed the pastor as well as served as a gathering for weekday masses. The equipment for this was all donated, and the parish began to grow. The goal of the Fr. Hartmann was to make St. Michaels the home of ""friendly people."" Although the church was the main priority, members of St. Michaels were even more eager to provide a Catholic education for for their children. The first campaign dinner for this construction was launched in 1953, and within in 10 days $130,000 was raised for the cause. The school was officially established on November 23, 1953, with the arrival of the four sisters of Notre Dame to help prepare with the opening. The first communion class of 1954 consisted of 22 students, and 6 students graduated that same year. The first outside activities were also created in 1954, and these included Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Club Scout troops, as well as San Michel Club for teenagers and a Garden Club for women. The parish has since grown in both size and population, and has recently celebrated it's 60th anniversary in 2012. It has grown to accomodate 2,300 families with over 900 families in the grade school and the school of religion.

The top floor was shared with the Sisters of the Precious Blood that taught at the school.  This “red brick school” served the parish well.  The cost to build the school was $2,661.84

“St. Patrick Free School”, as it was called, opened with nearly 50 students.  Operating expenses were met through an assessment of $2.40 from each parishioner over the age of 16.  The word “free” was appropriate because there was no tuition to attend the school.

Ground breaking for a new school took place in November of 1952, with the cornerstone being put in place on April 10, 1953.  The new school had 8 of the most modern classrooms, separate playgrounds for boys and girls, and a beautifully equipped kitchen.  This new state of the art building opened to students on September 14, 1953.";"https://sites.google.com/stpattroy.org/stpatrickcatholictroy/home";"https://web.facebook.com/stpattroy/";;"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzdHBhdHJpY2t0cm95c2Nob29sfGd4OjUxMmRiNWZiZTNmOWU2NA";;;;"x";;"x";;"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UjE18l552yEE_2TpSkp2kuVUfbBLSDJd0yLwISM4n3BMO6y4yuHjy9nCjUd_mjZJs5jPsJGx=w16383";"8:15am - 3:15pm";"8:15am - 3:15pm";"8:15am - 3:15pm";"8:15am - 3:15pm";"8:15am - 3:15pm";"Closed";"Closed";

The parish was officially “born” on June 7, 1956, when Fr. James Brogan was appointed associate pastor at Maumee St. Joseph, armed with a list of 615 families who would become his new parish. Legend has it that Fr. Brogan visited each and every one of those households personally.

On September 23, 1956, a meeting of the new parish was held at Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and the name “St. Patrick” was chosen upon the Bishop’s recommendation. Fr. Brogan’s middle name, by the way, was Patrick.
Before the church was built, the first Masses were held in the auditorium of Heatherdowns School; there were four Masses each Sunday, with Fr. William Seelaus, an Oblate from St. Francis deSales High School assisting Fr. Brogan.
The first Sunday collection at St. Pat’s totaled $4,914.82.

Ground was broken for the church and school on St. Patrick’s Day – March 17, 1957. A St. Patrick’s Day party followed – in a tradition that was kept for 37 years.
The first Mass celebrated on St. Pat’s property was in November of 1957, in the basement of the new building.

The first Mass celebrated in the church building was Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve 1957.

In the winter of 1957, at the direction of the Bishop, a house was purchased on what is now Green Valley to serve as a temporary rectory. Fourteen years later, a house down the road was built by parishioner Ken Mossing to serve as the convent. Beginning in 1990 events came full circle and the convent house now serves as the rectory.

In September of 1958, 527 students started their school year at St. Patrick’s School in the West wing, now known as Seton Hall. As St. Pat’s rapidly grew, in 1960 the East Wing – what is now known as Neumann Hall – was added, complete with 13 more classrooms.

In 1963, the new rectory, now called the Crites Community Center, was completed, and served as home to three pastors, 22 other priests (including the late Bishop James Hoffman), six seminarians, three youth directors, and numerous others in its 27 years as a residence. The Crites Center was named after Peg and Chuck Crites, who were longtime volunteer workers during the years of Fr. Brogan and Fr. Wilhelm.";"http://toledostpatsschool.org/";"https://web.facebook.com/StPatrickOfHeatherdowns/?_rdc=1&_rdr";;"toledostpatsschool.org/registration";"https://cld.bz/fjYsKTo";;;;"x";;;"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.cloversites.com/24/24cd79d3-d14b-4e86-95f9-83e447bb7a43/site-images/4344e28a-9285-4faf-b722-b72f658d8bbc.png";"8:45a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:45a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:45a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:45a.m.-3:00 p.m";"8:45a.m.-3:00 p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

With Christ as the model for our faculty and the inspiration of our students, St. Pius X School provides its students with opportunities to regularly attend liturgies and participate in the sacraments; to study the Gospels and to practice their Catholic faith; to pray daily; to share in community; and to participate in global service projects. We are committed to sharing the parents the responsibility for developing Christ-centered, self-motivated, life-long learners.

It is our privilege to partner with the families of our students in order to provide an education that includes spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and physical development. It is our hope that through this Catholic education each child will develop into a mature Christian who is well prepared to move confidently into the next phase of becoming a responsible adult.

It is our obligation to encourage children and to listen to them so that each grows according to the design written into his/her being. We believe that the school, in collaboration with the parents, can meet these challenges.

Philosophy
We believe that each child is a unique gift created by God. It is our job as educators to work closely with parents to assist each child in their educational development. The experiences that a child has in the first years of their lives are important in the child’s growth and development.

Our curriculum is designed to meet the needs of the whole child, complete with activities and experiences incorporated to enhance each child’s spiritual, cognitive, language, social and physical development.

While continuing our long tradition of excellent education in core subjects taught in a faith-based environment, St. Sebastian also stays on the forefront of educational technology and teaching methods. This year we celebrated the opening of our Innovation Lab, a maker-space classroom that houses an amazing array of educational materials and offers a large, flexible space for project-based, active learning.

 

Our school’s impressive technology resources include a 1:1 technology program for grades 6-8, more than 250 laptops and iPads for use by younger grades, SMARTboards in every classroom, a state-of-the-art Science Lab, and a brand new Technology Learning Lab featuring new computers and a 3D printer. St. Sebastian recently earned designation as a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) school by the Ohio Department of Education in recognition of our comprehensive curriculum that integrates STEM practices such as problem-based learning, critical thinking, and hands-on activities on all grade levels.

 

As a Catholic school dedicated to developing the whole student, St. Sebastian embraces STREAM education, which adds religion as a core component to the STEM approach. In addition to daily religion classes and weekly Mass, students participate in many service projects and our curriculum emphasizes service learning, such as harvesting produce from the school garden to donate to the Good Samaritan Hunger Center.

 

Our school’s mission statement is “St. Sebastian School is dedicated to Christ and committed to excellence in education. We honor the Catholic traditions of the past, work to develop our talents today, and prepare for Christian service in the future.” I invite all who are interested in our school to come visit, we’d be happy to show you how our students and faculty live out the mission of the school every day!

Our experienced staff includes 28 lay teachers and one Franciscan Sister. We have the benefit of a full-time music teacher, PE teacher, Art teacher, Computer teacher, Spanish teacher, remedial reading specialist, remedial math specialist, intervention specialist, speech pathologist, school counselor, school nurse, textbook clerk, and classroom aides.  Our student-to-teacher ratio is 21 to 1.
St. Veronica School has placed strong emphasis on providing quality educational opportunities for all students. We have a fully-operational science lab for 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students. The media center affords 30 computer stations to the students and staff who have access to the Internet and internal e-mail. There are smart boards and additional computers in our classrooms and three wireless laptop carts.

We are dedicated to inspiring a love for learning and empowering students to reach their potential in spiritual growth, academic achievement, creativity and citizenship. Our priority is to keep Christ in our mind, body, and heart in all that we do. Our students receive opportunities and experiences which develop their skills and talents to solve real-world problems. As a state STEM designated school in the Diocese of Cleveland, we integrate the research-based best practice of problem-based learning in the curriculum. We partner with community groups and businesses to help bring awareness to their cause and solve problems they may have within their organizations. Past partnerships have included The Akron Zoo, St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, Hattie Larlham, Wastebits, Cleveland Water Alliance, and St. Bernard Parish. At St. Vincent de Paul Parish School we believe children learn best in a positive faith-filled environment with guidance from teachers who genuinely care for all students and their success.
