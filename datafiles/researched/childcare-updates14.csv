It is a multi-level program that believes in a curriculum that supports the student’s growth and development according to the child’s own unique needs and abilities. The teachers act as facilitators and guide the learning of their students. Our classrooms feature motivating activities, with attention to learning styles, multiple intelligences, and interests, as well as abilities. Individual differences are met through small groupings that are short term and flexible. When students are motivated, they will do their very best and be proud of their efforts. In this environment, students are more willing to work, thereby raising their level of achievement.

CDA is situated on a 7-acre campus a half mile north of downtown Springboro, off of St Rte. 741. The campus features 4 buildings for classrooms and a multi-purpose facility, Impact Point, focused on the arts & fitness. The lovely grounds consist of gardens which include butterfly, imagination, edible and Ohio wildlife prairie as well as 2 soccer fields, basketball court, 2 playgrounds, a fossil pit, and an outdoor classroom.

This ordinance set aside land for school purposes. At one time, Violet Township was home to 19 one to two room schools spread across the township. The bulk of these schools later became combined into the Pickerington Local School District.

The first documented school in the Pickerington area was in 1812. It is believed that the log cabin housing, the school, may have been used for church on Sundays for church and school during the week.

In 1815 Abraham Pickering, whom the City of Pickerington is named after, donated a plot of land to be used for educational purposes. The Pickerington School House was built on this land, and in 1883, a new two-story, two room school was built to replace the original building.

According to census data, in 1895, The Pickerington School educated 105 students. This site today is home to the Pickerington and Violet Township Historical Society, 15 E. Columbus Street.

The Violet Township Board of Education was created in 1905, as the first step in unification of the area schools. After two years of hard work, a charter from the state was in hand, and the process for financing a building program was in place. Construction of the new Violet Township High School (VTHS) began in February of 1907. The building would have six rooms plus a basement at a cost of $15,000. The VTHS class of 1909 was the first to graduate from this new school with a graduating class of four.

In 1939, Violet Township Schools became Pickerington Local Schools and VTHS became Pickerington High School a year later.

Driven by a dynamic and caring staff, Pickerington Local Schools has grown from a shared one-room school in a log cabin to 14 modern facilities educating approximately 10,600 students, making it the 15th largest school district in Ohio.

The Ohio Secretary of State certified Pickerington as a city in 1991. At 11.1 square miles, Pickerington is the second largest city in Fairfield County. The City of Pickerington, located just east of Columbus, Ohio, offers a combination of city amenities and small town friendliness. The city features a historic downtown shopping area, while Violet Township is home to rolling hills, forest and fields.";"https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/tussing-elementary/";"https://www.facebook.com/PickeringtonSchools";;"https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/tussing-elementary/enroll-update-contact-information/";"https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-19-ES.MS-Handbook-FINAL-1.pdf";;;"x";"x";;;"https://scontent.fkhi11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/10733995_10153977134409829_7511460959025495618_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_eui2=AeHx_9RCZ9ApXo4Jd2HDzl6BpwSU8oyxYBkZHuCDIAaWgGFlrG6PbTejGo9190fVUMoqqQylgkS7NlLTFw6pl2riUOVwDFTjo8FdPQTkFofXVw&_nc_ht=scontent.fkhi11-1.fna&oh=06f5aab028bf42d2cf03992a5c8eaca4&oe=5C812339";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"Closed";"Closed";

It is our strong believe that every child has to be introduced to dance, art, and music from a very early age. Learning through play is viewed as the cornerstone of the curriculum.

Adults provide protection, security, stimulation, support, limits and affection. Children are respected as individuals within a child-oriented rather than teacher-directed program.

At the Ukrainian Academy, children are given the opportunity to explore materials and participate in a variety of experiences. Activities are carefully planned and implemented in an open-classroom setting.

Children are free to choose from age appropriate activities including art, music, language development, pre-math skills, science and nature, and dramatic play.

you join us this year! The Perrysburg Preschool Program is eager to begin this exciting journey

The Perrysburg Preschool Program believes each child is an important member of our
district who deserves to be supported and challenged to reach his or her greatest potential. All
children are unique in personality, learning styles, developmental levels, strengths and needs.
We firmly believe each child is capable of learning and should be supported through
research-based strategies that promote optimal learning opportunities.
The Perrysburg Preschool Program is a developmentally-appropriate, integrated
program that provides services to children who are typically developing as well as those with
special needs from the ages of 3–5. Our curriculum—the 
​
Assessment, Evaluation, and
Programming System
​
—is endorsed by the Ohio Department of Education and is developed to
meet the needs of each child’s varying strengths and needs. It is a play-based curriculum, which
supports children’s learning in all areas of development and creates a foundation for school-age
achievement. Your child will be involved in hands-on learning experiences that utilize the
principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) through multiple means of representation,
expression and engagement, which supports students to become lifelong learners. Additionally,
utilizing UDL approaches give children of varying needs opportunities to participate in learning
by building on each child’s strengths.";"http://www.perrysburgschools.net/perrysburgpreschool_home.aspx";"https://www.facebook.com/PerrysburgPreschool/";"http://www.perrysburgschools.net/Employment.aspx";"http://www.perrysburgschools.net//Preschool.aspx";"http://www.perrysburgschools.net/Downloads/Preschool%20Handbook%20052118.pdf";;;"x";"x";;;"https://scontent-mrs1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/23843240_1442350902548215_4874108977635474150_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_eui2=AeGJO8iGiou3koeYXym810bvNR8cDivAw-1S19SPAXtzk7tBcK35RPwLuG4I8aa4DRQ8niGKB5SpHmbmrS69JRg9ClExY7zcQqWcVN8IoTzDZA&_nc_ht=scontent-mrs1-1.xx&oh=b0ad957ff9960617807f6ba5ae601ced&oe=5C529523";"9:15 a.m - 3:15 pm";"9:15 a.m - 3:15 pm";"9:15 a.m - 3:15 pm";"9:15 a.m - 3:15 pm";"9:15 a.m - 3:15 pm";"Closed";"Closed";

Welcome to the Village Academy website. We are pleased to have you visit, and invite you to learn more about the School.  At the core of the School’s goals and objectives is the mission that guides our philosophy of encouraging academic excellence, individual accountability, and social responsibility in a global community.

Village Academy’s heritage is based on a diverse student body from different countries, cultures, races and religions.  We embrace that diversity today as we feel it’s important for children to have a broad and global perspective of the world.  We also believe that the best learning environment should be warm, friendly and free of social pressure.  We specifically nurture a positive and inviting environment where children treat each other with respect and consideration.  In fact, we insist on it.

This ordinance set aside land for school purposes. At one time, Violet Township was home to 19 one to two room schools spread across the township. The bulk of these schools later became combined into the Pickerington Local School District.

The first documented school in the Pickerington area was in 1812. It is believed that the log cabin housing, the school, may have been used for church on Sundays for church and school during the week.

In 1815 Abraham Pickering, whom the City of Pickerington is named after, donated a plot of land to be used for educational purposes. The Pickerington School House was built on this land, and in 1883, a new two-story, two room school was built to replace the original building.

According to census data, in 1895, The Pickerington School educated 105 students. This site today is home to the Pickerington and Violet Township Historical Society, 15 E. Columbus Street.

The Violet Township Board of Education was created in 1905, as the first step in unification of the area schools. After two years of hard work, a charter from the state was in hand, and the process for financing a building program was in place. Construction of the new Violet Township High School (VTHS) began in February of 1907. The building would have six rooms plus a basement at a cost of $15,000. The VTHS class of 1909 was the first to graduate from this new school with a graduating class of four.

In 1939, Violet Township Schools became Pickerington Local Schools and VTHS became Pickerington High School a year later.

Driven by a dynamic and caring staff, Pickerington Local Schools has grown from a shared one-room school in a log cabin to 14 modern facilities educating approximately 10,600 students, making it the 15th largest school district in Ohio.

The Ohio Secretary of State certified Pickerington as a city in 1991. At 11.1 square miles, Pickerington is the second largest city in Fairfield County. The City of Pickerington, located just east of Columbus, Ohio, offers a combination of city amenities and small town friendliness. The city features a historic downtown shopping area, while Violet Township is home to rolling hills, forest and fields.";"https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/violet-elementary/";"https://www.facebook.com/SuperVioletES/";;"https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/violet-elementary/enroll-update-contact-information/";"https://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-19-ES.MS-Handbook-FINAL-1.pdf";;;;;;;"https://scontent.fkhi11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/10733995_10153977134409829_7511460959025495618_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_eui2=AeHx_9RCZ9ApXo4Jd2HDzl6BpwSU8oyxYBkZHuCDIAaWgGFlrG6PbTejGo9190fVUMoqqQylgkS7NlLTFw6pl2riUOVwDFTjo8FdPQTkFofXVw&_nc_ht=scontent.fkhi11-1.fna&oh=06f5aab028bf42d2cf03992a5c8eaca4&oe=5C812339";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"9:15 a.m - 4:05 pm";"Closed";"Closed";

We are so happy that you are joining us and entrusting us with the education of your children. We have an outstanding staff of teachers and support personnel to educate your child and to keep your child safe here at school. We are very proud of the work that we do, instilling integrity and other positive character traits in our students, and we strive to give your child wonderful experiences throughout his or her elementary school years.

As we go through the school year, there are some things that you should keep in mind: the school day begins at 8:30, and to ensure that your child has the best chance to succeed, make sure that your child is present and on time. A good night’s sleep and a well-balanced diet will go a long way to helping your child do well in school, and reading to your child or having your child read to you will reinforce the importance of becoming a good reader.

I can assure you that your child’s teachers have the same goals as you – they want your child to learn and to succeed. I have directed the teachers to maintain contact with you throughout the school year, and I expect them to keep you informed. Working together, families and the school will be able to create a positive year of academic growth for each child at Warder Park Wayne. Should you have questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to contact me either by email or by telephone.

Ideally, each child has the same teachers for multiple years. This gives teachers the opportunity to truly know and understand each child and determine how to both entice and engage children in the learning process. Montessori educators carefully prepare their classroom environments to allow each child to construct his/her own learning. The children gain confidence over time, unlocking their potential and setting them on a path of discovery for life.

The school engages families in the learning process for each child. Expectations for parent involvement and responsibilities are detailed in the School/Parent Partnership Agreement that each family signs annually. Parents observe, volunteer, attend parent education programs and child development classes, and receive regular communication via the online weekly newsletter and blog posts. WSM, in conjunction with the Parents’ Association Coordinating Committee (PACC), provides numerous opportunities for involvement in special events and programs. Teachers and parents often communicate via email or telephone.

At West Side Montessori the “prepared environment” includes a culture of mutual respect that encourages children to take responsibility for their own behavior and learning, including taking appropriate risks. Children are empowered to make choices and decisions, practice leadership, and engage in the world beyond our walls. The balance of freedom and responsibility practiced at West Side Montessori sets our students on the path to seek and love learning.";"http://www.montessoritoledo.org/?module=Page&sID=contact";"https://www.facebook.com/pg/WSMontessori/";"http://www.montessoritoledo.org/?module=Page&sID=employment";"https://pws.inresonance.com/school/montessoritoledo/index.php#login";"https://www.montessoritoledo.org/files/Parent%20Handbook%20Revised%209.14.18.pdf";;"x";"x";"x";"x";;"https://scontent.fkhi11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c9.0.200.200/p200x200/13419242_1392905074060419_1671065372529880843_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_ht=scontent.fkhi11-1.fna&oh=87f0c1257eaaa230bb2c77fcd0e9d5d9&oe=5C83E690";"8:15 a.m  -3:30p.m";"8:15 a.m  -3:30p.m";"8:15 a.m  -3:30p.m";"8:15 a.m  -3:30p.m";"8:15 a.m  -3:30p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

Due to a burgeoning population (some 1,000 to 1,200 students) in the 1950s, the school underwent a number of additions and expansions. In 1957, a new auditorium-gymnasium was constructed as part of the third addition to the school in a decade. The old gym was converted into eight classrooms, bringing the total number to 44 classrooms.

The school also saw many educational changes over the years. In 1968, Westwood was split into two sections, with kindergarten through third grades in one area and fourth through seventh grades in another. The goal, according to then-principal Bill Harrison, was to “give the students closer supervision by specialists.” At that point, Westwood had more than 1,600 students.

The school was closed in 1982.

Ground was broken in November 2006 for the new school, which is built on the original site of Westwood Park. The site was acquired through collaboration with the City of Dayton. The official opening of Westwood PreK-8 School was held on Aug. 23, 2008. It officially became a PreK-6 school for the 2016-17 school year after a district reconfiguration.

The elementary school is located at 1821 Lincoln Road, right next to the Public Library and in close proximity to the Middle School. Enrollment each year is around 570 students. Perhaps this human element is the best attribute of all in our school. Dedicated and caring faculty and staff have created a wonderful school environment for children and a strong working relationship with parents and the PTO. We support each other in promoting the best for children in the Wickliffe community.

Wickliffe Elementary School has many strengths of which the community is justly proud. Although the original building was completed in 1923, and there have been several additions over the years, the building retains a special charm. Wickliffe Elementary incorporates the best of a small, hometown school atmosphere with the modern educational practices one would expect to see in a busy suburban area.

Our school reflects the long-standing traditions of the Wickliffe community in its warm, nurturing environment and embraces the technology and skills our students will need to further their learning into their adult years. Technology and Science Lab experiences are part of every student’s weekly schedule at WES; as is instruction in Physical Education, Art, Music and Library Resources. Distance Learning opportunities literally bring the world into our school via our lab resources.

The combined efforts of our community, families and staff have propelled Wickliffe Elementary School into excellence by many measures. The State of Ohio consistently rates Wickliffe Elementary as “Excellent” based on student achievement scores on annual state assessments. More importantly, our students, through their commitment to achieving their “personal best” demonstrate that Wickliffe Elementary is an excellent place to begin their lifelong journey of learning.";"http://www.wickliffeschools.org/wickliffeelementary_home.aspx";;"http://www.wickliffeschools.org/Employment.aspx";"http://www.wickliffeschools.org/EnrollmentForms.aspx";"www.wickliffeschools.org/Downloads/Wickliffe%20Preschool%20Handbook%202016-2017.docx";;;"x";;;;"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7Cpe9wkI5tnQrQFovCAL0jFWuGcD_NhwEUFB2Z3vtY1jC30RY";"8:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m";"8:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m";"8:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m";"8:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m";"8:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m";"Closed";"Closed";

We have over 2200 students and are the largest school building with over 470 students.  We are pk-8 building offering multiple classes at each grade level and music and PE, inclusive classrooms, project based learning and center based classrooms.  We are working to offer a richer curriculum through a grant writing program to expand our science and math curriculum to offer our students a more hands-on learning experience.  Additionally, we offer a Positive Behavioral Rewards program where students are rewarded daily for reaching their individual goals in behaviors and academics.  Students may receive class DoJo and Redskin Reward $$ for their hard work that can then be cashed in at our store.  To date over $1500.00 in prizes have been purchased through this store!!!  We open our doors for monthly community events including a back to school fair, fall harvest, grandparents/ grand-friend trick or treat, Christmas movie and Craft night and are currently planning an open house activity for parents with a guest speaker to help with the new common core math standards.  We invite you to stop in, take a tour and see what our school has to offer!";"https://woodsfield.sk12.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Woodsfield-Elementary-School/745031538909242";"https://sk12.org/human-resources/";"https://sk12.org/employee-docs/";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All preschoolers must be completely potty-trained (no assistance is required) before the school year starts.

Xenos Christian School’s preschool program focuses on the development of the whole child and includes opportunities for the students to improve their social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual and physical skills. We encourage enthusiasm for learning by giving each child an opportunity to explore developmentally appropriate activities.

Research shows that the preschool experience lays the foundation for future academic success.

Additionally, Edison bestows unprecedented visual and performing arts opportunities to our K-8 students. Edison School of the Arts is a located just blocks southwest of downtown’s center. We boast a beautiful learning garden, chickens that we harvest eggs from, a great view of downtown Indianapolis, a gorgeous view of Indianapolis’s White River, outdoor learning spaces, a soccer field, and many butterfly and flower gardens. Edison is a one-of-a-kind school in Indianapolis as there is not another school in a 50-mile radius that has the level of arts offerings, true arts integration, and architectural features for the arts such as a dance studio, black box theater, digital design lab, piano lab, band and strings room and more! Edison’s Leadership team would like to add a note about our data. Edison’s decline in state rating was an unfortunate result of circumstances that were out of Edison’s control. In 2014-2015 Edison retained their B rating under Nathan Tuttle’s leadership. In 2015-2016, Indiana completely overhauled their performance rating criteria to be more growth oriented. As many schools in the state of Indiana dropped drastically, many from A-F, Edison only slipped to a C and were noted by Indianapolis Public Schools as having the second highest growth in the 3-5 grades in the district. In the summer of 2016, Edison School of the Arts was recognized by the district as a highly sought-after program. Edison was asked to expand its k-5 program to add grades 6, 7, and 8. Edison added approximately 200 new students in middle school. This addition of students that had not experienced Edison’s teachers in younger grades came to Edison, many unprepared, and overall testing extremely low. These students had very low achievement and growth. Edison, unfortunately dropped to a D. In the midst of the decline, Edison’s African American males scored 5% higher than the district. Edison’s 3rd grade students scored a phenomenal 92% on the state’s third grade reading test known as IREAD-3. We were also encouraged that students that we previously had in 5th grade that continued into 6th grade with us, had greater growth than other middle school testing grades. Edison’s students also scored almost 20% higher in science than the IPS district.";"https://www.myips.org/edisonschoolofthearts";"https://www.facebook.com/edisonarts47/";"https://www.myips.org/jointeamips";"https://www.myips.org/domain/1033";;;;;;;;"https://scontent-mrs1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/13434979_525995347584224_8011829586888338129_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&_nc_ht=scontent-mrs1-1.xx&oh=ed187dabb988e50649cac3bfa3ae78cc&oe=5C458191";"7:20am - 2:20pm";"7:20am - 2:20pm";"7:20am - 2:20pm";"7:20am - 2:20pm";"7:20am - 2:20pm";"Closed";"Closed";

Old school #39 was originally built in 1895 in a large field with farms surrounding it. It was later named after William McKinley, 25th President of the United States (1896-1901). When it was first built, it was considered a rural school. As Indianapolis grew, School #39 was an important part of the historical district known as Fountain Square. The old school was located at the corner of State Street and Lexington. William McKinley is currently located one block north of the old School #39 between Fletcher Avenue and Spann Avenue on State Avenue. It was built in 1988 and has since been remodeled.

Lowell students and staff have worked together since 1994 to develop and maintain our Outdoor Lab, which includes several outdoor learning environments including a pond, walking trail, and prairie. A log cabin was completed in August, 1999 with the help of volunteers and community members, including a local unit of the National Guard. We strive to offer rigorous coursework both through classroom resources and learning as well through our outdoor learning environment.  

Lowell School, working together with the home and community, provides a safe, orderly, and trusting environment where students acquire meaningful academic achievement and social skills which will enable them to become responsible members of society.

We believe...

    that encouraging excellence promotes high achievement.

    that being present and engaged in the learning process contributes to personal success.

    that family involvement benefits student achievement.

    that respecting individuals and cultures is necessary for a positive learning climate.

    that curriculum should be personalized, integrated, relevant, and extend beyond the classroom to promote lifelong learners.

    that each individual is important and must be treated with civility and respect.

    that an orderly and caring environment contributes to positive attitudes and personal success for learners.

ICES features an extended school year, highly qualified teachers, well-rounded curriculum, and community-based support. ICES strives to make a difference in the lives of our students by preparing them not only academically but as contributing members of society.

At all three Irvington Community School campuses, student achievement is our highest priority. ICES students are exposed to a rigorous curriculum from kindergarten – 5th grade. Learning is evident through a full range of classroom assessments, as well as through standardized testing and test preparation. ICES subscribes to the Northwest Evaluation Association’s assessments, which students take in the fall, winter, and spring to track academic growth. Grades three-five take Indiana’s ISTEP+ exams. All students are also evaluated to establish their independent reading levels using the Fountas & Pinnell Guided Reading assessment. Through this combination of assessments, students’ academic growth is measured and any areas of needed intervention are identified.

ICES faculty deliver a high-quality, foundation-building educational experience to all of our students. Instructional assistants are available to support student learning through small-group instruction and 1:1 intervention. Instructional coaches provide interventions for the most at-risk learners as well as support the teaching staff and instructional program. ICES also has a full-time licensed school counselor to assist students with their social and emotional development, as well as a dean of students who coaches children to learn appropriate behavior in keeping with The Irvington Way.";"http://www.ics-charter.org/irvington-community-elementary-school/";"https://www.facebook.com/irvingtonschools";;"http://www.ics-charter.org/enrollment-application/";"http://www.ics-charter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IPA_2018-19_Handbook.pdf";;;;;"x";;"https://scontent-sin2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/13680995_1084548884962220_6714696668377180152_n.png?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent-sin2-1.xx&oh=cc2ae395a84c298c594bc51fc34be89f&oe=5C401F73";"8:00 AM

We Believe:

    All Children can learn
    Education is the foundation for life success
    Each student is an individual who is deserving of respect, fairness, and understanding.

Our instructional philosophies center around research-based educational best practices and strategies to ensure students are learning based upon the Indiana Academic Standards. We try to meet each child where they are in their learning process and build from there.

A strong emphasis on phonics instruction in the early grades gives students the skills they need decode unknown words. We regularly assess student understanding in the areas of phonics, phonemics, vocabulary, comprehension and fluency in Kindergarten through sixth grade, to ensure that all students are fluent readers.

We also regularly assess student learning through the district-wide benchmark testing in Language Arts and Math. Through these assessments individual student strengths and weaknesses are examined, and lessons are carefully planned so we can provide the appropriate instruction to ensure continual progress.

The original Central was replaced by a new larger facility which opened on August 12, 2003, at 7001 Zionsville Road. It is on the same 155-acre campus as the Metropolitan School District of Pike Township's Administrative Services Center, Pike High School, Lincoln Middle School, and the Pike Public Library.
 
Today, teachers, administrators, and students at Central Elementary are continuing their school's proud tradition of excellence, which includes Four-Star School designations from the Indiana Department of Education, a national recognition for closing the achievement gap, a national drug-free school award, a state drug-free award, and accreditation by the Indiana Department of Education, with strong academic programs and a comprehensive curriculum. And, a dedicated Parent Teacher Association offers parents, our most important partners in the educational process, the opportunity to serve in the classroom and assist with other valuable PTA sponsored activities, which support our fabulous students and outstanding educators.

The corporation covers 33 square miles. We have students coming from the community of Decatur Township.  Our school is one of five elementary schools in Decatur Township.

 

Though our school is in a large metropolitan area, the landscape surrounding the school property is largely rural.  Located on a wooded lot that is bordered by Goose Creek, West Newton Elementary has been in existence since 1870.  Quaker pioneers founded their church and school simultaneously.  They combined respect for family, learning, and equity that is still an integral focus of our school today.  West Newton Elementary focuses on the development of the primary elementary learner as well as the intermediate elementary learner in grades one through six. The average enrollment for West Newton Elementary for the 2017-2018 school year was 665 students.  Currently, for the 2018-2019 year enrollment is at 617.

 

West Newton Elementary offers core subjects of reading, language arts, math, science, and social studies.  The teachers in grades one through four operate in self-contained classrooms while the remaining grades five and six classrooms use a transitional community approach, having each student see multiple teachers per day.

 

            Special Area offerings at West Newton Elementary include physical education, art, general music, and media class.
