Operating in Lincoln since 1966, our programs focus on readiness – children ready for school, families ready to support their children’s development, and schools ready to prepare the children who walk through their doors to graduate from high school. We ensure that our community’s most vulnerable children are provided the cognitive, social-emotional, physical, and linguistic interventions they need to be ready for kindergarten. Our programs extend beyond the child to serve the whole family. ";"http://www.communityactionatwork.org/programs/early-childhood-education/";"https://www.facebook.com/CommunityActio3/";;;;"x";"x";"x";"x";;;"http://cdn.firespring.com/images/ce278e42-d1d9-415e-93f6-0c7021b0486c.png";;;;;;;;
