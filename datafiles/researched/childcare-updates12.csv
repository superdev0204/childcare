Otsego is truly a family! OES is excited to continue PBIS this year. As a district, we officially rolled PBIS out during the school year. PBIS stands for Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports, and it is a framework for schools to provide consistent expectations across the building, common language the students understand, and instruction on how students are expected to behave. We are looking forward to continue improving our policies, procedures and routines to fully align with PBIS.";"https://elementary.otsegoknights.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=382105&type=d&pREC_ID=890401";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Otsego-Elementary/444200915650880";"https://www.otsegoknights.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=382491&type=d&pREC_ID=885061";"https://elementary.otsegoknights.org/apps/news/article/650876";"https://4.files.edl.io/84c5/07/09/18/154407-16a22958-89b6-4bb8-8d13-e1e91098683b.pdf";;;"x";"x";;;;"9AM - 3:20PM";"9AM - 3:20PM";"9AM - 3:20PM";"9AM - 3:20PM";"9AM - 3:20PM";"Closed";"Closed";
