Our environments are very home like. Unlike traditional child care settings, we mindfully removed lots of primary colors and plastic toys and have replaced these items with real experiences. Our curriculum revolves around relationship building with the whole family. We make discoveries based off of children's interests and document the child's learning to share with the family.
