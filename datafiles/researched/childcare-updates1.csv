As a committed mother of 4, I am very family oriented and blessed to have their love and support.  Prior to expanding into the center I ran Fun Place from my home for 12 years, where my reputation grew along with my waiting list.  I was encouraged to get licensed and open a center by many, and prepared to do so once my youngest Daughter was of school age. I obtained an associates degree in business and my education in early childhood development is ongoing. After being at home for 12 years I was excited to get back to work and expanded Fun Place in November of 2016.
