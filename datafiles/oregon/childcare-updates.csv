In addition, the range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each family's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

Serving western Arizona for over three decades, WACOG Head Start has a long tradition of delivering high quality services designed to enhance the healthy development of children. The primary focus of WACOG Head Start is children and their families. It is the program's mission to provide the foundation for the development of self-sufficient, healthy, caring and productive children and families. It is Head Start's role to ensure the provision of opportunities of parents to become active participants in their children's growth and development. Children's 'social competence' is an overall goal of the program and is defined as a child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with the responsibilities that attend both school life and home life. Social competence also takes into account a child's social, emotional, cognitive and physical development, and how these aspects are interrelated.

Since 1990, WACOG Head Start has more than quintupled its enrollment in its tri-county service area. The program is funded to serve 1,000 children and their families representing a diverse population in terms of culture, ethnicity, and language.

Speedway, just 6 blocks west of the University of Arizona. Our full-day program provides an enriched, language-based curriculum for young children ages 2-5. WOW aims to equip children with a strong foundation for learning. Because oral language skills are central to future success in reading, writing, self-esteem, and building relationships, WOW’s curriculum emphasizes oral language development. In addition to language-based classroom curriculum, students are provided with speech and language therapy as needed.

Weekly lesson plans at WOW are centered around themes that encourage children to learn about themselves, their families, their communities, and their world in visual, tactile, and auditory ways. Teachers form personal relationships with the children in their classrooms. Knowing the individual strengths and weaknesses of each child allows teachers to employ teaching techniques and learning activities that will best help that child grow.

Tuition payments by parents cover program participation. Fund-raising events sponsored by the Scottish Rite Charitable Foundation provide funding for speech and langauge services. State employee tuition discounts and income-based scholarships may be available.";"http://clctucson.org/services/wings-on-words-program";;;;"http://clctucson.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WOW-Program-Application.pdf";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://clctucson.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WOW-CLC-Logo-300x170.jpg";;;;;;

In addition, the range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each family's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

Serving western Arizona for over three decades, WACOG Head Start has a long tradition of delivering high quality services designed to enhance the healthy development of children. The primary focus of WACOG Head Start is children and their families. It is the program's mission to provide the foundation for the development of self-sufficient, healthy, caring and productive children and families. It is Head Start's role to ensure the provision of opportunities of parents to become active participants in their children's growth and development. Children's 'social competence' is an overall goal of the program and is defined as a child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with the responsibilities that attend both school life and home life. Social competence also takes into account a child's social, emotional, cognitive and physical development, and how these aspects are interrelated.

Since 1990, WACOG Head Start has more than quintupled its enrollment in its tri-county service area. The program is funded to serve 1,000 children and their families representing a diverse population in terms of culture, ethnicity, and language. The program has 20 centers with 42 classrooms and is staffed by over 130 full and part-time teaching staff.";"http://www.wacog.com/head_start_centers.html";;"8:00am to 5:00pm

The Program serves children zero to five years old who meet the required income guidelines.  NACOG uses several program options to provide Preschool and Early Head Start services in 28 Northern Arizona communities on behalf of 1613 children.

NACOG addresses the needs of enrolled children and families by using the Head Start Performance Standards and locally designed service delivery systems. The program utilizes a comprehensive approach in meeting the needs of enrolled children and provides them the opportunity to begin their school experience on equal footing with their more socially advantaged peers.  This is done with the use of field management zones and a network of service area partnerships that address the extreme rural barriers confronted by our large geographic area, extreme weather conditions, and the lack of resources.

BlocksOur main purpose is to meet the basic needs of each child (social, physical, emotional and intellectual) with love, integrity, generosity, self-discipline and hard work.

We celebrate your child as a unique and precious individual. Our staff is dedicated to providing a nurturing place where children can build a foundation for continued learning. We believe a feeling of self worth is one of the greatest attributes that we can instill in your little one. It is our desire to teach children values and skills for living: how to make good choices, work independently, display proper manners, how to take responsibility, sharing, empathy, caring honesty, and respect.

When you trust your child to the care of others, you need to know that this home away from home is the best you can provide. You need the peace of mind that comes from leaving your child in a clean, caring and educationally stimulating environment. And you need options that work with your schedule.

Our hands-on learning will foster social/emotional, physical and intellectual growth. Our highly qualified staff understands that students develop at different rates and therefore will nurture and grow the skills that your child will need for their future academic journey.

We also believe that children need to know the concept of a God who is loving, kind, patient and wise. While we gladly accept students of all faiths and heritages, it is important that children see and replicate Christian values such as loving one another, showing kindness without judgment, also accepting and understanding of differences in one another, to be peacemakers and to be compassionate. To this end, Peoria Presbyterian Preschool students will participate weekly in a 15 minute “chapel” experience which may include a Bible story and/or a religious song.

In addition to the ‘basics’, we offer students a range of gross motor and creative opportunities including weekly music classes, art workshops, and daily yoga. We strive to include enrichment activities that extend our students knowledge and understanding of the world outside the classroom including geography, zoology, botany, history, and science. Each year our older students take a field trip to the Phoenix Symphony, Celebrity Theater, or other local places of interest.

We are also committed to parent education. For interested parents, we offer a number of seminars throughout the year to help you better understand and support your children’s development.

We encourage children to explore the world while developing small and large muscle coordination, eye-hand coordination, language skills, a strong sense of self-esteem, and foster a positive Jewish identity.

We want children to experience a wide variety of activities including art, music, movement, water play, sensory play, manipulative play, stories, and quiet time. These activities will foster development of pre-math skills, pre-reading skills, and social skills, all of which will help to prepare children for their elementary school years. The curriculum encourages children to be actively involved in the learning process, to experience a variety of developmentally appropriate activities and materials, and to pursue their interests in the context of life in the Jewish community and the world. We combine teacher directed activities with ones in which teachers facilitate interactive play and child directed activities.

Our Jewish heritage is an essential part of our program since is provides a source of identity, a framework for interpreting the world, the basis for a feeling of belonging and our sense of values. We foster developmentally appropriate independence in children and use positive reinforcement techniques of guidance including redirection, anticipation, and elimination of potential problems, and encouragement. The Solel Preschool Staff strives to achieve these goals:

    Foster a positive self-concept.
    Foster a positive Jewish identity.
    Develop social skills.
    Encourage appropriate responses to discipline.
    Encourage children to think, reason, question, and experiment.
    Encourage language development.
    Enhance physical development and motor skills.
    Encourage creative expression.
    Encourage good health practices.

These goals allow our teachers to plan age-appropriate activities and set guidelines for meeting the learning and emotional needs of all children.";"http://www.solelpreschool.org/preschool/mooffanka/?start";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.solelpreschool.org/preschool/katytidSolel/pic/logo.gif";;;;;;

ANDREW'S PRESCHOOL & DAY CARE CENTER";"969 WEST COUNTRY CLUB DR.";"NOGALES";"AZ";85621;"SANTA CRUZ";"(520)281-0133";"http://www.standrewsaz.org/Preshool/preschool.htm";;"For many years members of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Nogales were concerned many of the children living in Santa Cruz County were entering public school lacking in skills and behaviors needed for success.

 In 1996, the St. Andrew’s Church Vestry decided to address this issue by opening a private educational facility which would be based upon the premise that a quality preschool and day care center would enhance the future academic success of children. This premise has been proven during the years the preschool has been in operation. The current program is bi-lingual, English is taught to the children who speak only Spanish and Spanish is taught to those who are English speaking. Recognition of letters, numerals, reading, writing and social skills are fundamental components of the curriculum.

The preschool is incorporated by the State of Arizona, has the IRS designation of a non-profit 501(c)3, and operates with a decision making Board of Directors made up of church, community members and preschool parents.

The preschool is housed in the former church rectory which has been completely renovated to become a child friendly, welcoming facility, meeting the Arizona Child Care License safety requirements.
The initial funding for the operating expense of the preschool came from interested church and community members, the Episcopal Charities Appeal of the Diocese of Arizona and the Southwest Regional Parish, a coalition of Episcopal churches located in the southwest portion of the Diocese. All donated funds and grants received each year from various community and charitable foundations are used for scholarships, equipment and operating expenses.

The preschool, licensed by the State of Arizona for 37children, usually has a “waiting list” illustrating the community’s interest in a quality preschool and day care program. Students who qualify and cannot afford tuition are granted scholarships. The tax deductible Scholarship Fund is supported by individuals, organizations and grants. The Arizona Department of Economic Security gives child care funding for D. E. S. approved families.
Quality education in a nurturing environment is the basic goal of St. Andrew’s Preschool & Day Care Center. This goal is accomplished through the efforts of a trained and caring staff. A teacher/student ratio of 1 teacher for every 10 children enhances success. At the time of the preschool spring “graduation” the children are truly bi-lingual, they recognize and write the alphabet and numerals, and demonstrate the social skills which are needed to help them succeed in public school. Many of the children are also able to read.

A non-denominational chapel is held each week. Taught by an ordained priest, children sing, learn prayers and hear Biblical stories which help to instill positive values for living.

The preschool is a member of NAES (The National Association of Episcopal Schools). The preschool is accredited with the National Association for Education of Young Children (NAEYC), and is the only nationally certified private preschool in Santa Cruz County. The school is participating in the Arizona Self Study Project with the Arizona Association for Supportive Child Care. The teachers have attended classes given by Central Arizona College and have earned School Age, Provider and Preschool Certificates. Three of the teachers are also nationally certified by NAEYC.";"http://www.standrewsaz.org/Preshool/preschool.htm";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.standrewsaz.org/images/GN_ecusa_logo.gif";;;;;;

It began about one year after the death of Sherie's husband, Dr. Gunnar Richardson, a pediatric dentist. Sherie,along with the help of family and many good friends, began the school so that she could continue to stay home with her own children (4 daughters) and still have an income.

Sherie received her AMI Montessori Training from Nimal Vaz in 1991 and was privileged to teach with Debbie Gardner during the first year and a half. Debbie passed away April 10, 1993.

During the fifth year of operation of Montessori House as a private preschool, Dave and Star Burba were referred to the school by Jim and Jamie Utic who had been bringing their children to the school. Dave and Star enrolled their daughter, Madison, in the Montessori House program and continued to bring her and then her brother, Dylan, until the present time.

In November, 1999, Sherie was going through some very difficult struggles financially and had made it a matter of serious fasting and prayer to determine if she should abandon Montessori House and seek employment elsewhere. During this time, she was made aware of a house owned by Marston and Sue Richards that would be perfect for a Montessori school. Mr. Richards is an architect and had designed the home for his family using the Frank Lloyd Wright style as a basis for his design. The house was built in 1972 . Sherie, having been in the house before and having attended a Montessori conference at Taliesan West a few years prior to this, and having met with Frank Lloyd Wright architects who drew up a Montessori School designed by Taliesan architects and attending Montessori teachers, knew that this house would truly be perfect for a Montessori school.

Coinciding with this experience, Sherie had attended a meeting at the Arizona State Dept. of Education Charter Board and been introduced to the method of obtaining a charter in the State of Arizona. Sherie approached Dave and Star Burba and asked if they would be able to help her with this huge undertaking. Dave, who is a pitcher with the Cleveland Indians is very generous and is supported in his generous donations by his wife, Star. There response was, ""Of course. We would love to help!"" and within a month, they purchased the property and procedures began to remodel the property for the school.

Mr. Richards continued to serve as the architect to present plans to the city many times. Jim Gardner, Jr. was hired as the general contractor. Vaughn Young Associates furnished interior design ideas. The charter was obtained in April 2000, for Montessori House, Inc. and after a long summer of meeting city zoning and building requirements, state and county regulations and spending tens of thousands of dollars, which has been so generously furnished by the Burba's, the school opened on September 11, 2000. In order to get to this opening date, a thousand doors were closed, but a thousand and one windows were opened. Many parents, friends, and neighbors participated by donating hundreds of hours of time to paint, scrape, haul, clean, and support this huge undertaking.

The beginning enrollment includes around 40 students in grades K-6 with the preschool (which is not part of the charter but part of the Montessori House Incorporation) enrollment of 29 children. Sherie Richardson, serves as the administrator.

All students, teachers, parents, and staff who are part of the beginning of this new school, and who will be a part of its future, are part of a dream-come-true and a vision realized. There is much to thank God for and much to look forward to.";"http://www.montessori-house.com/home";;"8:30 - 12:30";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.montessori-house.com/Portals/0/montessori-house-header.png";;;;;;

She was devoted to her children, Ernest Gaddie and Trudy Rhoton. Her devotion saw them through their formative years. She had a love of family and country, a passion for education, a sense of humor, and a generous heart. Her life and legacy remains a powerful example of goodness to her posterity.

Burke Basic School continues Mary Ann Burke’s legacy in nurturing children in character values and academic excellence. It is our passion to value the individual worth and potential of each student. It is our mission to see that each child feels loved, safe, and successful every day.

Our curriculum embraces the basic educational traditions and values of the 1800s. The reading materials we use were published in the mid-to-late 1800s. These books are not only more challenging than the current classroom publications, but also are rich with morals and patriotism.

Our standards of character and academic excellence are high. We expect each child to act with honor and give the greatest effort to academic achievement. It is our strong belief that we are not only developing tomorrow’s leaders, but more importantly, tomorrow’s husbands and wives, mothers and fathers.

We fully understand that we work for parents. It is the overall responsibility of the parent to educate their children in mind and morals. We are here to assist you. Our doors are always open to suggestions, critiques, complaints, and compliments. Please feel free and welcome to visit the school.

Thank you, for choosing Burke Basic School. We fully appreciate the seriousness of helping you educate your children.";"http://burkebasicschool.com/?page_id=116";;"8am-2:45pm";;"http://burkebasicschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Pre-Enrollment-Form-BBS.pdf";"http://burkebasicschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/handbook.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://burkebasicschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/logo1.jpg";;;;;;

In addition, the range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each family's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

Serving western Arizona for over three decades, WACOG Head Start has a long tradition of delivering high quality services designed to enhance the healthy development of children. The primary focus of WACOG Head Start is children and their families. It is the program's mission to provide the foundation for the development of self-sufficient, healthy, caring and productive children and families. It is Head Start's role to ensure the provision of opportunities of parents to become active participants in their children's growth and development. Children's 'social competence' is an overall goal of the program and is defined as a child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with the responsibilities that attend both school life and home life. Social competence also takes into account a child's social, emotional, cognitive and physical development, and how these aspects are interrelated.

Since 1990, WACOG Head Start has more than quintupled its enrollment in its tri-county service area. The program is funded to serve 1,000 children and their families representing a diverse population in terms of culture, ethnicity, and language. The program has 20 centers with 42 classrooms and is staffed by over 130 full and part-time teaching staff.";"http://www.wacog.com/head_start_centers.html";;"8:00am to 5:00pm

It can be difficult to imagine what your child will experience at a new preschool and kindergarten. You may ask questions like, What is their day going to be like? What will they learn? How will they learn? What is a Montessori Preschool? These are very important questions and on the mind of most all parents exploring new preschools. We would like to share with you a sneak peek into our Montessori Preschool and what you can expect your child to experience. We also welcome you to give us a call for a private viewing while class is in motion. You will sit with the children during a normal school day and experience in person how wonderful this learning process truly is.

A typical preschool day at Hope Montessori School begins on the playground. Preschoolers greet teachers and classmates and engage in free play until the bell rings, signaling time for a group lesson at our circle in the classroom. While joined at the circle preschoolers and kindergarteners are introduced to many new concepts that are currently being studied and lessons that lend themselves to a group presentation. This is also a time for discussing the day to day concepts like date, weather, and show and tell.

Once circle time is over the children, begin team and individualized work in the classroom. This is a time for teachers to introduce individualized lessons in math, language, geography and other materials according to the readiness of the individual child. The children spend most of this time working on material that has been presented previously to them. Our work days are primarily in the classroom learning and mastering new lessons while at times incorporating unique learning experiences such as gardening and nature exploration.

At the end of the day, we gather at the circle once again. We read our end of the day story and sing new songs, happy and fulfilled with a day of learning. Please continue reading for an in depth look into our Montessori teaching method.";"http://hopemontessori.info/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hope-Montessori-School/1422157584712412";;;"http://hopemontessori.info/enrollment/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://hopemontessori.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hope-montessori-school-preschool-kindergarden-e1416505054931.jpg";;;;;;

There is constant interaction, problem solving, child to child teaching, and socialization.

Children are challenged according to their ability and never bored. Our Montessori environment emphasizes learning through all five senses, not just through listening, watching, or reading.

In addition to the individual work time, each day’s lesson includes time for group activities, discussions, music, games, stories, drama, poetry, grace, and courtesy.

Learning is an exciting process of discovery, leading to concentration, motivation, self-discipline, and a love of learning.

Flagstaff Jr. Academy Children’s House is a multi-age classroom with students ages three through kindergarten. We truly believe this is the best foundation for all future learning. We will work to create a beautiful, safe, and stimulating environment for your children. We will form a community of caring, curious learners…and we’ll have fun!

Parents, do you want your child to know that God loves them, created them special in His own image and wants to be in their life forever? Then Preschool Ministry is the place for them to be - children all over agree!

Our Preschool Ministry partners with parents to train up a child in the way that they should go by teaching them basic Bible principles, singing to the Lord, playing games and creating unique crafts. We even send home a follow-up sheet to help you continue the learning at home!

We don't take the incredible privilege of shaping & molding young lives lightly.

You can rest assured knowing that your child is being well cared for and taught the word of God while you attend service. So relax and hear from God on Sunday morning.

Quality Interactive Montessori School encourages independent, self-directed learning for life in a child- centered environment, where children are seen, taught and appreciated for their individuality in a small group setting. We focus on respect for others; our environment and in ourselves while instilling a love of learning in each child.

Our Philosophy
Quality Interactive Montessori School was founded in 2004 to foster a love of learning and to educate children to be caring, socially responsible citizens of their community and world. The educational and supplemental care programs at QI involve children from 6 weeks of birth through grade 6 in five different programs: Infant, Toddler, Primary, Kindergarten and Elementary School. QI seeks to educate the whole child, applying the Montessori philosophy, in a family-oriented environment. The philosophy is based on the principles of Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952) whose holistic vision of education focuses on the cognitive, social, emotional and physical needs of the child. For Dr. Montessori, and for QI, education is preparation for life. ";"http://www.qimontessori.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/QIMontessori";"Mon - Fri:

In 1997 they transitioned their group home operation into Johnson 'N' Johnson Family Day Care Center at 3815 E Foothills Drive. In 2000 they opened their second center, Johnson 'N' Johnson Day Care Center South, at 3803 S Hwy 92. They are the proud parents of two grown children and five grandchildren.  Johnson 'N' Johnson Family Day Care Centers, LLC have a longstanding reputation for providing a nurturing environment for children. Nurturing environments include early education, which is a jump-start toward a more positive long term educational experience. Their philosophy that early childhood interventions and education should be available to every child is one of the reasons Johnson 'N' Johnson keeps childcare costs affordable.

Another core component of quality childcare is excellent nutrition. Mrs. Johnson established nutritional menus for breakfast, morning snack, lunch and afternoon snack. These meals meet nutritional standards set by the State of Arizona and the Child and Adult Care Food Program of which they are affiliated. All meals are included at no extra cost to the parents.

TDSP strives to create an educationally advanced Orthodox Jewish elementary school that offers single-gender classrooms starting from Kindergarten age.

The school will prepare students for the “bais medrash and the board room.” In other words, it will offer a superior Torah education and a superior secular education

The school will create an atmosphere that honors and respects students, teachers, and parents, and therefore fosters communal growth.

The school will be guided by halacha (Jewish law) and will seek to Mechanech (educate in a Torah fashion) its students to be strong, committed, observant Jews.

Torah Day School is welcoming of all Jewish children, regardless of background or affiliation. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, color, or religious affiliation.

There is a special form of energy present here in this moment at Desert Oasis—a kind of energy that can only be felt at a school campus when students, teachers, parents, administrators, bus drivers, aides, and volunteers all come together to launch the day.  When a school’s climate and culture are positive, safe, and supportive—as they are at Desert Oasis—this energy is electric, palpable, and it is laden with excitement and promise.  This energy propels learning at Desert Oasis.  This energy brings students to school and reduces absences.  (Well, this energy, and a principal who recognizes a classroom’s perfect attendance by “scaring” students and teachers—but more about that will come later.)  This energy brings students, parents, and community members out to Desert Oasis events in record numbers.  This same energy brings a dedicated group of Desert Oasis teachers and the principal together in a combined effort to explain to the Arizona Education Foundation, to educators across the state, and to the community at large exactly how this energy is being created—with the hopes that it will then be replicated elsewhere with similar success.  After all, given the right conditions and under the proper care, what starts as a simple seedling will one day grow into a garden.

 
Desert Oasis, whose seeds were planted in August of 2008, is the newer of the two elementary schools that comprise the Nadaburg Unified School District (USD). The district’s roots trace back to 1920, when W.H. Griffin donated land to the district so that a one-room, red schoolhouse could be built.  While Nadaburg USD has grown by leaps and bounds since then, the district honors its heritage by holding its school board meetings in the original little red schoolhouse.";"http://www.nadaburgsd.org/Domain/33";;"Monday-Friday

The first classes were taught by Aliza Bount, who, for health reasons, moved to Arizona from Illinois with her husband George and their three children. Classes were held in their adobe home, which was just south of what is now Civic Center Plaza and Second Street. Aliza Bount was paid $40 a month to teach the 8-10 students from the seven families who resided in Scottsdale at that time.

The District's first bond election was held May 1, 1909, with 13 citizens voting ""yes"" and zero citizens voting ""no."" The amount of the bond, $5,000, was used to build our first school, now known as the ""Little Red Schoolhouse."" This building, also known at the time as Coronado School, is a historic site on Scottsdale Mall and now the home of the Scottsdale Historical Society.

Today, the District covers 112 square miles. Our boundaries are not coterminous with city of Scottsdale boundaries. We serve most of the town of Paradise Valley and parts of Tempe and Phoenix in addition to most of Scottsdale. The District has about 25,668 students and 1,551 teachers.

Reid Traditional Schools was created by parents and teachers. Our schools respect the role of parents and value their participation. One of the cornerstones of the Reid schools is strong parental involvement and parental input in academic areas. Parents and faculty work together to create the caring, supportive environment in which students learn.

Reid Traditional Schools offers a back-to-basics, traditional education to Arizona elementary students. The first school in the Reid family is Reid Traditional Schools’ Valley Academy, founded in 1995. This award-winning school has consistently earned top ratings from the Arizona Department of Education and has maintained a waiting list of hundreds of children. We are pleased to be able to expand this educational opportunity to students at Reid Traditional Schools’ second campus, Painted Rock Academy.

Students at Reid Traditional Schools are held to a high standard of behavior. School uniforms help unite the student body. Through a continual emphasis on academic achievement, students earn self-esteem through genuine, individual achievement.";"http://paintedrockacademy.com/contact/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Reid-Traditional-Schools/292663904164594";"Hours:

La Paloma Academy is a tuition-FREE, not-for-profit school. This gives us an advantage over private schools, which can cost thousands of dollars each year.

La Paloma Academy centers on more than just academics. We follow the Arizona State Standards while simultaneously implementing a family values curriculum. Curriculum is purchased with the alignment of the standards in mind. Our students are taught about trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. The La Paloma Academy staff makes our students’ educational experience both entertaining and challenging at the same time Charter schools, like La Paloma Academy, are public schools. Charter schools must adhere to the same major laws and regulations as all other public schools.

The major difference between charter and public schools is that charter schools have the freedom to set their own rules with regard to curriculum and teaching styles. La Paloma Academy, like many charter schools, was designed to deliver programs tailored to educational excellence and the needs of the community it serves.

In addition, the range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each family's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

Serving western Arizona for over three decades, WACOG Head Start has a long tradition of delivering high quality services designed to enhance the healthy development of children. The primary focus of WACOG Head Start is children and their families. It is the program's mission to provide the foundation for the development of self-sufficient, healthy, caring and productive children and families. It is Head Start's role to ensure the provision of opportunities of parents to become active participants in their children's growth and development. Children's 'social competence' is an overall goal of the program and is defined as a child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with the responsibilities that attend both school life and home life. Social competence also takes into account a child's social, emotional, cognitive and physical development, and how these aspects are interrelated.

Since 1990, WACOG Head Start has more than quintupled its enrollment in its tri-county service area. The program is funded to serve 1,000 children and their families representing a diverse population in terms of culture, ethnicity, and language. The program has 20 centers with 42 classrooms and is staffed by over 130 full and part-time teaching staff.";"http://www.wacog.com/head_start_centers.html";;"8:00am to 5:00pm

Since that time the school has moved several times and grown in students. PCCS is comprised of teachers and students from various area churches. We enjoy supporting churches in the area.

 Payson Community Christian School is mission-based and teaches a Biblical World-view. There are no requirements for students to attend church or for families to make a statement of faith. Since we are a Christian school we do require daily Bible study and all of our classes incorporate Biblical curriculum. The school encourages students to attend a Bible believing church of their choice. Special attention is made and teachers agree to teach the Bible rather than specific denominational beliefs that may or may not be controversial. 

 All PCCS teachers from Kindergarten to High School are certified by the State of Arizona and are active in their local church. Specific teacher qualifications are listed on their respective teacher pages.

 Payson Community Christian School is the only Christian School in the Rim Country and is also known as Payson Christian School, PCCS, and Payson Christian Child Care (previous preschool & daycare center name).

    We believe the family is the primary component in the child’s life with the center being a supportive component and partner with the family.

The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) itself has a long history of education. We have our own college that exists solely for training pastors and teachers. Martin Luther College in New Ulm, Minnesota is an amalgamation of two WELS Colleges; Northwestern Lutheran College, founded in 1865, and Doctor Martin Luther College, founded in 1884.

Big Red Barn has a comprehensive curriculum that fosters an appreciation for agriculture’s contribution to society.

This whole child approach allows each child the opportunity for direct interaction with plants and animals while learning the important aspects of care and conservation of our world.  

Big Red Barn has a beautiful garden filled with fruits and vegetables sure to fill the curiosity and stomachs of your children. We believe that children should experience good old outside playtime complete with games, potato sack races, water play, tricycles, and hands on activities to develop confidence in physical capabilities. We embrace the concepts of discovery-based learning through play, sensory exploration, creative expression, and most importantly making friends and developing social skills.

In addition, the range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each family's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

Serving western Arizona for over three decades, WACOG Head Start has a long tradition of delivering high quality services designed to enhance the healthy development of children. The primary focus of WACOG Head Start is children and their families. It is the program's mission to provide the foundation for the development of self-sufficient, healthy, caring and productive children and families. It is Head Start's role to ensure the provision of opportunities of parents to become active participants in their children's growth and development. Children's 'social competence' is an overall goal of the program and is defined as a child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with the responsibilities that attend both school life and home life. Social competence also takes into account a child's social, emotional, cognitive and physical development, and how these aspects are interrelated.

Since 1990, WACOG Head Start has more than quintupled its enrollment in its tri-county service area. The program is funded to serve 1,000 children and their families representing a diverse population in terms of culture, ethnicity, and language. The program has 20 centers with 42 classrooms and is staffed by over 130 full and part-time teaching staff.";"http://www.wacog.com/head_start_centers.html";;"8:00am to 5:00pm

Rather than a one-­‐size-­‐fits-­‐all approach, we teach to the learning levels of each individual, setting goals to challenge and excite your child.

Our program is unique, in that we take pride in continually assessing our students at their individual learning levels.  Students are always challenged to move up to the next level in their educational journey.  Classes offer independent exploration, small group activities, and teacher-­‐guided learning.

The school serves students from preschool through grade 8 who live in a large rural area that includes Leupp, Tolani Lake, and parts of Flagstaff.  Class sizes are limited to allow for individual attention, and we have a waiting list each year. Families are encouraged to enroll students early to reserve a place.

The STAR School’s vision is to create a joyful learning community in which members develop the character, skills and attitudes for understanding themselves, living in balance, and serving all our relations.

STAR is the first all off-grid, solar and wind powered, charter school in the country. Sustainable living is a way of life intrinsic to the community which the school serves.  We promote self-reliance, alternative building methods, and energy sources such as solar and wind power.

We agree with the evidence that small community schools can deliver a superior education.  We have set out to be a model of how that can be done even in a community with few jobs, no public utilities, and high drop-out rates. We host workshops about our unique curriculum, sustainable living, place-based education, culturally responsive education, technology and the arts.  Contact us if you are interested in our workshops.

In addition, the range of Head Start services is responsive and appropriate to each family's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

Serving western Arizona for over three decades, WACOG Head Start has a long tradition of delivering high quality services designed to enhance the healthy development of children. The primary focus of WACOG Head Start is children and their families. It is the program's mission to provide the foundation for the development of self-sufficient, healthy, caring and productive children and families. It is Head Start's role to ensure the provision of opportunities of parents to become active participants in their children's growth and development. Children's 'social competence' is an overall goal of the program and is defined as a child's everyday effectiveness in dealing with the responsibilities that attend both school life and home life. Social competence also takes into account a child's social, emotional, cognitive and physical development, and how these aspects are interrelated.

Since 1990, WACOG Head Start has more than quintupled its enrollment in its tri-county service area. The program is funded to serve 1,000 children and their families representing a diverse population in terms of culture, ethnicity, and language. The program has 20 centers with 42 classrooms and is staffed by over 130 full and part-time teaching staff.";"http://www.wacog.com/head_start_centers.html";;"8:00am to 5:00pm

WVCS has over 130 students enrolled in grades K-8 not including our preschool classes. The school has 15 Christian teachers including specialty teachers for Spanish, music, physical education, art, and computers.
WVCS teachers are dedicated to providing students with a quality Christian education while developing Christian character and deepening each child’s love for Jesus.
We are fully accredited by the ACSI Regional Accreditation Commission.
In the quest for a quality school, accreditation is an indicator to parents that the organization values the education of children enough to pursue excellence in every aspect of its operation. ACSI accreditation, specifically, requires schools to perform a self-study evaluating every aspect of its program against national and international standards which represent best practice in the field.
More specifically, the school must document how they are cultivating student growth, both academically and spiritually, while maintaining the highest standards of school operation and faculty excellence. To this end, accreditation requires the school leadership and faculty to examine the impact of the school’s biblical vision and mission upon its programs and stated student outcomes as well as verifying it’s compliance with accepted educational practices and management.
The process of accreditation includes the following components:
Completion of a self-study, based on active participation and feedback from all staff members.
On-site verification of the self-study by trained peer-evaluators with expertise in education, instruction, administration, and school management.
Accreditation decision made upon review of the school’s self-study and visiting team report.
Submission of an annual report detailing the school’s ongoing commitment to continuous program improvement.
Renewal of accreditation every five years.
We are proud to announce the completion of the process accreditation and the ACSI Regional Accreditation Commission has granted West Valley Christian School accredited status.  Thank you for your prayers and support as we engaged in the accreditation process.  Many of you spoke with the visiting team during their time on campus and we appreciate your comments of confidence to the group.";"http://www.wvchristianschool.org/";;;"http://www.wvchristianschool.org/about/employment-opportunities.cfm";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

We help the child to acquire knowledge, skills and positive attitudes toward self and others.This will enable them to solve problems, think creatively, continue learning, and develop maximum potential for leading productive, fulfilling lives in a complex and changing society. 

We recognize that different children have different learning styles, rates of learning and developmental levels.  Therefore, the curriculum evolves from the interests and needs of the children.  It is our belief that in order to enhance the whole child they will need sensory, concrete, hands-on learning experiences.  To that end the classrooms are designed to nurture curiosity, exploration and investigation. We believe that children learn best when allowed to explore and arrive at answers and understand concepts through their own process of thinking. There is time for independent activity and cooperative efforts. 

A Child's Delight Too views childcare as an extension of home life. Parent involvement is desirable and, in fact, necessary in order to enhance the overall development of the young child.  We encourage parents to participate in a variety of ways, such as, bringing their talents and expertise to the classroom, serving on the Board of Directors, attending family activities, and, most importantly, providing insight into their child.  Because a child's self-esteem is very precious, staff are employed who like, respect, and enjoy children, and who delight in the milestones of development that takes place in the early years of life. Staff are encouraged and expected to participate in a variety of types of staff training, including classes, workshops, independent readings, in-services, etc. 
Interaction between staff and child is encouraged to foster problem solving and creativity.  Currently there are 15 individuals on staff.  In addition there are foster grandparents and  volunteers.    

A Child's Delight Too, Inc. opened in 1980 as a center.  The center is located in the Faribo West Mall and is licensed for 60 children (ages 6 weeks to 13 years).";"http://achildsdelighttoo.com/";;"Monday - Friday: 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM

The roots of Anew Dimension go back as far as 1969, when a childcare program was started in Joyce Church in South Minneapolis.  In 1991 we became a United Way agency funded by Success by Six. In 1992 Anew Dimension became a Strong Beginnings site for Hennepin County. In 1995, we purchased and renovated our current space at 1819 Minnehaha Avenue South.

In 2001 Anew Dimension built a theatre space within the center, to house a theatre arts program called ""Imagination Theatre"". The original stories and music developed for this space are designed to stimulate the imaginations of children, influence them positively in their moral and social development, and foster an early appreciation for all aspects of the arts.

Today the childcare program serves 78 children, while the theatre reaches thousands. Anew Dimension is touching children's lives throughout the metro area.";"http://www.anewdimension.net/";;"Monday - Friday

Since 1965, Head Start has been serving the needs of disadvantaged infants, children, and pregnant women across America.

Over 1400 children, from prenatal through age 5, are enrolled in Community Action’s programs each year throughout Ramsey County.  Options include full-day, half-day, therapeutic, and inclusion classrooms, and home-visiting programs.  Families who meet our eligibility requirements and families with children with special needs are encouraged to apply.

    The prenatal to age 3 program, Early Head Start, offers a home-based design for families. Early Head Start Home Visitors meet regularly with parents and children to nurture child development and parenting skills. Families who qualify for childcare assistance may also choose full-day, center-based enhanced childcare for children ages six weeks to five years.
    Head Start children between the ages of 3 to 5 attend center-based programming. Classes are offered in either half-day or full-day options at centers conveniently located throughout Ramsey County. Eight centers operate half-day classes, 4 days a week from September through late May. A full-day, full-year option is also available at the Bigelow Head Start Center, or through partnership contracts with community childcare facilities.

We believe the first five years of a child’s life are very important to forming the attitudes and traits which will carry with later in life. We teach Christian values where every child is upheld as a Child of God.

We are designed to provide excellence in the child’s social, emotional, physical, intellectual and spiritual development for infants, toddlers and preschool for success in life. We strive to balance the demands of work and family. We believe that children learn best through their play.  Our preschool program offers a kindergarten readiness standard that balance teacher directed and child initiated opportunities.

Our environment is warm and welcoming; children feel a sense of belonging.  We have a low teacher to child ratio; small groups within classrooms allow for more individual attention.  All our teachers are certified in Pediatric First Aid and CPR.  We are monitored by a registered nurse who visits us monthly for health and safety practices.

Our Center policies and practices support diversity among children, families, and staff. We encourage the acceptance of each person as an individual. The adults and children will help each other become aware of stereotypes and biases and work to eliminate them from relationships in our program.

Each group of children will have a certified teacher plus at least one teacher aid. Our teachers are professionals with a college degree and specific training in early childhood. They are able to promote the acceptance of ""self"" and others, encourage problem solving, communication, and provide a caring, consistent role model for young children. The child's teacher will be the main contact for the parents. However the directors are also available to confer with parents.

We also believe parents are an integral part of their child's program. Our goal is to have them involved in their child's activities, whenever possible. We encourage them to grow in their parenting skills through educational programs, interaction with professionals, and through sharing with other parents.

The program seeks to work with other university departments, students, and the community to meet the needs of the children enrolled and their families.

We cultivate intentional environments that nurture each child's social, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual development.

 

We begin with age-appropriate environments that encourage children to learn, play and explore. You name it -- books, blocks, puppets, paper, toys and tambourines, they are all here ready for your child to experience. There are sticks for counting, seeds for planting and places for exploring. Your young child will find an endless assortment of activities that engage their interest and stimulate their mind, heart, and hands.

 

At the heart of every project and activity, there are specially trained teachers and age-appropriate curriculum to lead the way.  Your child will benefit from the exceptional staff of teachers at Small World School.  They are caring, intentional, artful and highly experienced. They are gifted at identifying and nurturing your child's gifts, abilities, and unique personality.

 

Children learn differently than adults.  They need hands-on experiences and teachers that are actively engaged and participate with them. Children need warmth and attention. They need enthusiasm and encouragement.

We learn through play!  What better way to educate children than through play?  Our hands on approach to early childhood education provides the children the opportunity to develop emotionally, intellectually, socially, spiritually, and physically - at their own pace. Through a positive learning environment, children grow to feel good about themselves and others. This allows their attitudes, skills, and curiosities to expand and grow, just as they do. Group cooperation, concern for others and responsible behavior are all concepts we encourage among the children.

Epiphany Preschool welcomes children ages 3 through 5. Our program is licensed by the Minnesota Department of Human Services to serve 20 children per session with one lead teacher and one assistant. Enrollment is filled on a first-come-first serve basis of registration.

The school curriculum introduces children to the joy of learning at their own pace and provides a framework in which intellectual and social discipline go hand in hand. 

We believe in a well-rounded program for your child. Children need opportunities to learn as well as to play games, be social, engage in make-believe, joke with friends, explore nature, sing, dance, draw, build, and just daydream.

Our overall goal is to provide early learning experiences that assist parents in nurturing the spiritual, physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development of their young children.  We believe this goal can be reached through hands-on, active experiences that are developmentally appropriate for young children. We further believe children develop best when all experiences occur in an atmosphere of Christian love and respect.

In October 2013 we moved into a new Center that will includes two preschool classrooms, an infant and toddler room, art studio, movement room, and college classroom.   Our programs are currently full but please call or e-mail for future enrollment information.

It started with 14 children and two classrooms. It was operated by four employees from the former Children's House which closed in the spring of 1986. The Montessori preschool and the Early preschool room were the two programs that started Apple Lane. The four co-directors were responsible for the decision making and planning of the program. Rent was paid to St. Edward's Catholic Church for the use of their facilities. The Church provided the child care center with insurance and did the building maintenance. Through the years the center grew to a licensed capacity of 60 children, 12 staff, and five classrooms. In the spring, 1997, the St. Edward's Church Board of Directors decided that it was not a priority for the Church to ""be in the day care business"" and negotiations ensued with the staff at Apple Lane. After negotiations, it was a very resound group decision among the staff and directors at the time that the child care operations remain open to continue to provide care for the 109 children served on a part-time, limited drop-in, summer care, and full-time basis from 97 families who attended Apple Lane of St. Edward's. The newly formed non-profit agency, Apple Lane Community Child Care Center, was created on October 29, 1997. In January 2006, Apple Lane expanded opened a second location at Riverland College. This site offers child care services to 52 children ages 6 weeks through age 5. This decision was made based on the need for toddler and infant care as well as the prevelant waiting list for preschool age children.

Over 1400 children, from prenatal through age 5, are enrolled in Community Action’s programs each year throughout Ramsey County.  Options include full-day, half-day, therapeutic, and inclusion classrooms, and home-visiting programs.  Families who meet our eligibility requirements and families with children with special needs are encouraged to apply.

    The prenatal to age 3 program, Early Head Start, offers a home-based design for families. Early Head Start Home Visitors meet regularly with parents and children to nurture child development and parenting skills. Families who qualify for childcare assistance may also choose full-day, center-based enhanced childcare for children ages six weeks to five years.
    Head Start children between the ages of 3 to 5 attend center-based programming. Classes are offered in either half-day or full-day options at centers conveniently located throughout Ramsey County. Eight centers operate half-day classes, 4 days a week from September through late May. A full-day, full-year option is also available at the Bigelow Head Start Center, or through partnership contracts with community childcare facilities.

The YWCA has partnered with Head Start since 2005, offering Head Start and Early Head Start services that monitor health, growth, learning and developmental milestones to income eligible families. The YWCA also collaborates with Early Childhood Family Education to provide support to parents with children in the YWCA Center. In the fall of 2011 we started a new project called Circles of Security with parents and caregivers at our Center. Focused on attachment theory and research, it works with the parents and child-care staff to give them new skills and tools to provide quality care and parenting. Successful attachment is the basis of future emotional and mental health in children and affects every aspect of their lives including the ability to learn.

Our program is unique. Lit'l Sprouts strives to give your child the best opportunities in learning. We strive to meet the core competencies standards for Early Childhood Education set forth by the Minnesota Association for Education of Young Children (MnAEYC). These standards are designed as a framework for understanding and learning for young children. Throughout the day, children are taught and are able to participate in fun ""hands-on"" activities and learning games, which shape, but are not limited to their intellectual, physical, social, or emotional development on a daily basis. From Infant to School Age, our staff has age-appropriate weekly lesson plans designed to be within the abilities of the child, yet challenge's their creative talents and imagination. Individuality is encouraged, as our goal is to help children within this diverse community understand and develop as well-rounded individuals. Our curriculum we use is Creative Curriculum. This curriculum allows for teachers to assess children's progress, individualize or adapt learning when necessary, and is used as a guide for our teachers' development and implementation of learning opportunities which are consistent with the program's goals and objectives. Curriculum is implemented in a manner that is reflective to the responsiveness of each family home values, beliefs, and experiences and language. Our day is fairly structured in nature. This is to help prepare and give children the school readiness skills they will need for the early years of schooling. Variances can arise occasionally to accommodate the changing needs and interests of the class and will be noted on lesson plans. A weekly lesson plan will be posted in each classroom, and is in your child's daily file so you and your child can engage in conversation about their day and most importantly skills learned!";"http://www.litl-sprouts.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Litl-Sprouts-Childcare-Center/157442194305442";"Mon - Fri

God commands us to raise our children properly:  ""Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it."" Proverbs 22:6

The members of Gloria Dei Lutheran Church feel strongly about the importance of providing that Christ centered academic foundation to nurture our children spiritually, mentally, and physically.  We also felt that many in our community would be interested in a Christian academy, where their children would be raised in God’s Word, “to the Glory of God”.  Out of this need arose Dei Spring Academy. 

After much praying, planning, and plenty of hard work; our preschool opened on September 4th, 2007 with one student.  The Lord has since blessed us with more students and an additional child care center. 

A little bit about our name…  Zachariah spoke these words at the naming of his son, John the Baptist:  “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us; to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”  (Luke 1:76-79)  Dei is the Latin word for God, which comes from the name of our church Gloria Dei: to the glory of God.  Spring comes from our location, Cold Spring, Minnesota.  We chose the name both to indicate a connection to our church and a connection to our community.  We also chose the name Academy to depict our willingness to educate our children according to the highest standards of traditional learning and methodology. 

 A little bit about our logo… The cross of Christ is the center of our crown of life.  Through Him, we raise daily in His love.  From Luke 10: 41-42:  “Jesus answered and said to her, ‘Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.  But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.’”  We learn from this that there is one thing more important than anything else:  Knowing Jesus as our Savior from sin and death.

The main goal is to produce successful and ready for school better yet ready for life children that will surpass their expectations in every step they take.  We are committed to each and every one of those children to become very successful in life early on, therefore we strive the way their brain is stimulated for the time that they are with us at the academy and we hope to teach them how to retain and use that knowledge throughtout their life.

We have many different programs that the children make very busy throughtout the day.  For the school age we have quran memorization,  islamic education, lecture giving, math, social studies, history and other brain development discussions.  They take pride in participating in all and they are very eagar to attend each and every class that they attend.  They are always hungry for more for the informations presented to them and they all eagerly participate in the question and answer sessions.

It teaches them how to be a leader in the community that they live in.  It teaches them to respect themselves and to respect others and finally and most importantly it teaches them to be humble no matter how much knowledge they have.

We also have preschool children that are as eagar as their predecessors.  The programs that we present to our preschool is of course little different from the ones presented to our school age children.  Even though we try to follow a miniture of the school age program, it is little flexible and is governned by their age, meaning age appropriate.

The curiculum for our preschool children also includes quran memorization, islamic education, history, fine motor skills, painting, beginning arabic language, math, intensive one on one english reading program, beginning somali language speaking, art, music, story telling, and other brain stimulating games. Both visual and audio media is utilized in their program to facilitate their learning process.

We have two english programs that we utilize and introduce to our preschool children.  One is Hooked on phonics and the other is my child can read.  Both programs are followed throughly to give maximum brain retention to increase the learnng curve for the child.  The result of those combined programs and the commitment and tireless effort of their teachers have produced many success in our preschool program and can be seen on the number of kids that can read both arabic and english by age five in a second grade level.

For our toddler program, we have age appropriate learning, even though they also are introduced to my baby can read program, their teachers mostly concentrate on how to make them ready for the task ahead of them in preschool.  We focus in teaching them alphabet letters and beginning letter recognition both in english and arabic, fine motor skills, painting, story telling, etc.  Both visual and audio media is utilized in their program to facilitate their learning process.

For our infants, they are the luckiest of all, as they have the most caring parents as care takers that are hand selected for them.  For their commitment in caring our infants, they make sure that infants have the best environment that are closest to home if not better when it comes to caring.  At the infant room, they are introduced in story telling, languages both english and somali, differen t objects are introduced to them for touch and feel, etc. They have the most human interaction in all programs as needed in their developing brain.

In addition to commiting to our children’s learning process, we also strive to encourage and educate their parents that participate in parents as care takers program by giving them fifty percent scholarships of getting their child development certificate and we left the other fifty percent for their responsibility so they can commit the program and follow through it untill they get their certiificate from the state.  These combined efforts create a community that are eagar to learn all the time and professional parents as care takers as they are learning not only from their CDA class but also from educated administration that are willing to build its community to produce a healthy functioning individuals to raise a healthy functioning children to become leaders for tomorrow in every community they happenn to live in.

It is and evnironment of learning that is desciplined and fruitfull.

We follow the best way of life.  Alxamdulillaah.";"https://madinaacademy.wordpress.com/about/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Each skill is broken down into small components, which are taught in a child-friendly, hands-on way. Children use the Montessori materials to build a concrete understanding of each skill. Individualized lessons and continued practice create a mastery of knowledge and a strong foundation toward higher-level thinking.

Unlike traditional education, the Montessori approach is toward mastery and not a set curriculum, within a set time. In Montessori, when a child is developmentally ready, they advance to the next level of learning. No child is forced ahead or held behind within a group lesson. This is why it is not uncommon for three year-olds to become readers, and 4 and 5 year-olds to develop math skills beyond traditional expectations. A true Montessori program is multi-age. Children between the ages of two-and-a-half to six-and-a-half all share the same learning environment. In the mixed-age setting, the children learn from one another.  Younger children get a preview of future work by watching the older children.  Older children reinforce their knowledge by sharing it with younger children. All the children learn to work with others of different ages and abilities, to respect each other’s work, and to treat each other with courtesy.

 God’s Young Minds Preschool also offers activities and interactions that promote social, intellectual, emotional and physical development.

Demand for daycare facilities continue to grow day by day, but all too often, institutions are only able to focus on either allowing the child to enjoy their childhood and develop naturally or forcing the child to focus only on mental development in order to achieve high test scores later on in life.

 

brightstar childcare center is different. We promote physical activities in large open areas and a wide variety of educational games, but we also have a small library and various arts and crafts for your child to unleash his or her full creative and intellectual potential.

We believe that children learn a second language best through immersion. We work with our teachers to eliminate English in the classroom. Our curriculum focuses not only on the skill development of the children, but also intentionally works to teach the language.

Healthy Foods Matter

We believe that the food we put into our bodies is important - much more so for growing little bodies! Our snacks contain no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup and are often organic. The milk we serve is rBGH-free. Our lunches are catered and don't provide as much control over the ingredients but we are actively working towards this goal.

Teacher and Child Bonding

We believe that children learn best when they feel safe and loved. We pay special attention to ensure that children develop a bond with their teacher throughout the year. Children are placed with one primary teacher for the entire school year. We are careful with our hiring decisions to ensure our staff believe in our mission. Then we do our best to provide an environment that makes people want to stay. If a teacher decides to resign, we ask that it is done only at the end of the school year.

Reusing Resources

We believe that it is important to support the communities where we are located. One way we contribute is by choosing to use existing community spaces. Our facilities may not be the newest and most fashionable but that is a conscious choice. We want to be in the community and bring life to older buildings (like churches) that would otherwise be sitting empty during the week.

The rooms are divided into learning centers where children are encouraged to explore, create, inquire, and respond at their own level. Their environment is structured to provide activities for language development, manipulation of materials, developing routines and work habits, and expressing feelings and ideas. The children are grouped according to their developmental age, which enables the child to grow among his/her peers.

In 2000, we were able to purchase our building in the heart of Highland Park.
The building was renovated and an amazing environment for children was created.
Our classrooms are filled with natural light, neutral colors and engaging materials.
The outdoor play space includes a Children’s Garden and gazebo.
Children can chase butterflies, grow beans and carrots,
run with rainbow streamers through garden paths and develop a love of nature.
RESPECT for ourselves, our friends and our environment, is the cornerstone of
The Little School’s philosophy.

We pride ourselves on our low teacher/child ratios,
creative curriculum and the ability to see each child as a gift.

Each day the children fill our hearts with laughter and joy.

We accomplish this by providing warmth and nurturing in a growth-facilitating environment rich with opportunities to learn and discover. 

 

Our goal is to provide parents with an open, welcoming atmosphere to encourage and promote parent involvement and parent peace of mind.  We work to develop a one-to-one relationship with each child and parent, communicating to the child that they are ""cared about"" as well as ""cared for"".  We accomplish this by providing the best suited staff; qualified and dedicated to understanding the needs of the children and families.

Further, we seek to extend the children's environment beyond the classroom and into the community.
We are committed to advocating for all children, reaching out into the community and the state to advocate for high quality care for all families.

Students consistently score at least one grade level above the average student on standardized tests.

But Hood View isn’t just about academics. At HVJA, the staff creates a safe environment where each student will be encouraged to have a personal relationship with God and positive relationships with others. HVJA nurtures a healthy self image and teaches students to make healthy choices.

Hood View implements Love and Logic into all of our classrooms. This approach to teaching empowers students to think for themselves and prepares them to function effectively in a society filled with temptations, decisions, and consequences. It also raises the level of student responsibility, while treating each student with respect and dignity.

We pride ourselves on a ‘family feel’ environment: safe, nurturing and character building. Our small class size and caring teachers are examples of what we stand for at Hood View Junior Academy: Preparing People for a Christ-Centered Life…one child at a time.

We provide a loving Christian environment with emphasis on the developmental stages of the child. At Bethlehem Christian Pre-School we desire to provide activities that are age-appropriate and nurture the spiritual, physical, mental and social development of each child. We believe children learn as they play. Learning for children takes place when information is meaningful, and is in the context of their experiences and development. Therefore, children learn best when provided with a variety of stimulating experiences in which they may freely interact. Our Early Childhood Education program is designed to support and extend young children's learning through direct experiences. Children learn when actively engaged, so we provide a balance of teacher-directed and child-initiated activities. Bethlehem Christian Pre-School is non-denominational in nature. Jesus Christ is central to our faith and philosophy. Our Christian beliefs are best represented by the Apostle's Creed. Throughout the year we talk about how God created the world and us, and that He loves us and sent Jesus to us. At this level we pray together and learn Bible Stories with puppets, flannel graphs, dramatization and other play props.

For nearly 40 years the center has served the local community, as literally thousands of children have passed through our doors.

    Our aim is to provide a warm, safe place for children where they can grow socially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. We believe that a child’s self worth develops as they learn to be responsible for their actions and are shown respect and love.
    Our trained and experienced staff helps your child learn by providing opportunities that encourage creativity and growth. They are here because they love children!
    Snoopeeland is NOT a baby-sitting service, nor are we a substitute for the family home. Rather, we want to support and come alongside the families we serve to provide a safe, wholesome environment away from home.
    In order to provide a well-rounded education, Snoopeeland features Bible stories in weekly chapel services as part of the learning experience. No reference is made to specific doctrines.
    Our purpose and vision is centered around Snoopeeland’s ministry to the community. We are a Christian center, and while our staff is not required to profess a Christian stand, we expect them to follow the moral and ethical teachings of Jesus. Staff is selected with attention to qualifications, training, abilities, and moral and ethical standards.
    As Snoopeeland is a ministry of Sunset Park Community Church, all the resources of the church are open to center families, including classes, activities, pastoral services, etc. For more information, contact Donna in the church office at 503-397-0535 or ask at the Snoopeeland office.

The organization was a parent membership with a parent Board of Directors. In 1994, the school purchased the building at its present site. In 1995, members of the larger community were invited to join the board, and many changes began to take place. The school hired a full-time director in 1996, and in 1997 the building was remodeled and an elementary classroom was added to the program.

Our activities stimulate children’s physical and intellectual development and foster social and emotional growth. Our program seeks to encourage children to think, reason, question and experiment. Through hands-on activities and challenges, the children become willing participants in their own learning cognitively, emotionally, socially, physically and culturally.

When you entrust the care and early education of your child to us, you can expect that the principles guiding that care are rooted in manifesting the following goals cited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC):

Relationships: That interactions between children and adults provide opportunities for children to develop an understanding of self and others and are characterized by warmth, personal respect, individuality, positive support and responsiveness. Our teachers facilitate interactions among children to provide opportunities for the development of self-esteem, social competence and intellectual growth.

Curriculum: That our curriculum implementation “reflects the knowledge that young children are active learners, drawing on direct physical and social experience as well as culturally transmitted knowledge to construct their understanding of the world around them.” Program quality is enhanced when “the curriculum encourages children to be actively involved in the learning process, to experience a variety of developmentally appropriate activities and materials. Young children learn through active manipulation of the environment and concrete experiences that contribute to concept development.”

Partnership: That teachers and families work closely in partnership to ensure high-quality care and education for children, and parents feel supported and welcomed as observers and contributors to the program. We believe in empowering parents by involving them in ongoing relationships as full partners with teachers in supporting their child’s development. “Young children are integrally connected to their families. Programs cannot adequately meet the needs of children unless they also recognize the importance of the child’s family and establish positive relationships with families based on mutual trust and respect. All communication between programs and families should be two-way, but also based on the concept that parents are and should be the principal influence in their children’s lives.”

At Joyful Noise Child Development Centers we plan activities that encourage cooperation, experimentation, and communication among children. We do not force children to operate as a large group for long periods of time. Instead we encourage children to let their curiosity and initiative drive them to make choices from a variety of classroom activities. Our teachers act as guides for these explorations, and investigators along side the children. Our Emergent Curriculum and extensive Projects speak to the children’s individual interests and allow learning within a meaningful context. The children in our centers learn to negotiate, solve problems, and construct their own code of ethics; thereby learning true compassion and developing intrinsically motivated empathy.

Parents who choose such developmentally appropriate environments for their children give them a much greater gift than any rote math or phonics lesson can. Combine this with stability, interaction, communication, and love, within the context of firm boundaries, and their children will have the foundations for successful future learning.

St. James Child Development Center was established in 1981. Our childcare center provides a safe and secure environment for over 120 children ages six weeks through kindergarten. We are committed to providing a fun-filled, rewarding program that balances each child's intellectual, physical, social, creative and emotional needs. 
Children are encouraged to be involved with the environment and learn from it. Teachers work to provide an ever changing and wide variety of activities within this setting. At each age level, themes ignite curiosity and allow children to explore their many talents. They spend their day immersed in a variety of activities that include art, music and movement, science, language, literature, and large and fine motor activities. Through all activities we seek to help the children develop self-confidence, strong academic skills and learn how to work together as a community. 
We are very proud of our program and our teachers. Our goal is to provide an environment that is safe, caring, and full of the wonder of discovery!

After six years as a Certified Professional Nanny, having her own child, and braving the daycare search herself, Brandi Webber became convinced she could create a better source of child care, right in her own community. During her search, she would find a place that appeared clean, organized and well-staffed but lacked that warm, nurturing quality that every newborn needs. Or another facility would appear nurturing and friendly, but fall short of providing the clean environment and cognitive stimulation that she also felt was important. Outrageous prices for care were also an obstacle. With over ten years of child care experience, Brandi Webber decided to take matters into her own hands and, in 2001, created Imagination Station Daycare Center in her own home. Shortly after opening, Imagination Station filled up quickly, expanding in the summer of 2006. Imagination Station continues to grow, providing many families in the North Portland community with reliable, affordable, top-notch professional child care.";"http://www.imaginationstationdaycarecenter.com/contact.html";;;;"http://www.imaginationstationdaycarecenter.com/enroll.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Standing firmly on that foundation we hold to a number of guiding principles as we fulfill our mission to educate students in the truth of God's word in every area of instruction and activity, so that their lives may be transformed by the renewing of their minds:

Independent - PCS is an autonomous, self-governing school system, receiving no funds or managerial oversight from any denomination or governmental agency. PCS is governed in its policies and administration by a Constitution which was adopted at the inception of the school. Policy is developed by the PCS Board of Trustees which consists of school parents elected by the Society (school parents). Administration is managed by the Superintendent, who oversees all operations and is accountable to the Board of Trustees.

Non-denominational - PCS is not associated with any church or denomination. With over 100 different congregations represented among our students and staff, we honor and celebrate diversity within the many Christian faith traditions.

Biblically based - At PCS we take the Bible seriously and incorporate biblical principles into every class. We strive to help our students develop critical thinking skills from a biblical perspective.

Excellence - Our standard is excellence in every area -- academics, athletics, arts...and life! Excellence may mean earning an ""A"" in a class, but it may also mean receiving a ""C"" that was earned with blood, sweat, and tears. Excellence may mean winning a championship, but it may also mean losing with grace and sportsmanship. Excellence may mean putting on a star performance, but it may also mean supporting your colleagues who falter. At PCS, excellence is about not only performance, but also character, and faith.";"http://pcschools.org/content/contact-us";;"8am-3pm";"http://pcschools.org/content/employment";"http://pcschools.org/content/admissions-0";"http://pcschools.org/sites/default/files/files/ECE%20Elem_%2014-15%20Handbook.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

SJB students are confident, creative and connected in faith. Our warm, caring atmosphere combines with a rigorous curriculum to inspire a dynamic community dedicated to the development of each individual child.

The academic program at St. John the Baptist Catholic School provides a rich, comprehensive learning experience. In addition to the core curriculum, students participate in Spanish, Music, Physical Education, and Library classes. The first Apple Distinguished School in Oregon, SJB incorporates technology on a one-to-one basis starting in Kindergarten!

The caring community composed of dedicated teachers, parents, and students cultivates a climate of respect and kindness. Optimal class sizes permit teachers the opportunity to meet the individual needs of each student. Parents appreciate the way that teachers both encourage and care for their students. They sense the balance between high standards and grace. All students participate in community service opportunities and are challenged to grow both intellectually and spiritually.

What do students have to say about SJB? Recently, a group of Middle School students shared their thoughts on what makes our school special:

""It's a safe, supportive, and caring place.""

""Teachers give us extra time and attention.""

""Classmates are like brothers and sisters.""

Our intergenerational program is one of the first of its kind in the state of Oregon and has been a place for generations to learn and grow together since 1985. Unique to our program is the opportunity for your child to build relationships with seniors as they engage in special daily activities. It is truly a relationship to be treasured.   At Willson House Child Development Center you will find children and seniors interacting daily. Children and seniors will be together singing songs, telling stories, making crafts or participating in annual events like our Tea Party or Carnival. Seniors also frequent our classrooms to say hello, lead projects, or serve as volunteers. No matter what the interaction may be, the young and young at heart will be learning and growing, together.

As a mother of three, Nancy noticed the importance of providing childcare that felt personal and a place where parents were comfortable leaving their children. As her business grew, Mueller opened her first center in 2000 in the Westgate Shopping Center. She then moved her business across the street to a building she had specifically built for her center in 2005. Most recently, she opened a toddler center next to Annette’s Restaurant in West Salem in 2008. Parents and families keep coming back to WSKC as it provides quality childcare in a homey atmosphere.
 

Today, West Salem Kids Care (WSKC) prides itself in being affordable, engaging and a welcoming environment for children and their families. WSKC offers year round care for ages two to twelve years of age. We’d be more than happy to offer you a tour, feel free to give us a call today!

Children are encouraged to develop self-discipline and a respect for others.  We maintain a nonsexist, non-racist setting for children's learning.  We believe it is important to enhance the development of a positive self-image in each child.  We accomplish this by providing warmth and nurturing in a growth-facilitating environment rich with opportunities to learn and discover. 

 

Our goal is to provide parents with an open, welcoming atmosphere to encourage and promote parent involvement and parent peace of mind.  We work to develop a one-to-one relationship with each child and parent, communicating to the child that they are ""cared about"" as well as ""cared for"".  We accomplish this by providing the best suited staff; qualified and dedicated to understanding the needs of the children and families.

Further, we seek to extend the children's environment beyond the classroom and into the community.
We are committed to advocating for all children, reaching out into the community and the state to advocate for high quality care for all families.

Parkside Community Preschool (known as Child Care Inc. until 2002), is a community based, 501 (c) (3) non-profit preschool and has been providing high quality care since 1967.  In 2004, we moved into a new facility built especially for children! 

Our bright and cheery school provides nurturing and developmentally appropriate care and education to children from ages 3 months to 6 years. 

Our classrooms include an Infant Room, Toddler Room, Preschool Room, and Pre K Room.  Age and developmental stage determine which room best meets the needs of your child.

With tuition based on a sliding scale, flexible scheduling, parent education, family support services, and a developmentally appropriate program geared toward children’s individual needs, we are unique and vital to the community. 

We nurture the growth and healthy development of each child, providing them with the opportunity to succeed.  We have been located in the Whiteaker neighborhood of Eugene, Oregon since 1967 and are the longest continuously running child care program in Lane County.

Since 1994, the Family Relief Nursery has been serving families in the greater Cottage Grove area. In 1993, members of the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs of Cottage Grove, Cottage Grove Healthcare Community, Relief Nursery of Eugene, local social service agencies, churches and community business leaders responded to two horrific cases of child abuse to bring Relief Nursery services to South Lane and North Douglas Counties. The Family Relief Nursery began serving children in August of 1994. Since then, hundreds of children and their families have received family strengthening services.

Substantial contributions from the Woodard Family Foundation, the Doyle & Donna Shepherd Foundation, Meyer Memorial Trust, Ford Family Foundation, Oregon Community Foundation, Siuslaw Valley Bank, US Bank, and the McKay Foundation were instrumental in building our permanent site which opened its doors in 1997. Continued financial support form the State of Oregon, Oregon Early Learning Council, Lane Country Commission on Children and Families, City of Cottage Grove, Cottage Grove Rotary Club, Children’s Trust Fund of Oregon and numerous local businesses and individual donors.

Our program is designed to address the whole child. It meets the needs, extends the interests, and provides for individual abilities at each developmental level. We are dedicated to creating a safe and stimulating environment where children can play, learn and laugh together. Our teachers help children grow and develop by using patience, love, and understanding – and we instill a strong sense of self-esteem and competence by nurturing each child. This developmentally appropriate approach offers each child the opportunity to:

    Develop a positive self-image by learning self-control, handling self-direction, and exploring independence within the guidelines of a safe and loving environment.
    Develop intellectually through specifically planned activities that will orient him/her to pre-academic skills in social interaction, reading, math and science.
    Develop fine and gross motor skills with daily activities that encourage the use of large and small muscles.

Activities at the center are geared to enrichment; those that will help a child develop socially, emotionally, mentally and physically while permitting them to achieve the independence they need.

We have 2 different locations to better serve our local community.  The first location 1901 Pierce Street, began in June of 1997.  This location is a State Certified Child Care Group Home with a total of 16 children serving ages 2 to 6 years.

The second location is at 5310 Fox Hollow Road and is a State Certified Child Care Center serving 56 children from 8 weeks to 6 years in the lower building, and the upper building will provide before school and after school educational care for children 6 to 12 years of age.";"http://www.rainbowgardenschool.org/rainbow-garden-school/";;"6:30 am to 6:30 pm, Monday through Friday";;"http://www.rainbowgardenschool.org/contact-us/application/";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://x1k.net/one/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/logo.png";;;;;;

We are committed to providing safety and security for all children. Foresight Learning Center encourages learning and growth through play in an environment designed so that children may strengthen muscles, build coordination, stretch their imaginations, and have fun.

 We believe that children should be allowed to grow at their own pace, and to learn in ways that help them become confident in themselves as learners. Our goal is to provide all of the children with a clean, safe, comfortable, and nurturing environment. Respect toward self, others and the environment will be emphasized. We believe in the value of both structured and non-structured activities. Structured activities will include the use of a preschool curriculum, regular reading times, circle times, arts and crafts, and musical activities. Outdoor play and center times are some of the more flexible activities we have. It is our goal to create an environment and program where the child’s natural desire to learn is stimulated through meaningful, appropriate, and playful learning experiences, one that meets the needs of each child as an individual.

 Another overlooked, yet crucial part of the learning process is the atmosphere of the educational facility. Children are VERY sensitive to the textures and sounds of their surroundings. We strive to showcase our students work and creations, and have lots of educational materials for them to gaze at. Many factors contribute to a welcoming atmosphere, such as:

 Lighting- Our facility has a well balanced mix of natural and artificial light. Shades are left open during the day so that the children don’t feel like they are trapped in a dark room all day.

Music- Background music makes all the difference in the world! At Foresight Kids music is a crucial fiber of our day. Sounds stimulate children in many different ways. We like to play lots of educational songs so that they are learning while they are singing.

Textures- Surrounding our facility we have pillows and blankets for the children to use at any time they would like. Children are especially sensitive to textures and we aim to make them as comfortable as possible!

Happy Staff- Making sure our staff is happy will result in happy kids and the eagerness to learn, develop, and grow.

We accomplish this by providing warmth and nurturing in a growth-facilitating environment rich with opportunities to learn and discover. 

 

Our goal is to provide parents with an open, welcoming atmosphere to encourage and promote parent involvement and parent peace of mind.  We work to develop a one-to-one relationship with each child and parent, communicating to the child that they are ""cared about"" as well as ""cared for"".  We accomplish this by providing the best suited staff; qualified and dedicated to understanding the needs of the children and families.

Further, we seek to extend the children's environment beyond the classroom and into the community.
We are committed to advocating for all children, reaching out into the community and the state to advocate for high quality care for all families.

Equally important, we feel that a safe, nurturing environment that provides opportunities for children to learn and develop through activities which are age and individually appropriate is important as well. Our program provides a rich inclusive environment that promotes children's active exploration in all areas of development: physical, emotional, linguistic, aesthetic and cognitive. Little Cubs Preschool teachers show their respect for all children by encouraging them to think for themselves, make decisions, work toward their own situations, and express their own ideas and feelings.

Our program is child centered and flexible. We use a curriculum that is integrated and introduces meaningful projects that sparks the children's natural curiosities, interests, and enthusiasm. While introducing various topics and weekly themes, the children explore by hands-on experience within the classroom centers and circle time. We feel that learning opportunities for children are endless. And even though it may seem like they are just playing, in reality they are developing and polishing many skills needed for formal education.

We believe that a good parent-teacher relationship is necessary for maximum school success. Having open communication with parents is very important and critical for each child's success. This is done by continually keeping our daily communication connections open. Our open door policy allows parents the opportunity to come in anytime to help out in our classroom, visit, or observe their child whenever they would like to. We strive on offering a warm and welcoming environment to our preschool families, educators and community members while respecting the diversity of each and everyone's cultures and beliefs.

The knowledge our families share with us about their children is greatly appreciated. We use this information to enhance and enrich our program. We also seek input as well as feedback of any and all aspects of our program from our families.

It is a teaching philosophy that uses individualized and independent approach in a child-sized and prepared environment with the use of multisensory/didactic materials that provide the children the best opportunity for their natural and innate capability to work, learn, develop creativity and curiosity through questions, explorations, experimentations and investigation led by their inner directive and interest.

The Country Fair & Auction in March proved to be a tremendous success! Our thanks to each of you for your generous support and kind words as we started what appears to be a new tradition at Faith Bible Christian School. We had three main goals—(1) to build community, (2) raise some additional funds for the school, and (3) provide an event where God’s glory would be evident. From our perspective, we reached each of our three goals! The funds raised will help jump-start our STEM program and will go directly to FBCS programs.";"http://faithkids.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faith-Bible-Christian-School/286166964771614";;;"http://faithkids.org/admissions/";"http://faithkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2014-2015-Parent-Student-Handbook.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://faithkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Logo-banner2.png";;;;;;

Creative Minds operates seven eco-friendly and certified preschools and child development centers in the Portland, Metropolitan Area. Our schools are proud to offer media-free educational and healthy environments with the children's interests and parent's needs in mind. Creative Minds’ mission is to provide a progressive preschool program that helps foster life-long learning and developmental growth.

Creative Minds Learning Centers have been designed to encourage children to explore their interests in a creative and artistic setting. Certified with the State of Oregon and members of NAEYC, OAEYC, Oregon Environmental Council and other Early Childhood organizations, CMLC schools provide a progressive and positive environment for children, staff and families. Creative Minds has also been recognized as members of QRIS, selected as one of 25 Oregon Program of Quality schools and continues to be a leader in the Early Childhood Education field.

Our philosophy is to enrich children's lives with creative arts and accredited educational materials while developing self esteem, confidence and a sense of independence. While there are many approaches and ""labels"" for teaching young children, Creative Minds schools focuses on the basis of early childhood development being ""trichotomized"" into a trio of goals: (1) social/emotional development and (2) intellectual development and (3) the acquisition of meaningful and useful academic skills. Children are capable and willing to learn and naturally can begin to read at Pre-Kindergarten grade. It is our duty to guide the children during the day in a structured setting. The children depend on the security of a daily routine and come to school excited to see their friends and teachers.";"http://www.creativemindslearningcenter.com/preschool-childcare-locations.htm";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Creative-Minds-Learning-Center/119370476640";"Mon - Fri:

It is our desire as educators and caregivers to help children meet their fullest potential in these areas by providing an environment that is safe, supports risk-taking, and invites a sharing of ideas. There are three elements that we believe are conducive to establishing such an environment: (1) The teacher/caregiver acting as a guide; (2) The child's natural curiosity to direct his/her learning is encouraged; and (3) Promotion of respect for all things and all people. 
>
>     Providing students access to hands-on activities and allowing adequate time and space to use materials that reinforce the lesson being studied creates an opportunity for individual discovery and construction of knowledge to occur. Equally important to self-discovery is having the opportunity to study things that are meaningful and relevant to one's life and interests. Developing a curriculum around student interests fosters intrinsic motivation and stimulates a passion to learn. One way to take learning in a direction relevant to student interest is to invite student dialogue about the lessons and units of study. Given the opportunity for input, students generate ideas and set goals that make for much richer activities than we could have created. 
>     Helping children to develop a deep love and respect for themselves, others, and their environment occurs through an open sharing of ideas. When the voice of each child is heard, an environment evolves where students feel free to express themselves. We continuously encourage such dialogue. We believe children have greater respect for their teachers, their peers, and the lessons presented when they feel safe and sure of what is expected of them. In setting fair and consistent rules initially and stating the importance of every activity, students are shown respect for their presence and time. In turn they learn to respect themselves, others, and their environment. 
>
>     One of our hopes as educators/caregivers is to instill a love of learning in our students, as we share our passion for learning with them. In our competitive society it is important for students to not only receive a solid education, but to work with someone who is aware of and sensitive to their individual needs. We are such people and will always strive to be the best educators/caregivers that we can be.

By 1955, the growing enrollment made it obvious that a permanent home for the school was needed and in the summer of that year charter members John and Betty Gray donated the lot and materials to construct a new facility - from the ground up. Designed by noted Northwest architect Van Evera Bailey with the needs of a child in mind, all construction was done by the parents of the school.

Because the building and grounds were designed as a preschool from the start, Oswego Playschool includes built-in features and play apparatus unique to the area's preschools. In addition, the hundreds of toys and teaching aids accumulated through sixty years of play have become a priceless learning resource benefiting Oswego Playschool children to this day. Oswego Playschool is still one of the few cooperative preschools in Oregon that own their own facility, and the benefits are bountiful.

Oswego Playschool is a member of Parent Child Preschools of Oregon (PCPO), an organization consisting of approximately 60 parent cooperative preschools in Oregon. They provide parent education, family enrichment programs, training for school officers, teacher programs, and act as a resource for cooperative preschools.";"http://www.oswegoplayschool.com/contact-us.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oswego-Playschool/242936742484542";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.oswegoplayschool.com/files/theme/logo-reversed.png";;;;;;

We are currently staffed with one licensed teacher and one instructional assistant in each of our two sessions of preschool.  This enables us to maintain a teacher to student ratio of no more than 1:10.

The learning space at Neah-Kah-Nie Preschool is warm, spacious, and engaging.  We have a well-equipped classroom that offers our students opportunities to explore, play and develop important social, cognitive, and physical skills.  We also have a fenced playground, with developmentally appropriate equipment for young children to enable outdoor play.  For those days when outdoor recreation is not an option, we have tricycles and scooters that can be ridden in the breezeway.";"http://www.nknsd.org/home-page/neah-kah-nie-preschool/";;"8:15 am to 11:15 am, Monday through Friday

Each child is recognized as a unique individual, as well as an integral part of our community.

The Montessori House strives to guide the child along his or her own individual path of construction while nurturing the social responsibility needed to live within a cooperative community. It is our goal to provide an environment that recognizes the authentic nature of the child.

The Montessori teacher (guide) is trained to prepare the environment with activities that match the laws of development of the child and promote the children’s needs and desire for independence, language acquisition, social interaction, movement, and cognitive stimulation, as well as personal and environmental care.

We strive to have a strong, supportive, and vibrant learning community. We hope to create lasting relationships with the children and their families that are built on trust and mutual respect.";"http://www2.themontessorihouse.org/";;;;"http://www2.themontessorihouse.org/enrollment-and-tuition";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www2.themontessorihouse.org/images/logo.gif";;;;;;

Our secure building is handicap accessible.

We have two classes: the three-year-old “Red Class” meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the four-year-old “Blue Class” meets Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Both classes are held from 9:30 AM to noon. There are 18 students in each class. After-school Spanish and yoga classes are also available.

Since 1984, Hancock Street Preschool (HSP) has been inspiring the wonder and joy of life-long learning for children and adults. We believe that children are curious, competent individuals. We understand that children are capable of constructing knowledge through play and meaningful real-world experiences. We believe in the importance of relationships and community, and we value the uniqueness of each child and family.

At HSP, the teacher and families work together to create an environment that facilitates play for deeper interaction and inquiry. We encourage young children’s play by valuing their eagerness to learn, by providing them with space and time, by paying attention to their spontaneous interests, by presenting new inquiries and exploration activities, and by offering support as they problem solve. Children are compelled to connect with one another and are genuinely fascinated with one another’s words, ideas and actions. We encourage and respect those social connections and the resulting growth in social skills.";"http://www.hancockstreetpreschool.com/";;"9:30am-12nn";;"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5448f2f1e4b03aa5ab04220b/t/5458654ee4b0e16a796c6df8/1415079246035/HSP+application+2015-16.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5448f2f1e4b03aa5ab04220b/t/5520d472e4b08718933cfae1/1433779956186/?format=1500w";;;;;;

Located in Northeast Portland, just one block north of East Burnside Street, our campus offers a convenient location for many Portland-area neighborhoods.

We currently serve approximately 150 students with our thriving primary program for ages 2 1/2 through 6 and our growing elementary program for grades 1 through 6. We also offer before and after care as well as holiday and summer camps. Our school hours are from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM, with before and after care hours extending the day from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday.

Mary Hicks serves as the Head of School. During her tenure, she has expanded the elementary program to include upper elementary grades. She also helped shepherd the school’s smooth and successful transition to independent, non-profit status. The school officially became The Portland Montessori School on January 1, 2013.

Our guides, head of school and most staff members are certified by the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) to ensure we guide our students using internationally recognized standards of educational excellence.

Children have time for free play, exposure to a variety materials, plenty of playmates, and teachers ready support their creative process. We are interested in the way children organize their world when adults step back and allow them to make messes and interact with their environment in their own way. Children at our school will get messy, get muddy, get wet, and get covered in sand in the sand pit when they want to. They will run some, scream some, dance some, and laugh often!

Serving Portland families since 1950, we offer customized programs to meet the developmental needs of your child and accommodate your needs and schedule. Multi-age classes foster social unity and peer-to-peer learning under the expert guidance of our trained and experienced staff.  All of our classrooms from the Rose Room (Toddler’s) through the Aspen Room (Older Preschool) are introduced to basic Spanish vocabulary; and the older children (Willow and Azalea rooms) benefit from the richness of an immersive afternoon Spanish program.

Classroom teachers observe and document the children’s progress regularly and formally evaluate them four times throughout the school year. These evaluations are always available to parents and are utilized during parent/teacher conferences in the Fall and Spring.

Enriched creative and emergent curriculum, engaging classrooms, nutritional lunch and snacks, and expansive playgrounds with outdoor gardens provide your child a rich and diverse environment in which to learn and grow. Your child will be more than prepared to transition on to a public or private school after spending their foundational years at the West Hills Learning Center.";"http://www.westhillslearning.com/";;"Monday - Friday

Our curriculum is designed to develop children’s knowledge and skills in all developmental areas and establish a foundation for lifelong learning. The curriculum and instruction is age-appropriate, integrated, hands-on, and responsive to individual differences in ability and interests.

We believe that education is a process, brought on by the child’s interaction with their immediate world. It is through playing in this world that each child is encouraged and stimulated to explore, to experiment and to discover, using their own unique learning style and interests. We use an emergent curriculum that builds upon the interests of the children. Teachers document children’s work, validating the children’s abilities and enabling ongoing assessment. This approach helps children to develop curiosity, creativity, differing modes of communication, concentration, listening, negotiation and observation skills.";"http://www.blueskies-butterflies.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Children are encouraged to learn at their own pace through multisensory exploration and social interaction. By listening to stories, playing games, drawing, and singing, children develop fine and gross motor skills, learn about relationships and feelings, and gain critical-thinking and language abilities that will serve them throughout their lives.

At the same time, the preschool's German language setting supports German-speaking children who are learning the language from their parents outside their native country, and also allows non-German speakers a chance to learn a second language at an age when it comes most easily.

The mixed-age classroom experience provides opportunities for the older children to serve as role models for the younger ones.

Much research on children's learning and development documents the benefits of play for children's intellectual, social, emotional, physical, and language development. Our students develop through their experiences with art, song, movement, games, stories, yoga, poems, sign language, outdoor activity, and guided discussion.

    Children at play are actively involved in creating themes, exploring and establishing relationships, solving problems and developing shared understanding.
    Children engage in ""parallel play"" — near each other but with each child engrossed in his own activity.
    As children get older, they play cooperatively, organizing roles and scenarios for group play.
    When kids play with each other, they learn to see other children's points of view and begin to understand customs and rules in their own culture and to appreciate those of others.
    They learn to use language in new ways to describe their play and interact with others.
    They develop early math and science skills, while improving on their imagination and creativity.
    And in play, children develop their muscles and coordination.

SWPCC offers a 4 hour per day preschool. Children from 2 to 5 years old can attend up to four days a week; children between 1 and 2 years old can attend up to three days a week. Prospective members should plan to make 2 two-hour visits to the co-op before joining. You and your child will enjoy seeing our classrooms and meeting the children and teacher.

Our goal is to provide a developmentally appropriate, early childhood educational program in partnership with teachers, parents, and children.

 Our Beliefs
We believe each child deserves an emotionally and a physically safe world in which to explore, experiment, take risks and make constructive errors; a world in which to experience unconditional love, acceptance, and belonging.

 Our Commitment
We are committed to a program that strengthens in our children a sense of themselves as lovable people, and empowering them to be independent, caring individuals.  We believe in a program that continually encourages in our children curiosity, excitement, imagination and love of learning.

Our mission is to promote the health and well-being of families by bringing drop-in child care to the hospital so that children can thrive as families heal, according to the My Little Waiting Room Child's Bill of Rights.

We figure since grocery stores, gyms, community centers and other locations offer this needed service, hospitals should too. Especially since families at the hospital are often in crisis and could really use the help. That's why we're working with two local hospitals and a professional child care provider to help families in need. 

We believe for families to realize the brightest possible futures together, their ability to obtain medical attention is vital. We further believe children have the right to thrive as their family members seek that care. That's why we've written the following Bill of Rights which guides our project:";"https://sites.google.com/site/mylittlewaitingroomorg/";"https://www.facebook.com/MyLittleWaitingRoom?ref=mf";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"https://sites.google.com/site/mylittlewaitingroomorg/_/rsrc/1253213746649/who-we-are/Header.jpg?height=150&width=700";;;;;;

Our centers offer The Creative Curriculum. This program model allows your child to choose and study areas that (s)he is interested in.

The Montessori education journey all began with Dr. Maria Montessori. Through scientific observations, she determined children learn best at their own pace and given the choice of activities. At Montessori Unlimited, the practical application of sensory-based and self-directed learning is the most important thread across all our programs:

    Montessori Toddler
    Montessori Primary
    Montessori Elementary

Each program builds on the one before it, providing challenges appropriate to both age and skill levels. Language, mathematics, spatial learning, self-discovery, music, and art are all incorporated into our approach. In addition, we offer enrichment programs to enhance learning and Summer Camp to continue Montessori learning during the summer.";"http://www.montessori.com/montessori-schools/portland-or-7342/";;"07:00 AM - 06:00 PM";"http://www.montessori.com/about-us/child-care-careers/";"http://www.montessori.com/montessori-schools/enrollment/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

Our activities stimulate children’s physical and intellectual development and foster social and emotional growth. Our program seeks to encourage children to think, reason, question and experiment. Through hands-on activities and challenges, the children become willing participants in their own learning cognitively, emotionally, socially, physically and culturally.

When you entrust the care and early education of your child to us, you can expect that the principles guiding that care are rooted in manifesting the following goals cited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC):

Relationships: That interactions between children and adults provide opportunities for children to develop an understanding of self and others and are characterized by warmth, personal respect, individuality, positive support and responsiveness. Our teachers facilitate interactions among children to provide opportunities for the development of self-esteem, social competence and intellectual growth.

Curriculum: That our curriculum implementation “reflects the knowledge that young children are active learners, drawing on direct physical and social experience as well as culturally transmitted knowledge to construct their understanding of the world around them.” Program quality is enhanced when “the curriculum encourages children to be actively involved in the learning process, to experience a variety of developmentally appropriate activities and materials. Young children learn through active manipulation of the environment and concrete experiences that contribute to concept development.”

Partnership: That teachers and families work closely in partnership to ensure high-quality care and education for children, and parents feel supported and welcomed as observers and contributors to the program. We believe in empowering parents by involving them in ongoing relationships as full partners with teachers in supporting their child’s development. “Young children are integrally connected to their families. Programs cannot adequately meet the needs of children unless they also recognize the importance of the child’s family and establish positive relationships with families based on mutual trust and respect. All communication between programs and families should be two-way, but also based on the concept that parents are and should be the principal influence in their children’s lives.”

At Joyful Noise Child Development Centers we plan activities that encourage cooperation, experimentation, and communication among children. We do not force children to operate as a large group for long periods of time. Instead we encourage children to let their curiosity and initiative drive them to make choices from a variety of classroom activities. Our teachers act as guides for these explorations, and investigators along side the children. Our Emergent Curriculum and extensive Projects speak to the children’s individual interests and allow learning within a meaningful context. The children in our centers learn to negotiate, solve problems, and construct their own code of ethics; thereby learning true compassion and developing intrinsically motivated empathy.

Parents who choose such developmentally appropriate environments for their children give them a much greater gift than any rote math or phonics lesson can. Combine this with stability, interaction, communication, and love, within the context of firm boundaries, and their children will have the foundations for successful future learning.

We seek to provide a safe, healthy, developmentally appropriate environment for children to explore their growing sense of self and understanding of the world.

Incorporated into our play-based curriculum is an emphasis on social anti-bias, understanding and acceptance of diversity.

In our program, children learn to get along with others, exercise their developing gross and fine motor skills, communicate verbally and explore creative materials. Abundant opportunities for self-expression are offered. Outdoor play is integral to our daily curriculum.[pb_builder]

To inspire and enable all youth, grades 1-12, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens through the development of a positive self-image and self-reliance.
Why Great Futures Start Here:

Children are encouraged to develop self-discipline and a respect for others.  We maintain a nonsexist, non-racist setting for children's learning.  We believe it is important to enhance the development of a positive self-image in each child.  We accomplish this by providing warmth and nurturing in a growth-facilitating environment rich with opportunities to learn and discover. 

 

Our goal is to provide parents with an open, welcoming atmosphere to encourage and promote parent involvement and parent peace of mind.  We work to develop a one-to-one relationship with each child and parent, communicating to the child that they are ""cared about"" as well as ""cared for"".  We accomplish this by providing the best suited staff; qualified and dedicated to understanding the needs of the children and families.

Further, we seek to extend the children's environment beyond the classroom and into the community.
We are committed to advocating for all children, reaching out into the community and the state to advocate for high quality care for all families.
 

It is the policy of Salem Child Development Center that no person shall be discriminated against by reason of race, color, religion, disability, sex, age or national origin.

After School Care is designed to be a home-like atmosphere offering the comfort of rhythm in the afternoon schedule, without the demands of structured activities. This allows for the children to have the kind of ""outbreathing"" that they need after a day of more focused activities at school. Space is provided for creative play both indoors and outside, and craft materials are available for activities such as finger knitting or coloring. Occasionally, the ASC teacher will lead a craft activity or a game. Donations of yarn and other material for the ASC program are always welcomed.

From 12:30 until 2:45 pm, After School Care is divided into two groups according to age. Early childhood ASC is held in the early childhood building by an early childhood teacher. At 2:45, the younger children join the older students in the grades ASC room, located across from the reception office. All children must be supervised after school; any child grade 4 and younger will be brought to ASC if not picked up within 15 minutes of school dismissal.

Early childhood ASC is contracted on a term basis; click the link below to print a copy of the contract. Grades ASC is scheduled monthly, as well as care for children 6 and under from 2:45 - 5:30 pm ASC may also be scheduled on a daily basis if space is available. For information about the monthly care option, click the ""Information and Agreement"" link below.

ASC is mostly used by working parents as a safe and convenient option for child care during working hours. The ASC program is available for currently-enrolled students only. After School Care may be free to parents at the time they are engaged in volunteer work at the school, such as attending an official meeting, preparing for a school festival, etc. If you are in doubt about whether your activity qualifies you for this, ask at the reception office. Children using ASC in this capacity should still be prescheduled in order to assure that the appropriate amount of adult supervision is arranged.";"http://www.eugenewaldorf.org/programs/after_school_care/";;"8:25am-3pm";"http://www.eugenewaldorf.org/contact/employment/";"http://www.eugenewaldorf.org/admissions/";"http://www.eugenewaldorf.org/pdf/Parent_Handbook.pdf";"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;;;;;;

We are also dedicated to maintaining the high academic standards established by the Oregon Department of Education.

The Montessori method is based on a respect for children and the individual’s desire to learn. The children at Far Horizons are aided and directed in the process of self education by trained Montessori teachers and the Montessori learning materials. A natural inner order leads the child from interest to interest and subject to subject. The curriculum is individualized, although group lessons are regularly scheduled to present new subjects.

Our Montessori classrooms develop the privileges and responsibilities of freedom. The child learns care of the environment and the person as well as following his or her sensitive learning periods to more specific types of knowledge and subject matter.

Montessori learning materials and apparatus help the child master practical life experiences building concentration which progresses to math, language, geography, history, etc. The materials are sensorial based, aiding the child to develop a well defined concrete concept which leads to abstract concept formulation.

Far Horizons Montessori School, a private school, offers a curriculum including the Montessori method, art, music, drama, foreign languages, computer use, and physical education as well as the traditional subjects; mathematics, reading, social studies, handwriting, health, and science.

To cultivate the child’s own natural curiosity and love of learning To foster independence and a positive self image.
To develop respect for each other and the creatures and things around us.
To prepare them for life.
The Environment
For the parents who value and love learning, we have created a rich learning environment in a rural setting. Our staff love their work and the children do too. In this place the children can explore their environment and improve their skills.
They learn to “play well with others”, listening respectfully (and quietly) while teachers and friends are talking, and learn to make choices for themselves. With this foundation our children will have the confidence, skills and tools necessary to creatively meet the yet unknown challenges in the future.

The decision to place your child in a childcare center, home, day care or preschool in Bend is one of the tough decisions we as parents face.  From placing a 6 week old, newborn child – to potty training toddlers and working with special needs or the gifted and talented, we at Crawmer’s aim to makes this road a little easier with some guidance along the way.

Did you know that recent research shows children learn the most rapidly before the age of six?  This is why at Crawmer’s Critterz we strive to teach them skills that will prepare them for their future.  We teach common skills such as table manners, please and thank you, but also we reach for more then just common, we aim for the heart.

Using American Sign Language our students learn to communicate with both the hearing and deaf.  ASL is the second language used daily for children from 6 weeks to 12 years.  Children learn how to read words in sign before they can read letters in a book!

Humor is a daily part of our lesson plans.  Students learn to laugh out loud at the ridiculous adults that fit right in as children.  Drama and the arts are a passion of ours.  We hold a daily art class; teaching the children about the technical, creative and free style art in our culture. This allows them to experience art in their own way.

Our curriculum Mother Goose Time teaches students phonics, math, science, weather, geography, rhymes, finger plays, letters, numbers and counting all through daily art, crafts and circle time.  As Bend preschool teachers we enjoy bringing a flare of drama to the program—engaging each other and our students to act out good, bad and just plain crazy behaviors, short stories and famous events.

Our final love is music— bringing a sparkle to each child’s eye.  With the wide variety available children should not become bored with the mundane but be excited about the varieties from classical to hip-hop.  In the summer session we teach rhythm and musical patterns.

Here at Crawmer’s, our days are so packed full of fun our students just don’t want to go home!  TV, you ask… what TV?  There is simply not enough time to watch it nor does our programming allow for it.

The program operates at Crooked River Elementary school on school days between 3 and 6 p.m. The program occasionally operates on non-school days (week days) between 7:45 a.m. and 6 p.m. Every day, students can get a snack, receive help with homework, mentoring and reading, participate in recreation activities and explore science rich activities through Crook County 4-H. All students K-5th grade are welcome to sign up, but space is limited so there may be a waiting list.

The collaborating partners of Crook County After the Bell believe positive youth development does not happen by chance. It results from intentional efforts of parents, schools, youth organizations, and communities. The approach of this after school program is simple: to provide a safe, academic, and enriching environment for elementary school aged youth throughout the community, whom engage in research based activities which help develop five core competencies needed by youth to experience economic and social success in adulthood while making positive contributions to their communities. The five core competencies include: competence, confidence, connection, character and compassion.Through this dynamic collaboration, children participating in the program will have the opportunity to achieve such competencies through programming intended to improve academic achievement, through the opportunity to experience relationship with caring adults, and through engagement in mentoring programs with high school aged youth. The program will intentionally implement and foster these experiences through three main programming thrusts: science, healthy living, and civic engagement.

The school's philosophy is that children's learning should be developmentally appropriate and facilitated through play, and also that parents are an important part of a child's education.

Incorporated as a co-op preschool, Start Here has only two paid staff-members, the teachers. The school operates through the daily efforts of parents. It is parents who keep the child to adult ratio low by volunteering in class on a rotating basis. Parents also oversee the day-to-day operation of the school through filling positions on the school's non-profit board of directors. The building maintenance is also completed by parents. As a result of this level of participation, parents have a familiarity with all aspects of their children's preschool experience that simply isn't possible through any other program structure.

When children walk in the door at Start Here preschool, they want to stay. Start Here provides a classroom environment that is welcoming to children and supports learning. The space is divided into interest areas that appeal to children and encourage distinct kinds of play. Throughout the school year, children see their artwork on the wall or hanging from the ceiling and feel a sense of belonging. Start Here prepares children for kindergarten first through social and emotional development. The school functions on the belief that in order for children to be ready for a traditional classroom setting, they first must learn how to interact constructively with their teachers and peers. This social and emotional instruction comes in a variety of ways. In circle time, children learn to expand their levels of self-control, to listen when their teachers are talking, and to take turns speaking. Children also learn these important social skills during free-play time, when the teachers and parent volunteers model how to give and take through play.    Children's natural interests are encouraged at Start Here through the constantly changing themed units incorporated throughout the year. While the teachers continue to expand and add to the themes used, some long-standing units include dinosaurs, space, oceans, and transportation. For each unit, the teachers transform the classroom using decorations, books, manipulatives, puzzles, and theme- appropriate toys. In circle time, the teachers expand upon the current theme with books and songs.

At Start Here, children's academic instruction is given at a developmentally appropriate level. Children learn early academic skills during circle time, with its focus on literacy, but also during learning center times. These small-group settings involve no more than five children to one adult and allow children to explore at a deeper level a topic or project within the school's current themed unit. Founded in 1973, Start Here has been an enduring contributor to the school community in Redmond. The long-standing success of the preschool is the best evidence for the quality of education that the school provides for the preschool child. The requirements of the program on the part of parents mean it is not the right choice for every family, but for those who do choose it, Start Here becomes a memorable and treasured part of the special preschool years for both parent and child.

Barb Gerulf, owner of Giggle Tree Daycare wanted to retire, but saw the continued need to have a childcare center in Ontario.  Barb and Pastor James Aalgaard presented the opportunity of opening up a childcare center at St. Paul’s to St. Paul’s Lutheran Church’s congregation. Barb’s dream of a new center and continuing to serve the families that are currently being served came true. Through a capital campaign and Mission Builders, Giggles & Grace has come to life to serve children ages 6 weeks up to 12 years of age.

Giggles & Grace Early Learning Center is currently licensed for 70 children.  Currently Giggles & Grace has four classrooms serving, infants/toddlers, two-three year olds, four-five year olds and before and after school age children as well as a daytime pre-school.

In 1970, Primm Day Care Center was established by Rev. and Mrs. Edward N. Smith Jr. and the members of Primm Tabernacle AME Church.  Friends of Primm at the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church of Mercer Island also assisted.  Until 1975, the center was licensed for 21 children from ages 21/2 to 12 years when a second site was purchased on Rainier Avenue South.  This expanded our services to care for 28 additional children.

In 1977, the center relocated to its present location and is now licensed for 45 children, from toddlers to pre-adolescent age.  Donations of services and equipment have come from many sources:  the City's Department of Human Resources, the Boeing Employees Good Neighbore Fund, board members and many friends.  They have provided us the opportunity to serve many families through the years.

The program is child-centered and offers a variety of challenging activities and materials to enable each child to create and to discover the joys learning has to offer.

In the past, we have been able to offer before and after school enrichment programs for schoolagers at the original MLK school and Dearborn Park elementary schools.

We offer a free full-day preschool for children who are 4 years old by August 31st under the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program (ECEAP) on Mondays through Thursdays from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm.  Click here for a flyer with additional information and the current income guidelines for the program.

In 1973, Pastor Walt Henderson began directing a new Colbert Chapel Preschool.  After working with the preschool for three years, a need became clear for a Christian-based daycare in the area.  Together with his wife Geri, and a fellow church member, Billye Anderson, Chapel Children's Center was formed.  In the words of Billye Anderson, ""This was a time when families were stil adjusting to both parents working.  We knew that if children had to be out of the home we wanted them to be in a good safe place, in the love of Christian people.""

Years later, our center still has the same goals.  Family has stayed close.  Two main supervisors in the Daycare are Ms. Jackie, daughter of Walt and Geri Henderson, and Ms. Shelly, niece of Billye Anderson.  Current director, Elaine Sherer, has attended Colbert Chapel church since early childhood, worked at the Daycare during high school and has been in the position as director since 1997.

Our center has a unique experience to offer your family.  Many of our current families have been with us for years, and have come to know Colbert Chapel and Chapel Children's Center as their ""home away from home"".  We hope your family can join them.

Our programs are located onsite at 9 Seattle Public Schools (SPS) in Central, West, and Southeast Seattle and serve a diverse population of students. All of the SPS schools we serve except one are Title I schools, meaning that they receive additional federal funding because they serve a disproportionate amount of lower-income students and need additional support to ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards.

Due to budget cuts, public schools are increasingly relying on our services and programs to help students who are in need of extra support. At CDSA we teach the academic and social skills needed for long-term success: science and math through nature walks, cooking, music, building models, and science experiments; empathy through arts and drama; self-expression through music and dance; and other hands-on learning opportunities. We individualize our learning plans for our children and focus on decision-making and empowering them to grow an internal compass to guide them toward good choices in life.

Our curriculum, activities, and room arrangements are all tailored to be age appropriate. Additionally, our curriculum follows both weekly and monthly themes.

A typical day at Kid’s Country will include activities like reading, looking at books, writing, drawing, dancing, singing, cutting, pasting, painting, assembling art projects, experimenting, exploring, and enjoying the environment. One of our primary areas of focus is meeting each child’s individual needs. We encourage children to progress at their own pace and they are placed in the classroom that will help them the best. This encourages self-confidence and healthy growth which results in a strong, positive self-image.

In fact, the Kid’s Country motto is to allow children to love, laugh, learn, and grow. By keeping the environment fun and positive, we create a safe haven—a home away from home—for your children. All of our classrooms are warm, cozy, and filled with personal touches that allow your kids to feel comfortable. It is our responsibility to work in partnership with your family and help enhance and support, not replace, the relationship between parents and children.

One of the ways we do this is by placing a high priority on ongoing training for our managers and staff. Every month each of our teachers is trained on a different topic relating to child care and the issues we face in providing for your children. This allows us to better meet the needs of the kids we care for, as well as to provide a better, cleaner, happier, and safer environment.

At Kid’s Country, we take the safety of your children very seriously. All of our facilities are equipped with pass card protected entrances. We are also alerted to those arriving and exiting through the main entrance. In order to gain admittance, an entry reader card must be used, though we do have a doorbell available to notify our staff of any guests or parents who need access.

We hope you can see how important caring for your children is to all of us at Kid’s Country. We pride ourselves on being a premier and trustworthy child care provider for the Seattle area. Watching your kids grow and learn gives us joy and fulfillment. If you like what you see, we invite you to learn more by touring one of our facilities. Hopefully you’ll then apply for admission, which is granted without discrimination or regard to race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, or religion.

Our curriculum, activities, and room arrangements are all tailored to be age appropriate. Additionally, our curriculum follows both weekly and monthly themes.

A typical day at Kid’s Country will include activities like reading, looking at books, writing, drawing, dancing, singing, cutting, pasting, painting, assembling art projects, experimenting, exploring, and enjoying the environment. One of our primary areas of focus is meeting each child’s individual needs. We encourage children to progress at their own pace and they are placed in the classroom that will help them the best. This encourages self-confidence and healthy growth which results in a strong, positive self-image.

In fact, the Kid’s Country motto is to allow children to love, laugh, learn, and grow. By keeping the environment fun and positive, we create a safe haven—a home away from home—for your children. All of our classrooms are warm, cozy, and filled with personal touches that allow your kids to feel comfortable. It is our responsibility to work in partnership with your family and help enhance and support, not replace, the relationship between parents and children.

One of the ways we do this is by placing a high priority on ongoing training for our managers and staff. Every month each of our teachers is trained on a different topic relating to child care and the issues we face in providing for your children. This allows us to better meet the needs of the kids we care for, as well as to provide a better, cleaner, happier, and safer environment.

At Kid’s Country, we take the safety of your children very seriously. All of our facilities are equipped with pass card protected entrances. We are also alerted to those arriving and exiting through the main entrance. In order to gain admittance, an entry reader card must be used, though we do have a doorbell available to notify our staff of any guests or parents who need access.

We hope you can see how important caring for your children is to all of us at Kid’s Country. We pride ourselves on being a premier and trustworthy child care provider for the Seattle area. Watching your kids grow and learn gives us joy and fulfillment. If you like what you see, we invite you to learn more by touring one of our facilities. Hopefully you’ll then apply for admission, which is granted without discrimination or regard to race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, or religion.

Maria Montessori, Italy's first woman doctor developed it, in the early 1900's. Her materials and methods have withstood the test of time. The adults who work in the Montessori program are trained to be observers of the children and preparers of the children's environment. The emphasis is on learning rather than on teaching. The materials in the program are intended to help the children in their drive to sort out their experiences and master the skills they need. As children become more and more competent, the confidence is reinforced and they develop good feeling about themselves. The unique materials Montessori created are perhaps the best known aspect of the system.

There are practical life materials. These materials are designed to prepare children for real-life experiences. They help children develop skills, which will increase their independence and confidence in themselves. There are sensorial materials. These materials are designed to isolate for the children the properties of thins and to help them refine and organize in their mind what they are absorbing through their senses. There are math materials. The purpose of these materials in to ensure that the process of mathematical abstraction is based on concrete experiences with manipulative materials. There are language materials. These materials offer a systematic breakdown of the elements of reading that enables children to experience concretely the structure of the language. There are also cultural materials. These materials include geography, botany, history, astronomy zoology, physical science, art, and languages. The purpose of these materials is to sharpen the child's powers of observation and understanding of the world around him.

One of Dr. Montessori's observations about children was that there are certain stages when children are especially ready to learn a particular thing. She called them ""sensitive periods."" She observed that if children were given the opportunity to learn a particular skill during their sensitive periods that never again could they learn it so easily or so well. The Montessori classroom is designed to offer children the opportunity to learn and develop according to their sensitive periods.

Maria Montessori also discovered that young children are able to concentrate to a far greater extent than adults realized if an activity meets their needs, and if the process allows physical involvement. Adults often think young children have short attention spans when the problem is that they are seldom given activities worthy of their attention or appropriate to their style of learning. To encourage concentration in children their needs for repetition must be met, and time allowed practicing that particular skill. The Montessori classroom encourages concentration by offering a wide variety of materials from which children can choose according to their needs and by allowing children to use them repetitively until their needs are met.

The Montessori Classroom tries to foster and nourish the fundamental needs of children. In the Montessori classroom the fundamental needs of children are considered to be the need for movement, the need for language development, the need for independence, the need for love and security, the need for discipline, and the need for order.

After a while, with cooperation of the school and the home and a real understanding of how to cater to the child's needs, Maria Montessori described how children become normalized. The normalized child is one who has a love of order, a love of work, a love of silence and working alone, profound spontaneous concentration, obedience, independence and initiative, spontaneous self-discipline, attachment to reality, and joy.";"http://discoverymontessori.org";;"6am-5:30pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://discoverymontessori.org/indeximagemap.jpg";;;;;;

Our curriculum, activities, and room arrangements are all tailored to be age appropriate. Additionally, our curriculum follows both weekly and monthly themes.

A typical day at Kid’s Country will include activities like reading, looking at books, writing, drawing, dancing, singing, cutting, pasting, painting, assembling art projects, experimenting, exploring, and enjoying the environment. One of our primary areas of focus is meeting each child’s individual needs. We encourage children to progress at their own pace and they are placed in the classroom that will help them the best. This encourages self-confidence and healthy growth which results in a strong, positive self-image.

In fact, the Kid’s Country motto is to allow children to love, laugh, learn, and grow. By keeping the environment fun and positive, we create a safe haven—a home away from home—for your children. All of our classrooms are warm, cozy, and filled with personal touches that allow your kids to feel comfortable. It is our responsibility to work in partnership with your family and help enhance and support, not replace, the relationship between parents and children.

One of the ways we do this is by placing a high priority on ongoing training for our managers and staff. Every month each of our teachers is trained on a different topic relating to child care and the issues we face in providing for your children. This allows us to better meet the needs of the kids we care for, as well as to provide a better, cleaner, happier, and safer environment.

At Kid’s Country, we take the safety of your children very seriously. All of our facilities are equipped with pass card protected entrances. We are also alerted to those arriving and exiting through the main entrance. In order to gain admittance, an entry reader card must be used, though we do have a doorbell available to notify our staff of any guests or parents who need access.

We hope you can see how important caring for your children is to all of us at Kid’s Country. We pride ourselves on being a premier and trustworthy child care provider for the Seattle area. Watching your kids grow and learn gives us joy and fulfillment. If you like what you see, we invite you to learn more by touring one of our facilities. Hopefully you’ll then apply for admission, which is granted without discrimination or regard to race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, or religion.

Teachers listen to the children’s interests and questions and provide props and materials to help the children follow their investigations.  The teachers learn with the children as they explore the environment of the school and neighborhood community.

The homelike atmosphere comes in part from the size of the Center, with eight toddlers and eighteen preschoolers.  CBCC maintains a low teacher to child ratio, 1:4 for toddlers and 1:6 for preschool.  This allows more one on one time for caring and nurturing the children and their learning.

The CBCC environment is beautiful and homelike, and stimulating to children’s curiosity and learning.  Materials and natural elements are displayed beautifully and thoughtfully throughout the environment.  Children’s work is given value and importance through documentation and display.

Established in the Rainier Valley in 1969, Tiny Tots Development Center (TTDC) provides child care services and early childhood education at several sites throughout South Seattle. Its main campus (above) – located at 8302 Renton Avenue South – is the organization’s largest site.

Seven long years in the making, the new campus is named after Tiny Tots founder and CEO Helen Hicks – known affectionately throughout the community as “Mama Hicks” (cutting the ribbon below).

Executive Director Angelia Maxie (below) welcomed friends, family and guests, including the fathers of former students who attended the Main Campus more than 25 years ago and are now attending college, teaching English abroad and raising their own families.

The school’s bright new building was made possible with assistance from the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, the City of Seattle, Bank of America and others.

The Tiny Tots-Bright Bell Birds program and an Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program (ECEAP) preschool program will move in this summer and begin educational programs in the new building in September 2010.

Meanwhile, Tiny Tots Main, the site of our original program, will continue to house preschool, infant care, and childcare at 8318 Renton Avenue South (below).

Our staff is knowledgeable and trained in all areas. We have a carefully planned program with age appropriate, structured activities, as well as supervised free time.

Our goal is to provide opportunities for growth in all areas of development. We realize that in the early years it is critical in the development of your child for there to be challenges as they grow and mature. We want to provide challenges, but not make unreasonable demands that only make the child feel defeated.

We will provide opportunities for your child’s optimal growth and development such as:
·         Group activities that foster skills such as following directions and cooperation
·         Cutting, gluing, and drawing to develop fine motor skills.
·         Language skills are fostered in choice centers such as blocks and house keeping
·         Gross motor skills are also developed through organized and free choice activities.

All of these activities provide a structured environment for developing personal and group socialization as well as a basic preparation for their school year.        
As the child progresses into kindergarten, our goal is to enhance their success in school. We continue to work on cooperation, creativity, and individuality while preparing them with age appropriate activities to ensure their success in school.
At Rainbow’s End we strive to be an extension of home. In addition to providing a strong curriculum for our Preschool, we assist parents of school age children by providing homework help, individual reading times, journaling and using “calming cards” to problem solve and release stress from the school day.
Professional referrals will be posted in the front office to assist parents with the needs of their children.";"http://rainbowsendkids.weebly.com/";;"5:30am until 6:30pm Monday thru Friday";;"http://rainbowsendkids.weebly.com/registration-forms.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

At Suginoko Preschool, programs are carefully prepared and given to each child based on the child's age and maturity. A small student-to-teacher ratio insures that every child gets plenty of attention. Teachers are able to respond to individual learning styles and work one-on-one as needed.

Our daycare center philosophy is designed to enhance the whole child in a positive atmosphere of warmth and caring. Through our awareness of child development and consistency in our care, our goal is to meet the physical, intellectual, emotional, and social needs that are unique to each child.

Children learn through their daily experiences and routines to make decisions, to carry out responsibilities, to express him/herself creatively and to discover friendships. Children are exposed to movement, art, music, reading, science, dramatic play, life skills, blocks, outdoor play, and manipulative experiences. Themes are planned around the interests of each group of new children and staff. A daily schedule helps to provide familiar flow to each day. We make every effort to achieve these goals through the partnership of child, parent, and childcare center staff.

Nearly 4,000 people live, work, study, play, farm, and raise families in this river-hugging community wedged at the heart of the Duwamish Valley industrial corridor. Students, parents, business owners, artists, machinists, environmentalists, and civic leaders all call South Park home.

Seattle’s only riverfront neighborhood is also home to the city’s only working farm: Marra Farm, which generates tons of fresh, organic produce each year. The popular South Park Community Center offers numerous activities that are open to the public, including recreation and sports, after school and senior activities, and community events and meetings.

Environmental stewardship is present in the South Park consciousness. Despite the proximate Duwamish Waterway Superfund site, residents envision a cleaner, greener future for their community and for the Duwamish River wildlife corridor. Anyone can join the residents of South Park to participate in the annual Duwamish Alive! community cleanup events.

Neighborhood parks provide islands of open space for play, gatherings, and relaxation, including the Duwamish Waterway Park, Cesar Chavez Park, South Park Playground, and Marra-Desimone Park, plus the newly constructed River City Skate Park for skate rats.";"http://www.allaboutsouthpark.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/southparkseattle";;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Children are motivated with creative play and exposure to math, reading, science, social studies, and the arts.

Our program is built around the concept that children are born ready to learn. As caregivers, we strive to create a quality learning environment that is safe, stimulating and encouraging. We believe in learning through sensory and discovery experiences that are both challenging and enjoyable. We provide an environment that encourages each child to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially. This is accomplished in a relaxed play and learning environment that balances structured and unstructured time, planned and emergent curriculum. We provide developmentally appropriate activities based upon child growth and development theories, recent research in child development, and the time-tested culture of childhood. We recognize that as we all learn and grow our thinking must be flexible and open to review, modification and change. We view parents as partners and we strive to support the family through involvement and educational opportunities at ABC Early Learning Academy.";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/ABC-Early-Learning-Academy/312886002146642?sk=info&tab=page_info";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/ABC-Early-Learning-Academy/312886002146642?sk=info&tab=page_info";"Mon - Fri:

We strive to create a caring, loving, and nurturing environment, one that promotes both individual learning as well as group learning.  Children learn in so many different ways, and we feel that it is necessary for them to have the proper tools that will lead to new experiences, and help to enhance their abilities and strengths even further.  Learning requires active thinking, and hands on activities to let them learn first hand about the world around them.  A child that is absorbed in the positive components of life has little time to focus on the negatives.

We want our children to grow up with the knowledge that they can make a positive difference in their life, as well as in the lives of others around them.  It is our goal as caregivers and educators to help each child achieve his/her own level of excellence.  To do this, we need to work as a team.  This means that our center will work with you, the parents, in projecting the most positive influence possible.

We all want the best for our children; they are our future, and we must never
lose sight of that fact.  As a community of caregivers and parents, we need to

Our curriculum, activities, and room arrangements are all tailored to be age appropriate. Additionally, our curriculum follows both weekly and monthly themes.

A typical day at Kid’s Country will include activities like reading, looking at books, writing, drawing, dancing, singing, cutting, pasting, painting, assembling art projects, experimenting, exploring, and enjoying the environment. One of our primary areas of focus is meeting each child’s individual needs. We encourage children to progress at their own pace and they are placed in the classroom that will help them the best. This encourages self-confidence and healthy growth which results in a strong, positive self-image.

In fact, the Kid’s Country motto is to allow children to love, laugh, learn, and grow. By keeping the environment fun and positive, we create a safe haven—a home away from home—for your children. All of our classrooms are warm, cozy, and filled with personal touches that allow your kids to feel comfortable. It is our responsibility to work in partnership with your family and help enhance and support, not replace, the relationship between parents and children.

One of the ways we do this is by placing a high priority on ongoing training for our managers and staff. Every month each of our teachers is trained on a different topic relating to child care and the issues we face in providing for your children. This allows us to better meet the needs of the kids we care for, as well as to provide a better, cleaner, happier, and safer environment.

At Kid’s Country, we take the safety of your children very seriously. All of our facilities are equipped with pass card protected entrances. We are also alerted to those arriving and exiting through the main entrance. In order to gain admittance, an entry reader card must be used, though we do have a doorbell available to notify our staff of any guests or parents who need access.

We hope you can see how important caring for your children is to all of us at Kid’s Country. We pride ourselves on being a premier and trustworthy child care provider for the Seattle area. Watching your kids grow and learn gives us joy and fulfillment. If you like what you see, we invite you to learn more by touring one of our facilities. Hopefully you’ll then apply for admission, which is granted without discrimination or regard to race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, or religion.

Trained professionals work individually and in group settings with your child to help them meet their developmental milestones and prepare them for success in school, and life.

The parent is recognized as the child's primary teacher, so we strive to keep parents involved in their child's development while encouraging parent/child interactions. On-site parent discussion rooms are available where educators and parents meet regularly to discuss the progress and needs of the child.   

The center serves the surrounding community and is also available for the children of students, staff, and faculty at Highline Community College, and is accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children.";"http://www.chs-wa.org/Our_Locations/Seattle_-_King_County/Early_Learning_Center_at_Highline.html";"https://www.facebook.com/CHSWashington";"Monday - Friday

Learning Land’s philosophy is to promote a positive sense of self in each child by developing interpersonal relationships combined with a loving and nurturing environment.  Our educator’s provide learning experiences that promote independence, social-emotional, physical, language, and cognitive skills.  Our curriculum is based on the whole child and emerges out of each child’s interests and personal needs.  We believe this approach to curriculum development engages the child in the learning experience and incorporates individual backgrounds and cultures.  Research shows that young children learn primarily through play.  During play children feel the freedom to explore new ideas and practice early learning skills.  As teachers plan activities and provide opportunities for children to work and play together; children learn valuable social skills and self-empowerment. These experiences positively affect their growth and learning throughout the rest of their lives.

We believe that families are the most important part of a child’s foundation. Effective communication between parents and teachers builds a level of trust, comfort, and enables us to make sure every child can be successful by reaching their full potential.  At Learning Land we engage our families in their child’s learning experience with parent-teacher conferences for preschool children and daily notes for toddlers and infants. We also have quarterly parent events that offer free childcare, dinner, and guest speakers as well as a yearly family Barbeque.  We are proud to offer these community based events at no additional charge.";"http://learninglandchildcare.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://learninglandchildcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Learning-Land-Learning-Center-Logo-2-011.png";;;;;;

The Montessori preschool teacher as a keen observer, guides the child at the right moment to allow the child to develop to their fullest potential.

In our preschool and kindergarten environment, we will help the child fulfill his inner need for knowledge. This in turn helps the child self-construct his character and intellect while integrating his mind, body and spirit. Maria Montessori discovered through her studies that “Please help me to do it myself” is the inner voice of the child.

We provide preschoolers with a warm, beautiful, loving, home-like environment, which is protective and secure, where the day unfolds in a predictable, regular way.

Over time, this foundational idea grew to become a multi-site organization known for its quality childcare and for its leadership in advancing best practices in all aspects of its operation.

At present, Kids Co. offers before school and after school care, preschool programming, and summer day-camp for children ages 3 to 12, and has ten centers conveniently located on the grounds of Seattle and Greater Seattle area public schools.

The organization reflects the spirit and vision of its founders, Susan R. Brown and Elaine Matthes, in its aim to create engaging communities for kids that families can trust. The importance of trust is at the heart of all that we do. It shapes who we recruit and hire, how we interact with kids and families, and how we support the communities and schools where we are located. It even shapes how we treat one another.

Fundamentally, childcare is a profession of cultivating healthy, life-engaging relationships. We believe that in helping children discover their gifts, explore the world and make life-long friends, we help families in our community thrive for generations to come. Kids Co. frontline childcare professionals design curriculum that supports this ultimate aim, programming that is creative, fun and tailored to the unique needs of the kids and families they serve.

No family is ever turned away due to inability to pay, and Kids Co. strives to provide uninterrupted care for each child enrolled, because relationship disruptions can be devastating for kids—as well as for parents. Contributions to Kids Co. help underwrite the tuition assistance we provide to families experiencing financial distress.

Our Academy is a Russian day care where the curriculum is a blend of the Russian preschool system and the methods of Montessori, Doman, the family Nikitiny, etc.

Lessons are held in subgroups based on the children’s ages. Some of the things covered daily are Russian language, writing, basics of reading, mathematics, social studies, art, speech development, introduction to literature, gymnastics based on the methods of Zhelezova, and preparation for school. Music lessons are held 2 times a week; here, students are introduced to composers and their works, choir, learn how to play various musical instruments, and prepare for festivals. Individual grand piano lessons are held 1 time per week. Children have a class 1-ce a week with an artist, where they study the history of the arts, become familiarized with artists and their styles, and get to apply their lessons by creating works of art themselves. A speech therapist works with the students 2 times a week. They also have English lessons 2 times a week in preparation for school. All of the lessons are included in the price of tuition.

The lessons are structured like a fun game, which stimulates child development, increases curiosity and artistic abilities, activates the children’s drive to learn without being prompted to do so, and promotes the desire to be independent.

Our children go for walks 2 times a day. Here, they are encouraged to make observations, to participate in discussions, and to enjoy playing games that are both active and developmental. (We offer a covered playground for days with poor weather conditions.) We even have a vegetable garden!

The balanced meals that we provide 5 times a day are prepared daily using only the freshest organic products. Produce is delivered to us straight off the farms or from special stores.

We celebrate all birthdays and Russian holidays. Once every season, children put on a theatrical production for their parents and guests.";"http://sarodgini.com/index.php/en/contact-us/";;"8 a.m. to 6 p.m.";"http://sarodgini.com/index.php/en/about-en/documents/";"http://sarodgini.com/index.php/en/about-en/documents/";"http://sarodgini.com/index.php/en/about-en/documents/";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://sarodgini.com/files/1813/6476/9797/header-img.png";;;;;;

At Magic Lantern Montessori our approach to learning is child-centered. In order to encourage initiative and self-sufficiency, children choose by themselves the things that interest them within an inspiring, imaginative, but well-defined setting. The faculty and staff gently guide students toward their inherent talents and abilities.

Magic Lantern Montessori currently serves children ages 3 to 6 in our full-day program and ages 2 1/2 to 5 years in our half-day program. We focus on practical, hands-on learning experiences in the areas of science, math, language, and geography. The curriculum also highlights cooking, dramatic expression, music, movement, and arts and crafts, directed by teachers with special training in these fields. Our goals are to help build children’s self-esteem and nurture their development of social and emotional awareness͓ about themselves and others.

Equally strong as our commitment to children, is our commitment to community. Parents are an integral component in helping assure our mission is accomplished. Parents are responsible for supporting the ongoing administration and management of the program via committee participation, or by taking-on specific duties. Your child’s experience at Magic Lantern will be enhanced by your involvement in our community. Just as we seek to provide a nurturing environment for our children, our goals are to interact with one another with respect, acceptance, empathy and the recognition that we each have a valuable contribution.";"http://soundchildcare.org/magic-lantern-montessori/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sound-Child-Care-Solutions/274203788082";"Monday – Friday

Staff focus on holistically nurturing child development by providing a safe and healthy place to learn foundational skills, develop healthy, and build trusting relationships.
 
At the Y, we believe the values and skills learned early on are vital building blocks for quality of life and future success.  That’s why our after school programs are staffed with people with an education background who understand the cognitive, physical and social development of children. Our staff consists of Site Coordinators and Program Assistants who not only possess the education credits but experiences in working with children. Staff are required through the Department of Early Learning to have a portable background check, CPR/First Aid and Blood Borne Pathogens trainings. Site Coordinators must have 30 college credits in school age education or related field. The staff maintain children in a safe environment, keeping them connected and supported in trying new things as well as demonstrating a caring nature and using positive reinforcement. Most importantly, children learn how to be their best selves. That makes for confident kids today and contributing and engaged adults tomorrow.
 
The YMCA of the Palouse after school programs operate in partnership with Pullman School District that enables our organization to provide children with a safe and familiar after school environment that supports character development, continuing education, and self-discovery.
 
The program has a consistent daily schedule that consists of a healthy snack, academic time, regular service learning opportunities and special curriculum-based experiences based on the YMCA's four core values. Our programs align with the Pullman School District so they run during teacher conferences/collaboration days and some holidays, out of convenience for parents. During longer days, staff plan days built around themes, provide a field trip in the community, have guest speakers, and other fun activities.
 
Our programs align under HEPA standards (healthy eating and physical activity) where the Y focuses on healthy food options, physical activities, limit screen time and offer information to families about healthy lifestyle choices. The Y operates three elementary school age after school programs; at Franklin, Jefferson, and Sunnyside Elementary. The after school programs run Monday through Friday from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM. These programs serve over one hundred children, ages 5-12, during the school academic year.  Each program includes homework assistance as well as mentoring by collegiate and community volunteers.";"http://www.palouseymca.org/programs/elementary-after-school-programs.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-YMCA-at-Washington-State-University/165730330162811?sk=info&tab=page_info";;;"http://resources.razorplanet.com/512568-9728/829668_AfterSchoolProgram20152016RegistrationForm1.pdf";"http://resources.razorplanet.com/512568-9728/829674_ParentHandbookAfterSchool20152016.pdf";"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://www.palouseymca.org/templates/5075/img/theY_logo2.png";;;;;;
