It is a safe place for parents to leave their children, knowing they will be cared for and happy.  The Center is an extension of the home; the staff sees both parents and children as integral parts of the child care family.
Amy Pysher’s Child Care Center is not a babysitting service, but is an environment prepared by staff who knows how children grow and develop.  The staff are people who are interested in, and feel responsible for seeing that the day to day experiences of the children take place in an environment which promotes growth and learning.  People staff the Center with special training in the developmental process of children. 
Our staff, like the staff of any organization dealing with children, recognizes that this is an educational force.  Each person on the staff serves as an example to the children, since children learn by observing as much as by being “taught”.  Parents in the home teach the same way.  We encourage a child to be a child….play, learn, grow, discover, and make choices.  The secure learning environment, created by a staff of professionals, encourages a child to develop a strong sense of self-esteem as he or she grows within a personal level of comfort.
Amy Pysher’s childcare Center welcomes any child regardless of race, religion, sex, ancestry, special needs or national origin.  Our policies and curriculum provide for equal care and attention to all children entrusted to us.
We are an early learning center for children ages 1 month to 12 years old.

Our staff is trained in first aid, cardio pulmonary resuscitation, fire safety as well as continuing their education with twelve hours of courses per year.  The directors on staff complete thirty hours of study each year.  All staff completed clearances including, but not limited to, FBI fingerprints, child abuse and criminal reports.  Our center accepts all child care subsidy programs.

    It is our mission to provide a secure setting for childcare for children from infants to prekindergarten.  We strive for an environment where children can acquire and develop the socialization skills and basic education to prepare them for their entrance to the Elementary School experience while promoting interaction with their peers and adults and experiencing the enjoyment of being a child.  Our staff is dedicated to the children and working with them in groups and one to one to maximize their skills and potential.

Serving a highly diverse community that is 47% African-American, 21% white, 18% Asian-American, 15% Hispanic, 8% other races, and 5% two or more races, we understand that the challenges will not only be difficult, but also abundant and unique.

Since the early 80’s, we have helped thousand of individuals, families, and businesses in our community overcome a countless number of obstacles, whether it be purchasing a first home, facing foreclosure, becoming a certified technician, finding a quality childcare center, or assisting struggling businesses in obtaining more funding. A major factor behind our success is that we value the diversity not only found in our community but also found in our staff.

Our goal is to provide an atmosphere that promotes growth and understanding, while making learning fun for all.

We at Reading Rainbow Learning Center understand that children come from diverse back grounds, yet their common goal is being understood and loved. That's why we cater to families with diverse circumstances, with goals to service them all with custom solutions to their child care needs. We also recognize that when children are confronted with the illness of a sibling it's particularly stressing and often overwhelming to the child; because of having to spend many hours in a hospital seeing

their sibling in pain and having to deal with, what seems to be their parents showing more attention to their sibling than to them. When children attend Reading Rainbow Learning Center with such circumstances we help them to deal with their concerns. While allowing the parents to care for their ailing child without the concerns of entertaining the other child, or assisting them with things such as home work, and other activities children need for developmental growth.";"http://www.readingrainbowlearningcenter.net/contactus/";;"Monday thru Friday

The Foundation provides for the health and well-being of children ages birth through 12 who are medically-fragile, technology-dependent, or have been diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. We encourage and inspire this special population of children to reach for the highest possible goals – intellectually, socially and physically.

The Foundation operates Frankie’s World, a Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care Center or PPECC, licensed by the State of Pennsylvania. It opened on July 19, 2006, and is centrally located in Northern Liberties to be accessible to children from all parts of Philadelphia. When my daughter Frankie was a toddler on a ventilator in 2000, she was isolated at home with a nurse, and there was no medically-safe place for her to go to make friends and learn about the world. We made Frankie’s World into the kind of place she would have loved.

Our state-of-the-art facility is staffed by experienced pediatric nurses and special needs educators. The interior is a large open playroom, equipped with toys, books, games, computers, adapted seating, therapy equipment, tricycles, indoor swing set, and much more – every item carefully selected to maximize a child's opportunity for physical, physiological, and intellectual growth and development. Nursing services include tracheotomy/ventilator care, g-tube feedings, medication administration, and seizure monitoring. There is no cost to parents – we will work with your child's doctor and insurance company.

Frankie's World is a safe and loving environment where children can play, learn and thrive while their parents are away at work or school. The Foundation's Staff and Board of Directors are dedicated to making Frankie's World a welcome solution for Philadelphia familes.";"http://www.frankiesworlddaycare.com/contact.cfm";;;"http://www.frankiesworlddaycare.com/jobs.cfm";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.frankiesworlddaycare.com/images/section_2.jpg";"http://www.frankiesworlddaycare.com/gallery/frankie%27s%20world%20106.jpg";"http://www.frankiesworlddaycare.com/gallery/Jayden.JPG";"http://www.frankiesworlddaycare.com/images/section_8.jpg";;

Our goal is to provide an atmosphere that promotes growth and understanding, while making learning fun for all.

We at Reading Rainbow Learning Center understand that children come from diverse back grounds, yet their common goal is being understood and loved. That's why we cater to families with diverse circumstances, with goals to service them all with custom solutions to their child care needs. We also recognize that when children are confronted with the illness of a sibling it's particularly stressing and often overwhelming to the child; because of having to spend many hours in a hospital seeing

their sibling in pain and having to deal with, what seems to be their parents showing more attention to their sibling than to them. When children attend Reading Rainbow Learning Center with such circumstances we help them to deal with their concerns. While allowing the parents to care for their ailing child without the concerns of entertaining the other child, or assisting them with things such as home work, and other activities children need for developmental growth.";"http://www.readingrainbowlearningcenter.net/contactus/";;"Monday thru Friday

Our programs are NAECY-certified and have achieved a Keystone 4-STAR rating. 

The goal of our early childhood education programs is to promote the cultural, cognitive, social, emotional and physical development of young children.  Each child has the opportunity to experience programs that feature age-appropriate developmental learning and enrichment activities, ensuring that children reach their fullest potential while in our care.  We place a strong emphasis on parent involvement and on positive reinforcement, thereby building children's self esteem in a safe and caring environment.  Our staff is highly capable and works successfully with children diagnosed with developmental disabilities. 

At APM, each classroom is led by experienced bilingual (English/Spanish) and bicultural teachers and assistants with formal training.  We require that all staff participate in continuous training opportunities, ensuring that the latest child development research tools are applied in our curriculum.

On September 28, 1951, the Methodist Homes for the Aged was incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania.

Building on this work, the Reverend Dr. Russell Hawke, Superintendent of the Scranton District of the Wyoming Conference, helped establish a small home for the elderly that would accommodate 20 to 25 residents, planned to be the first of many. As funds became available, the Methodist Homes for the Aging of the Wyoming Conference in the State of New York was incorporated in 1958, for the purpose of expanding the program to the Binghamton and Oneonta Districts.

On February 3, 1958, the Trustees purchased a home located at 1760 North Washington Street in Scranton for $38,000. A Board of Directors was established for the purpose of managing and operating the proposed Scranton Home. The Scranton home was opened in January of 1959, housing six residents. The Scranton Home remained in operation until 1974, with 10 individuals in residence relocating to the new Hilltop Campus in Johnson City, NY, which opened in March of that year.

A second home was generously donated by Mrs. Delphine Garrett of Philadelphia. The facility was named Murray-Tufts-Garrett Manor in honor of her mother, her grandfather, and her. She also established a significant endowment, which made it possible to build a series of additions to the facility. The new addition was occupied in 1965.";"http://www.unitedmethodisthomes.org/about-us/history/";"https://www.facebook.com/UnitedMH/info";;"http://www.unitedmethodisthomes.org/employment/";"http://www.unitedmethodisthomes.org/contact-admissions/admissions/";;"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";;"http://www.unitedmethodisthomes.org/wp-content/themes/umh-v0.0/images/content/pages/about-us_history.jpg";;;;;

At the core of our philosophy, we believe that each child is unique and therefore deserves individual attention and care. Because of their innate curiosity, it is up to us  at Yolanda's Kid Corner to develop suitable activities based on our observations of each child's individual needs.

Our curriculum reflects this comprehensive and highly individualized approach. Kids are divided into different groups during one part of the day in an effort to provide them with developmentally appropriate activities. At other times, children of all ages play together in order to learn from one another – the younger ones as learners, the older kids as role models.

In addition to the basic skills required for a lifetime of learning, Yolanda's Kid Corner imparts values such as creativity, self-reliance, compassion and respect for diversity. In order to achieve this goal, it is essential for us to work closely with you, the parents, to provide the best possible situation for your children.";"http://www.yolandaskidscorner.com/contact/";;"Monday - Friday

We are an equal opportunity provider. We believe that children must first feel emotionally and physically secure to be able to explore and learn from their environment. We are concerned with all aspects of children’s growth:  social, emotional, cognitive and physical.  We plan our program at each development level to provide opportunities for children to try new things both individually and in groups, make new friends and have fun. Activities are provided in the classrooms, outdoors, in the gym and on trips.  Our toys are kept on open shelves for easy accessibility to children.  In group activities, we recognize  that each child is an individual and we encourage children to express themselves according to their own personalities through art, music, circle time, body movement, games, imaginary play, block play, book time and cooking.  We set limitations primarily with regard to the safety of all children.  We try to teach children to respect each other’s person as well as their feelings and introduce children to the diversity found in society. We attempt to structure the classroom and activities in a way, which allows choice and flexibility within the security of a consistent schedule and pattern of expectations.  We encourage parents to get involved in our program, make suggestions and ask questions.";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/index.php?id=45";;"7:30am-6:00pm Monday through Friday";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/index.php?id=43";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/fileadmin/cspdocs/forms/Application_Form-Childspace_Too.pdf";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/fileadmin/cspdocs/forms/Childspace_Too_Handbook.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/fileadmin/images/Childspace_Too_665.gif";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/typo3temp/pics/6b17324576.jpg";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/typo3temp/pics/e240953cc3.jpg";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/typo3temp/pics/e38a156328.jpg";"http://csptoo.childspacedaycarecenters.org/typo3temp/pics/ee55861207.jpg";;

The beginning of the school year is spent getting to know each child, and introducing each child to his/her peers. At first, the child can acquire a knowledge of the physical world of the school environment. As each child develops an awareness of the environment, he/she will feel comfortable and secure.

The program is structured; yet, an open atmosphere prevails throughout the day. Your child will be involved in many activities, such as, group discussions, designated story time, finger-plays, songs, rhythm activities, dramatic play, large muscle activities to develop coordination, and arts and craft projects. The children will participate in learning experiences that are important to their growth and social development. They will explore areas that are important to early childhood education; reading readiness, math readiness, social studies, science, computers, music, art, physical education, social sensitivity, health and safety.

Hopefully, each child will grow and develop positive attributes in social, emotional, and intellectual aspects. Each child will be given the opportunity to be independent, to share responsibility, and to discover for themselves their special talents and abilities.

The children will develop an awareness of others’ feelings, ideas, and needs as well as their own. They will be given opportunities to give and share attention as well as receive it.

The children will also be exposed to programs and field trips which will be informative, entertaining, and an extension and strengthening of their skills.

For a child, the pre-school experience should be a happy transition between home and school. A new world is opening where there are new friends, new experiences, challenges, and the delightful sense of being with children in the same age group.

The children will receive three evaluations during the school year, which contain desired goals to be achieved according to the Pennsylvania Early Learning Standards. Please always remember that children mature at their own rate.";"https://www.facebook.com/carealotlearningcenterllc?v=info";"https://www.facebook.com/carealotlearningcenterllc?v=info";;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"https://scontent-a-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1384272_610091672363676_1605908755_n.jpg?oh=29df3bd82170c4aa67fb3666f0ea64d1&oe=548DBA0A";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1017272_610091279030382_726360240_n.jpg?oh=b9c988cbf39827f471ec5b94d441ba91&oe=5483612E&__gda__=1418301395_d079e7346b941c0a934adb0b79cfc1c0";"https://scontent-a-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1382165_610090925697084_1338936708_n.jpg?oh=6e415a140fbf9fa734dfd85edcdc48a2&oe=5482E13B";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/304107_273306982708815_912297177_n.jpg?oh=a09fbfd0b2d554524c9f765b65c6409d&oe=54CAB6D5&__gda__=1422537354_2afe870927b15abedf50e8d3df00d14c";;

Early childhood years are a very special time in your child’s development. We are excited to become a part of this learning experience.

Kai’s Comfy Corner has been in operation since 2002. We were founded to fulfill an increasing need for quality childcare in our area. We have a diverse group of children and staff. We provide a quality, age appropriate curriculum that fosters a child’s total self, teaching them self-confidence, self-awareness, self-control and self-respect, while embracing and celebrating the differences in us all.

Kai’s Comfy Corner is a state licensed facility and is Keystone Stars accredited. We believe each child is a unique individual and we are sensitive to their social, emotional, physical and cognitive development. Our program focuses on the process of learning and helping children enjoy successful experiences. We encourage not just learning, but “the love of learning”.

At Kai’s Comfy Corner our philosophy is ""Laugh. Play. Learn."" Our center is a place where children are allowed to be children, to explore their world using their imagination, and to feel loved and cared for in a safe and healthy environment.

Our teachers are creative and caring individuals who are dedicated to the children in their care. They are supported with trainings, resources and the freedom to create unique learning experiences for our children. They strive to create a partnership with parents and guardians who we believe are the most significant adults in a child’s life. Their goal is to make sure your child is equipped with the knowledge and social skills needed to have a successful start.

Our Center is enhanced by the latest state of the art security video surveillance and an electronic buzz in security door. We have an onsite gated playground with jungle gym and safety surfacing for daily outdoor play and a parking lot for convenient drop off and pickups.";"http://comfycorner.org/";;"6:30 A.M. – 6:30 P.M.

It is Tolentine’s goal to provide an opportunity for all constituents within our catchment area to develop their full potential as productive members of society while at the same time creating a better community in which to work and live.
 Tolentine’s community-based programs have been designed with the needs of our target population in mind. The Community Center building provides a central place for the wider community to meet, interact positively together and participate in a broad range of programs and activities. We have developed a strong expertise in providing services to children and youth through the Tolentine After School program which has been in operation since 1995. 
Tolentine Community Center has a range of other programs specifically targeting youth and young adults in our catchment area, some 2,000 of whom are served each year through the Tolentine Center Youth Program.";"http://tolentinecommunitycenter.org/";;;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;"http://tolentinecommunitycenter.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/BackRoom1.124165027_std.JPG";"http://tolentinecommunitycenter.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Gym.57154634_std.jpg";"http://tolentinecommunitycenter.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/FrontYard2.57152340_std.JPG";"http://tolentinecommunitycenter.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/BackRoom2.124165341_std.JPG";;

Families need assistance in many areas and we are equipped to meet their needs through quality care and referral services. Quality is measured in many ways in early childhood.

We have a safe and clean building, with security in place to keep our children safe. Our only public entrance is locked tight with a Secured Door Fingerprint Entrance. We do internal inspections weekly of our classroom, supplies, and the general building.

Education is the most important part of our vision and our main key to quality. Our director is pursuing a PhD in Early Childhood Education. Each employee is encouraged and enabled to take higher education courses by paid release time and paid tuition. Every course that is studied and each workshop attended brings a greater level of understanding to the staff. This understanding provides our client, the children, with child care workers who know how the child's mind works and how to best serve this young population.

Classes also provide our staff with a high level of professionalism. This helps us to provide support the the wide variety of family issues that arise in our center. We take pride in our education of our children. We are a Head Start center and a center that is rising in the ratings of STARS; currently we are at 3 of a possible 4. We will continue that pursuit to the highest level.

Our faith-based statues allows us to minister to our families in unique ways.

It is my hope that these pages will provide an easy way for parents and students to access information about our school. You will find electronic copies of our latest newsletters and lunch menus at the left side of this page. Upcoming events, links to teacher websites, and other useful information can also be found here.

We have a big job to do; we are all helping to build kids’ futures right now. The skills they learn, the habits they acquire, and the attitudes they develop about relationships and hard work will be carried on to junior high school, high school, and beyond. Now is our best chance to help our children be ready. This endeavor is something that best happens as a partnership between students, parents, and the school. And I am grateful that our students and schools have the support of parents and the Coudersport community at large.

Our school has a solid reputation for student achievement and growth in the core academic areas, the arts, and physical education. We have talented and caring teachers and staff who are truly concerned about the wellbeing of our students. Together, we have an opportunity to improve on our already strong reputation and help our kids be ready to meet the changing needs of society.

Student safety, learning, and growth are our top priorities, and those concerns are reflected in our four basic student expectations: being safe, being responsible, being respectful, and being kind.  We have great students at our school, and I intend to do my part to help each one reach his or her potential.  With the help of their parents and our faculty and staff, I am confident that they will be able to do that.";"http://coudersport.schoolwires.com/coudersportes/site/default.asp";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

    At Tiny Treasures, we believe that all children are individuals and should be treated as such. We concentrate on school readiness at age appropriate levels for each child. Each child will work at their own pace to maximize their learning capabilities. We recognize that each child has unique personalities and learning styles. Our teachers are qualified individuals with years of experience and are nurturing to each child. Our teachers are committed to early childhood education at Tiny Treasures therefore you will see the consistent, patient, kind, loving, nurturing teachers day after day, month after month, year after year. We feel consistency with the teachers and children is a vital role in the success of your child's development. 
    One of our goals that we strive for is to produce a child care facility that becomes a place that the children want to come to on a daily basis; a place where the children feel safe and secure with their teachers. By doing this we collaborate with the families to include them in this early learning experience with their child.  A daily report will be sent to communicate your child's activities throughout the day.  We do assessments on the children in the Fall and Spring. Parent conferences upon request are held to share the goals that they have reached and what we are striving to conquer for next time.  Families are invited throughout the year to many events that we host at our centers.  Our monthly newsletters are sent to inform the families of curriculum, and exciting new events that will occur.

The program is certified through the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, and STAR FOUR designated by the Office of Child Development Keystone STARS program. We are housed in a facility designed specifically for young children, fully renovated in 2007.

Our center is located on Henderson Avenue, behind Lowry’s Western Shop. The program is staffed with qualified and experienced teachers who have or are pursuing Child Development Associate degrees, associate’s or bachelor’s degrees in early childhood education or related fields. College students serve as teacher aides & substitutes during the summer months. Most of these students are majoring in education related fields. All staff participate in on-going professional development activities.

The teachers provide a developmentally appropriate curriculum within a learning environment, fostering growth in the areas of cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and linguistic development. The curriculum is child-centered and play-based with learning activities designed to meet each child’s individual ability, developmental stage, and area of interest. Each day is made up of a balance of active, quiet, individual, and group activities along with morning and afternoon snacks, hot meals, and rest/nap time.

Part-time as well as full-time child care is available. A child must be enrolled a minimum of three days per week. Infants are accepted at a full time rate, regardless of attendance, due to limited space and low student/teacher ratio. Part time enrollments are accepted on a limited basis. Once Upon A Time participates in the Department of Agriculture's Child and Adult Care Food Program, Providing nutritious meals and snacks at no extra charge.

We encourage the development of critical thinking skills, creativity, imagination and self-expression.

The center provides an enviroment that is safe, nuturing and developmentally stimulating.  It promotes the physical, social, emotional and cognitive development of the children, while also responding to the needs of the whole family.

The school is home to approximately 575 students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  Students enjoy the benefit of an average class size of 22.8 students. Most Red Mill teachers possess or are working towards advance degrees in their field.  Red Mill teachers annually participate in staff development academies, which provide opportunities for professional growth and training. Through their participation in these academies, the staff continually improves their skills, strategies, and techniques for enhancing teaching and learning thus creating an enhanced learning environment for all students.

Red Mill provides a strong foundation in the basic skills with an integrated language arts approach to reading, writing, spelling, listening, and speaking.  In the primary grades, our Kid Writing and Writing Process approach enables students, kindergarten through second, to move through the stages of writing development, to increase their vocabulary, and to improve their writing ability more rapidly.  Sequential development of number concepts and computation is strengthened with an emphasis on critical thinking skills, problem solving strategies, and hands-on learning in mathematics.  The curriculum provides opportunities for incorporating both enrichment and accelerated activities to meet individual student needs. Academically, the children at Red Mill achieve at or above expected levels in every area on District-wide assessments and the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment.

Technology skills are taught through an integrated approach in the classroom.  The classroom teachers plan and teach lessons which utilize technology in all grades. This effort is supported by 5 laptop computer carts, digital movie and still cameras, in-focus projectors, iPads, and supervised Internet access.  In addition, most of the kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms are equipped with an interactive white board.  The library contains an up-to-date and extensive collection of children’s literature and reference materials, an automated card catalog system, inter-library loan capability, and each student receives weekly instruction in lifelong literacy skills.

Students at Red Mill have the opportunity to expand their talents and skills through specialized classes in art, music, library, and physical education.  String and band instrument instruction begins in the fourth grade.  All students at Red Mill are able to participate in a variety of activities, including instrumental and choral performances, school spirit days, community service projects, TEAM, and Junior Achievement lessons. After-school clubs and tutoring opportunities are available outside of the school day for selected children.

Parent participation is encouraged and welcomed at Red Mill. In fact, many parents and grandparents volunteer in a variety of ways every day.  The Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) provides resources for field trips, assemblies, after-school programs, and daily planners for every student.  A group of dedicated and energetic volunteers form the PTO, making a significant contribution to the total school experience for Red Mill’s children.

We have 20 well trained staff members, five of whom have four-year degrees. We offer full and part time care for babies from 6 weeks old to school age children up to 12 years old, between the hours of 6:30 AM and 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We offer a Preschool Program, a Kindergarten Program, a Before-School Program, an After-School Program, a Before-and-After-School Program and a Summer-Program.

We have a baby room with only four babies, unlike many large New Cumberland daycare centers which have as many as 12 to 16 babies in one room. Our Young toddler room has between 10 and 12 children between the ages of 1 and 2 years and has three staff members. Our Older Toddler Room has between 12 and 18 children between the ages of 2 to 3 years and has three to four staff members. Our Center serves Etters, Newberrytown, York Haven, Lewisberry and  Fishing Creek childcare and has three Preschool Rooms. The First two are limited to 10 children each, and are used as a transition between the Toddler Rooms and a more classroom like environment. The final Preschool Room is for children who will be attending Kindergarten the following year and is run like a classroom at school, with a maximum of 24 children. Unlike a classroom at school, our large Preschool Room has Two Teachers with Elementary Education Degrees, one of which has ten years teaching experience and the other has over twenty. These two teachers also have an assistant. In this way, we are able to fully prepare your child for school.

We have a Kindergarten Program with between 12 and 18 children and two staff members. The Kindergarten children have their own building with two separate floors. The first floor is set up as a recreation room area with everything from pool and ping-pong, to air-hockey and skee-ball. The second floor is set up as a classroom environment with two large classrooms and a computer resource area. The entire third floor of this building is our storage for education and craft resources, which all the staff access. We have more in resources in this area than are typically stored at ten of our competitors combined.

We have two full size school buses with which we transport our kindergarteners and school age children to and from school. We also use these buses to go on field trips throughout the year with all our children four years and older. We use our school buses to transport our school age children in our School Age Summer Program on four to five field trips per week (see the list of field trips scheduled for 2012 under the Summer Program tab above). You will also notice that preschool children four years and older go on approximately two field trips each week to parks all summer long.";"http://www.whalesnail.com/";;"6:30 AM to 6:00 PM";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.whalesnail.com/files/QuickSiteImages/3005e_image_402x252.jpg";"http://www.whalesnail.com/100_8592.JPG";"http://www.whalesnail.com/publishImages/Photo-Gallery~~element56.JPG";"http://www.whalesnail.com/publishImages/Photo-Gallery~~element57.JPG";;

We respect and view each child as a unique personality and the most important person in our environment.

Our goal at a child’s place Montessori School is to assist children to reach their fullest potential as healthy, creative, constructive members of a community and to joyfully cultivate a genuine desire for life-long learning.  Part of that assistance is to work closely with the parents, to respect the individual child and his or her needs, and to nurture the qualities of independence, warmth, imagination, honesty, grace and resilience.

a child's place believes that social, racial, religious and cultural diversity in the student body contributes greatly to the value of the school experience. It therefore does not discriminate in admission or placement on the basis of sex, race, religion, disability, creed or national origin.

Our center has 3 developmentally-appropriate play areas for the children.  Inside you’ll find bright, cheerful classrooms for learning centers and play.

As part of our healthy living standards and involvement in the Let’s Move initiative, Play and Learn Hatboro provides enrichment gym and music programs as part of the curriculum.  Outside specialists in sports and music join us twice a month and always bring a smile to the children’s faces.  In addition, supplemental activity and learning programs are offered to families throughout the year.

Play and Learn Hatboro offers a full-day Kindergarten licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.  A small class size allows for children to spend more one on one time with the teacher and develop the appropriate skills necessary for their transition to public or private elementary school.

You can have confidence that your child is well supervised and learning in our K-Plus Program, developed to accommodate children who attend a public or private half-day kindergarten program.  Busing to and from Crooked Billet Elementary is available at Hatboro Play and Learn.

For your convenience, Play and Learn Hatboro offers a low-cost lunch program. This optional program may be perfect to ease your busy schedule.

We are an equal opportunity care provider, welcoming children of all faith traditions to our non-denominational programs!

Our purpose is to develop the whole child through loving, caring, sharing, forgiving, and growing in relation to others. Our teachers support the social and emotional growth of each child, while stimulating their intellectual development and early learning. We balance teacher directed activities with child initiated activities, and offer children the playtime they need to learn and grow while interacting with their peers.

Both indoor and outdoor play areas are available to provide opportunities for physical development in all kinds of weather. A toddler play space was recently enclosed outside the Playcare classrooms, and a brand-new playground for children ages 2-5 was installed in Nov, 2010!

Our Pre-School and Playcare programs for children ages one to five are offered from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, from mid-September through mid-June. A summer program is offered separately from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM for about 10 weeks starting in mid-June. Traditional schedules include Monday through Friday, Monday/Wednesday/Friday, and Tuesday/Thursday. Customized schedules are granted, when possible, to assist parents in meeting the needs of their work schedules.";"http://www.glensideucc.org/preschool.aspx";;"8:00 AM to 5:30 PM";;"http://www.glensideucc.org/2014-2015%20REGISTRATION%20FORM.pdf";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.glensideucc.org/images/banner/41474081.jpg";;;;;;

Fast forward 30 years to the present day, and Toni and her staff have positively affected the lives of hundreds of children.

Watoto - Swahili for the word “child,” is a different kind of aftercare program.

Part of the Watoto difference is our deep commitment to your child's educational future. Aftercare is our primary focus – not an add-on service to a daycare or preschool.
 
We are primarily staffed with aspiring teachers who have a true interest in nurturing each child's physical, social, emotional and intellectual development. We focus on homework help, themed enrichment and experience-based learning clubs. Students are given time each day to complete homework assignments and participate in theme-based activities that encourage community service, character growth and hands-on learning.
 
Our bi-annual showcase is presented at each host school at the end of each term and we share our learning with parents, friends and the greater school community. There is a gallery walk for students to display their works in addition to performances from our music, modeling and/or martial arts club members.";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/";;;;"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/index.php/for-parents/registration-form";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home1.JPG";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home2.JPG";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home3.JPG";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home5.JPG";;

At Clementine Montessori, we welcome families and children into a peaceful and nurturing community.

When you walk into our classrooms, what you will observe is extraordinary–children exploring, talking, learning, engaging in work that is meaningful to them.  What you will feel is striking–the calmness, respect, and sense of pride emanating from the children.

Our teachers exude a warmth that is palpable.  We care deeply for the social, emotional, and cognitive growth of each child.  At Clementine, a child’s question is met with an invitation to explore and discover, rather than an answer.

What sets Clementine Montessori apart from other schools is how we meet the individual needs of every child through careful attention to our classroom environments, the learning materials used, and our relationships with children and families.

At Clementine, our youngest citizens learn how to learn, solve problems, focus on the task at hand, and work together as a community.  And of course, they sing songs, create artistic masterpieces, and play together.  They are children after all.";"http://www.clementinemontessori.org/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Clementine-Montessori/174391242575603";;;"http://www.clementinemontessori.org/admissions/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10369969_918266611521392_6319342650205730868_n.jpg?oh=b27e5b25da6342669c32c6874df58cb5&oe=54C8FB65&__gda__=1418596056_54c8c7043d9588cddb4afd977722b344";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10178146_918266494854737_6292713473567596070_n.jpg?oh=cdab831aa449840be6a87f0666662998&oe=54852071&__gda__=1418761519_030a117c099675e94efcc22be4afe4e6";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10671405_908861499128570_354927852338709655_n.jpg?oh=a06eb71011695a7dcd998815fdb70684&oe=54BC7018&__gda__=1422953423_7ccd58ec77e1be0a703faff4a206f382";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10492042_879521532062567_5674902511478438718_n.jpg?oh=9b99ade677e5a055ce8bd19b75c94ebd&oe=54923529&__gda__=1421893621_118165a9611ce3cb78d9684d788ce2b3";;

* For the child to develop concepts and problem solving ability
* For the child to relate positively to other people based on mutual understanding and acceptance of another person's point of view

It is a place where children see just how amazing learning can be; setting a passionate foundation for education that will support them throughout their lives. More than just another Pittsburgh daycare, Tender Care Learning Centers uses a holistic approach to education that shows children how fun it can be to learn. While we do offer Pittsburgh child care services, our approach would not be given due justice with such an overall label.

Tender Care Learning Centers are a member of the larger family that is Bradford Child Care Services. Since 1982, Bradford Child Care Services has been setting the bar in early education, and their approach is supported by the more than 2,000 families that sign their children up for classes in three states. While a traditional Pittsburgh day care may offer very basic services to the children they enroll, Tender Care Learning Centers provides some important extras that distinguish them from those other Pittsburgh day care centers.

We are not really a day care, but rather a child care center. While this may seem like nothing more than semantics to some, for us there is a major difference. Instead of just keeping your child busy while he or she is in our care, we support their educational and personal growth with proven educational tools.

We offer an environment that feels more like a home than a school. We understand that children learn best when they are comfortable and that they are more comfortable when they feel like they are home.

Our teachers are highly qualified, and our approach makes them more passionate at work. Since we give our instructors the freedom to be creative with the children, they get a higher level of personal satisfaction. The result: a child care center with instructors that have been with us for a decade or more in an industry with a very high turnover rate.

We look at parents as integral in our approach. By involving you in the education of your child as much as possible, we feel that we are further enhancing the ""homey"" feeling of our centers. We are very proud of the relationships that we maintain with our amazing parents, and we often learn a lot from their perspectives.

Our programs are age appropriate, and take into account the different learning paces of all children. We want our children to feel confident and free to create and explore, and this ""open ended"" approach we use helps to encourage that.";"http://www.earlyeducationpros.org/tendercare/locations.jsp";;;"http://www.earlyeducationpros.org/tendercare/careers.jsp";"http://www.earlyeducationpros.org/tendercare/enrollment.jsp";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Demand for daycare facilities continue to grow day by day, but all too often, institutions are only able to focus on either allowing the child to enjoy their childhood and develop naturally or forcing the child to focus only on mental development in order to achieve high test scores later on in life.

Caring Hands Learning Center is different. We promote physical activities in large open areas and a wide variety of educational games, but we also have a small library and various arts and crafts for your child to unleash his or her full creative and intellectual potential.

Our goal is to promote every child's development individually using an appropriate mix of academic and recreational activities.";"http://www.caringhandsofhershey.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/Caring.Hands.Learning.Center";"Monday - Friday

We are excited to begin a new partnership with Manheim Central School District this year!  Our program is operated in the school building which is secure and familiar to the students.

Before and after school we provide opportunities for school age children to feel supported, significant and challenged all in an environment that is relaxing and engaging. We encourage children to explore their interests in learning centers, interact with friends and find their passions. Children are empowered as they are an important part of the community that is created. They often will initiate our investigations. We know learning is more fun and is retained longer when it is relevant to the student.

We will participate in the Pennsylvania’s quality initiative program entitled Keystone STARS once the school year begins.  We also participate with CCIS.

We do offer services early dismissals and no school days.

The Upper School in Kingston is a day and boarding community with classes from grades nine through twelve plus a postgraduate year.

At the time of the school's founding in 1844 by the Methodist Church, ""seminary"" was a common name for school. To this day, Wyoming Seminary maintains a connection with the Methodist Church but accepts students of all faiths.

We offer a safe and nurturing environment that is both predictable and low stress. Our goal is to allow each child to grow and develop at their own pace using a variety of researched techniques to assist them in this process, making them productive members of a community of learners.

To assist us in this process, we have been chosen to be part of several exclusive programs offered to only a few centers throughout the four county area. These include; Success By Six (through United Way) and Mind in the Making – 2 programs that act as resources to help centers excel and maintain the highest possible quality in preschool programing.

As of October 1st, Early Years will be celebrating their first anniversary. Please join us for this celebration with an Open House here at the center on October 4, 2013 from 6:30 – 8:00 PM. Come see our facility, hear about our program, and meet the teachers. You will also have the chance to meet other parents and enjoy seasonal refreshments.

Please let us know if you are part of the La Salle family. You will receive a 10% discount off published tuition rates!

    The parent's role in the development of the child entrusted to us must be supported and reinforced through our program.
    There are certain basic values such as Honesty, Integrity, Caring, Concern, and Self-Esteem which must become part of our children if they are to function as responsible citizens of our society.
    Children will be encouraged to express their feelings and ideas to grow in self-confidence and independence.
    Knowledge of each child's background, needs, and interests will enable us to work more effectively with the child; the parent's input in this and all aspects of our program is very important.

    Our program will provide meaningful, personalized experiences, which will enhance the spiritual, emotional, physical, and cognitive growth development of the young child
    Everyday activities and routines have been designed to encourage the children learn self-help and independence.
    We are in the unique position of reaching the minds of our young. It is our desire and responsibility to cultivate and nourish those minds to their ultimate potential, as well as create a caring environment in which to learn.
    We believe very strongly that education is the cornerstone of society being able to flourish. We strive to make learning a pleasant and enjoyable experience for our children.

";"Thank you so much for showing an interest in having your child attend Grandview Montessori.  It is with great pleasure that we inform you about our program and what we have to offer your child.  We believe our program and approach will prepare students for their primary school years and provide them with the necessary tools to become life-long learners.  

Montessori education focuses on learning through concrete manipulation of objects and materials in a prepared learning environment.  Students are able to select works in the classroom that pique their interest and either choose to work on it independently or in collaboration with another child.  

The Reggio approach that we utilize in the afternoon portion of the day focuses on group projects and collective learning with all subject areas being integrated.  

The Montessori and Reggio pedagogies stem from the same philosophies of learning and blend extremely well together, stressing the student as the builder of knowledge and the teacher as a facilitator.  They are both designed to provide opportunities for each child to grow and experience social awareness, emotional well-being, physical development, and academic pursuits.

The scope of this vision requires the Office of Early Childhood Education to increase and maintain its authentic, working partnerships within the School District of Philadelphia as well as among state and city government agencies, businesses, non-profit institutions, community organizations, and parents. As we work together rather than separately, we will be able to identify and prioritize a shared definition of the needs of Philadelphia’s families and young children. We then can proceed to systematically plan and implement programs that most effectively use human, financial, and programmatic resources to meet these needs.

Watoto - Swahili for the word “child,” is a different kind of aftercare program.

Part of the Watoto difference is our deep commitment to your child's educational future. Aftercare is our primary focus – not an add-on service to a daycare or preschool.
 
We are primarily staffed with aspiring teachers who have a true interest in nurturing each child's physical, social, emotional and intellectual development. We focus on homework help, themed enrichment and experience-based learning clubs. Students are given time each day to complete homework assignments and participate in theme-based activities that encourage community service, character growth and hands-on learning.
 
Our bi-annual showcase is presented at each host school at the end of each term and we share our learning with parents, friends and the greater school community. There is a gallery walk for students to display their works in addition to performances from our music, modeling and/or martial arts club members.";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/";;;;"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/index.php/for-parents/registration-form";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home1.JPG";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home2.JPG";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home3.JPG";"http://www.watotoafterschool.com/new/images/yootheme/demo/gallery/home5.JPG";;

Our guiding principles are systemic in approach, grounded in research, and are characterized by significant levels of parent involvement and community support. The Office of Early Childhood Education looks forward to the time when all Philadelphia children from birth to age six and their families receive the health, education, and social services and support needed for healthy development and educational success. The scope of this vision requires the Office of Early Childhood Education to increase and maintain its authentic, working partnerships within the School District of Philadelphia as well as among state and city government agencies, businesses, non-profit institutions, community organizations, and parents. As we work together rather than separately, we will be able to identify and prioritize a shared definition of the needs of Philadelphia’s families and young children. We then can proceed to systematically plan and implement programs that most effectively use human, financial, and programmatic resources to meet these needs. This united community, civic and social context sets the optimum conditions for providing high quality, comprehensive, developmentally appropriate programs and services to all of Philadelphia’s young children and their families.";"http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/e/earlychild";;;;"http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/e/earlychild/proposed-policies--procedures-structure/enrollment";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/uploads/_M/_e/_M_exrV0MbNddc0qxsEIPg/FAST.png";;;;;

Our goal is to provide an educational atmosphere that incorporates the Montessori Philosophy emphasizing development of your child’s body, mind and spirit. After years of careful observation and working with children, Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952) developed her philosophy that the child absorbs learning through experience. Montessori children learn through a process of discovery and given the proper environment their natural love of learning flourishes.  Teachers at Ithan Montessori strive to create a unique learning environment where children are encouraged to respect themselves, others and the environment.

Our classrooms provide a prepared environment where children are free to respond to their natural tendency to work.  Each child is free to choose to work alone or with another child. Working with a friend encourages cooperation and harmony.  If a child chooses to work alone, he or she learns to respect the other students in the classroom and knows not to disturb one another.  When a child finishes with his or her work, he or she returns each item to its appropriate place.

The children's innate passion for learning is encouraged by giving them opportunities to engage in spontaneous, purposeful activities with the guidance of a trained adult.  This approach allows the child to develop self-confidence, inner discipline and motivation.  The Montessori classroom and activities are child-directed, non-competitive and self-correcting.  As a result, each child experiences success rather than frustration, which in turn develops his or her sense of self-esteem and self-confidence and allows him or her to be self-motivated.

¡VÁMONOS! encourages families to embrace a second language. Leave it to us to give the gift of Spanish to your children. There is NO need to know Spanish. If you have the desire to give your child a life-long advantage of a second language and its benefits, ¡VÁMONOS! is the right place for you and your family. ¡VÁMONOS!offers age-appropriate curriculums in a Spanish immersion environment where children are listening to Spanish as a common part of their everyday activities. Children are more likely to learn and more importantly retain a second language by seeing it as a “normal” part of their day. Our staff is fully bilingual and will routinely emphasize Spanish while communicating.

At ¡VÁMONOS!, we strive to ensure that all children in our care are loved, nurtured and educated in a warm and relaxed atmosphere. We regard each child’s interests, pace of learning, and imagination as unique and important. ¡VÁMONOS! is an early childhood learning center that serves children ages six weeks to five years old. ¡VÁMONOS! daycare and preschool learning centers are committed to helping children obtain a strong foundation and maximum growth through the emotional, physical, social and cognitive areas. The environments in the classrooms are age appropriate and children are nurtured and encouraged to play, learn and explore.";"http://vamonoschildcare.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/VAMONOS.PA";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://vamonoschildcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Vamonos-logo-web-300x137.png";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1506734_664187973639866_1271017470_n.jpg?oh=e24e1c8f4cdb25bfced0f892fa047045&oe=54B8DD51&__gda__=1421864984_8886d863d9b9a717e1a0084431c6c298";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1653316_664187880306542_547649406_n.jpg?oh=2ac1ad6b06f6c17952130475357bd980&oe=54BA3431";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1601530_656403877751609_2023745617_n.jpg?oh=e045d5b59c328f1e1e538b48e29d089a&oe=54CC6C31&__gda__=1417849514_4977a892864b4c2a57a29873fe51fc81";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1012055_655896681135662_1029128020_n.jpg?oh=2176734238dcd1c77a8695a6ed1918c7&oe=54C5B95F&__gda__=1422990358_d1085389123e77ecbbdd91e14983a5f4";;
