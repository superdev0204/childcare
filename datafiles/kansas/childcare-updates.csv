With this goal in mind, we have been inspired by leaders of education, business, and health fields to create an educational program that not only prepares children for later success in school but also develops key skills which will serve children throughout life. Beyond creating academic achievement and life skills, we are committed to encouraging each child to develop as a unique individual.

Developmentally appropriate learning outcomes are met through opportunities and support for children to make decisions, take risks, develop compassion, work collaboratively as both a leader and a team player, persevere when challenged, take responsibility for their actions, and act with integrity. All of these attributes serve a person well throughout their school years as well as throughout life.

The activities enhance and challenge all areas of development -- physical, social, emotional, and intellectual. Parents are welcome throughout the day to feed and visit with the children. For infants, developing basic secure and trusting relationships is a primary task. Teachers foster this trust through frequent physical contact, sensitive responses to infants' signals, and mutual delight in interactions. For toddlers, daily experiences include simple art projects, dramatic play, and free play that encourages manipulation, imitation, and exploration. For all children through pre-school, social skills such as empathy, caring, and sharing are also emphasized through interactions with warm, responsible, and encouraging caregivers.

At KTU we provide a safe, fun, and loving educational environment, while giving each child the opportunity to explore the world at their own pace, incorporating the daily curriculum of reading, writing, math, music, science, and technology. KTU’s low staff to child ratios guarantee that each child will get the daily attention that they need. At Kiddie Tech University we know how difficult it can be for parents to find adequate care for their child and it is our mission to make parents feel completely comfortable that their child is in good hands at all times.";"http://www.kiddietechuniversity.com/";;;;"http://www.kiddietechuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kiddie-tech-APPLICATION-FOR-ADMISSION.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

    That the early years are the single most important period in the development of a person’s intelligence, and the child’s mind from birth through age six is extremely absorbent and should be properly nourished and stimulated.

We will strive to provide learning experiences that will accomodate all our students learning intelligences so that they may find academic success.

Philosophy
Our belief is that young children will thrive through their positive interactions with appropriate role models, exposure to developmentally appropriate materials and the introduction of educational concepts in a developmentally appropriate environment. The children enrolled in our program are involved in activities, based on play, that address their developmental needs in the following areas of growth: social, emotional, cognitive and physical.

We believe that it is the responsibility of all early childhood educational environments to provide, on a daily basis, challenging, age-appropriate experiences in order to foster a child's positive developmental growth.

Our idea of developmentally appropriate is a small classroom size (10 children), two qualified instructors, play-based learning and the individualization of lessons.  With this formula, we believe the optimum classroom environment is achieved for children of preschool age.   

 

The primary objective of our program is to provide a safe, caring, healthy and secure environment that promotes the emotional, physical, psychological and social growth of each child through developmentally appropriate practice.  This includes providing and/or referring parents and families to appropriate services to support and enhance these objectives as needed.

 

We are committed to supporting, honoring and incorporating cultural and linguistic diversity within the program.  We understand that all children develop at their own pace.  We try to individualize our lesson plans and daily activities to suit every child's needs. 

 

We are a nonprofit Child Care and School Readiness Program.  We are funded by the State Department of Education and the Connecticut Department of Social Services.  The center is licensed by the CT Department of Public Health and certified for food service by the North Central Health District.  The program is accredited by the National Association for Young Children (NAEYC).  We serve up to 28 children ages 3 years to 5 years from the towns of Vernon and Ellington; occassionally surrounding towns and is open to all children in those communities.  

​

The Staff consists of an Executive Director, a Head Teacher, 6 additional teaching staff and a cook.  Volunteers from UConn community programs also participate. A Board of Directors governs the policies and procedures of the center.  The Board consists primarily of current and former parent representatives but may include members from the community at large.

     Winsted Area Child Care Center, Inc. was founded in 1979 by three longtime preschool teachers, Penny Putnam, Ayreslea Denny and Lyn Haskell.  These ladies joined forces with some important community members who assisted them in transforming their dream into a reality.  In October of that year; with a little elbow grease, Winsted Area Public Day Care opened its doors on the lower level of the Temple Beth Israel at 74 Park Place in Winsted.  The site was licensed and soon thereafter became a United Way agency.
     The Center grew steadily in enrollment, staff and reputation.  In 1986 the Center became one of the first in Connecticut to become accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and has proudly maintained this status to this day.
     After the addition of Infants, Toddlers and School-Age programs, the Center changed its name to The Winsted Area Child Care Center, Inc. fondly referred to as WACCC.  After many years of fundraising, we moved to our current site in December of 2002 at 185 Prospect Street.  In 2005, our Before and After School Education program followed suit and opened a brand new site at 1 Lake Street.  Between our two locations, WACCC currently serves children from 6 weeks of age to 12 years.  Our license allows us to provide care for 112 infants, toddlers and preschoolers and 74 school-age children.

Our Center is filled with laughter, love and happiness.           
 
 Children at Northwood are exposed to many activities to meet the needs of the diverse population of children enrolled at the Center and in their community. All developmental, cultural and language differences are embraced at Northwood. Our Center has available to parents and staff, a written daily program which includes a flexible schedule.            
 Northwood Childcare Center’s Preschool Program consists of both free-choice time, as well as teacher-directed time. Indoor and outdoor activities, large motor time, quiet time, hands-on activities, cooking, health and nutrition, music and movement, and multi-cultural activities for the diverse population of children, are all emphasized.          
   Children are able to engage in many, fun, learning activities. These may include: science, math, both small and large motor skills activities, stringing beads, making and using play dough, building structures, constructing puzzles, and making nutritious snacks by doing supervised cooking activities. They can choose to participate in language activities, stories, cooperative play with their peers, or have quiet time.            
 The daily schedule is flexible to allow the teaching staff to use teachable moments. Teachable moments let the children’s interests guide, shape, and mold the preschool curriculum to better meet their needs. This makes it more enjoyable and provides a wonderful and exciting environment in which to thrive, learn and grow.            
 Our classrooms encompass many learning areas throughout the rooms. The teachers use the classroom spaces to set up and arrange (including but not limited to) a Dramatic Play Area, Science Center, Math Center, Writing Center, Quiet/Book Area, Circle Area, Blocks and Building Area, and an Art Center.           
  The children have opportunities to participate in dancing, singing, large motor games that include all children, throwing and catching balls and beanbags, plus color, letter and shape recognition games.             
Children involved in the School Age Programs have the opportunity to have a chance to relax and interact with their peers in a positive way, participate in team building games and activities, work on homework, read, draw, and most importantly, to have fun.          
  
 Northwood registration is open to children regardless of race, religion, or national origin.

Although the paint colors have changed along with a few familiar faces, owner Ann Maczpacay said much about the schoolâ€™s philosophy has remained. Graduating hundreds of students and even inspiring a few teachers, the school has always had a secret to success: TLC. â€œWe have a nice cozy feeling and we have fun, but we also have strong academics,â€ owner Ann Maczpacay said, describing what makes her school unique. With just 24 students per session, Maczpacay said her students get personalized attention from teachers throughout the day. The close-knit group of students and teachers forms a second family for her students, she said. â€œWe have a closeness with the families that they really appreciate,â€ preschool Director Fred Fuller agreed. â€œWe have families come back for generations.â€ Karin Whitten of Rockland said she sent her two children to Hanover Nursery because she appreciated the schoolâ€™s welcoming environment. â€œI grew up in Hanover so I knew it was there from driving by. When I started to look at nursery schools, it had the best price and it was personalized â€“ not a chain,â€ she said. â€œWhen I went in, they made the registration process easy. I felt like my kids were really welcome, and as parents we were really welcome.â€ But besides the family-like environment, Fuller said his school is also known for its emphasis on learning. â€œPreschool education is very important,â€ Fuller said. â€œIf you start a child in an academic environment young, they will perform better socially and academically.â€ From science and math to phonics and reading, Fuller said he fuses traditional learning with elements of music and art to create an engaging and well-rounded learning environment for his students. â€œWe expose the students to all kids of things in order to build into the curriculum a well-rounded education,â€ Fuller said. â€œIt is all accentuated with fun, because learning should be fun,â€ he added. On Friday, students were decked out in their Patriots gear, ready to celebrate the recent Super Bowl win with a pizza party. Parties are a usual thing at Hanover Nursery, as teachers use holidays and events to teach students about different cultures and religions. â€œWe are a very fun school, but we also base our curriculum off of the elementary schools, so our students go to kindergarten fully prepared and even with a little edge,â€ Assistant Director Ashley Stevens said. As students built towers from blocks and painted Valentineâ€™s cards for their families on Friday, and all were eager to talk about their favorite times in school. â€œWe do a lot of stuff together. Itâ€™s a special place,â€ Nolan Frawley, 5, of Hanover said as he built a castle for one of his teachers. Maczpacay said her school has survived all these years because of its special mix of family, education and love. â€œOur longevity is based on our stability, but also because we are very affordable in a tight economy,â€ Maczpacay said. The school, which serves as both a preschool and day care center, offers a variety of programs at differing prices. But operating as both a preschool and day care facility can lead to long days for some of her students, making the family-oriented atmosphere all the more important, Maczpacay said. The center is open daily from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. â€œSome of these kids see more of us than their parents and thatâ€™s why we like to keep it a family-like atmosphere,â€ she said. Maczpacay has been at the helm of Hanover Nursery for 13 years and is the schoolâ€™s second owner. Although she purchased the school from its founder, Penny Reid in 2002, she first became acquainted with the preschool as an assistant teacher in 1985 while attending Bridgewater State University. For five years Maczpacay worked alongside Reid, learning the ins and outs of early childhood education. It was Hanover Nursery that would spark a passion for teaching and learning in Maczpacay and eventually, she would return to the school to continue the work of her mentor, Reid. â€œIt was like fate,â€ Maczpacay said. After earning her undergraduate degree in education and moving away to go to graduate school in Indiana, she lost touch with Reid. She returned to Brockton, her hometown, to teach first grade. About a decade after Maczpacay left Hanover Nursery to continue her own education, she happened to drive by the school and spotted Reid in the playground. She hopped out and reconnected with her old boss, letting her know that if ever Reid wanted to sell, she would be up for the challenge. Three days later Reid called to tell Maczpacay she was ready to pass the reigns. Ever since, Maczpacay said sheâ€™s been focused on bringing in the best team of teachers to bring the best â€“ and most fun â€“ education to her students. â€œWe are able to do it because we love what we do,â€ Maczpacay said. Hanover Nursery School & Day Care Center, located at 17 Silver St. inside Riley Hall, accepts students 2.9 years to 5 years old and is open year-round from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. Fulltime students cost $190 a week and a tiered payment schedule is available for half-time students.

With 15 years of experience in Early Childhood Education, I set out to open a center for children ages 6 months to 12 years old.  Each age grouping has their own room with highly qualified teachers and teacher assistants.
  Our philosophy is based on the belief that every child is unique and every child learns in a way unique to oneself. Our mission is to provide the best learning environment for the whole child from social and emotional, physical, cognitive,language to their parents, siblings, friends, health/nutrition and family.
  The programs promote a positive, supportive,nurturing environment with developmentally appropriate activities for every age. In addition to Summer Programs, we at the Canterbury Children’s Academy, Inc. offer childcare for children 1 to 12 years old M-F from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. During the school year we offer a Infant program for ages 6 weeks to 1 year, Toddler Program for ages 1-3 years, a Preschool program for children 3-5 years old and a Before and After-school program for children 5-12 years old.

We bring together a positive, happy setting with professional staff who facilitate and challenge our children to learn by doing. A child’s whole development – social, emotional and physical --- is nurtured as we move throughout our day.

Our age groups follow developmental milestones starting with our infant program. Our professionally-staffed infant care program provides the special care required for our youngest children beginning at six weeks. Families appreciate our dedicated and sensitive approach to the needs of their infants as they follow their natural routines of napping and mealtimes. A colorful and cheerful environment provides our infants the stimulation they need for this earliest growth.

Our age groups continue through to our Woddler, Toddler, Nursery School, PreK and “Graduates,” who are our before/after school and summer vacation friends. A variety of activities and themes engage and prepare our preschoolers and graduates as they continue to develop their skills and confidence. Enrichment activities and curriculum are designed for all age groups and include creative music and movement, a hands-on science program and computer skills.

The idea of creating a school came about at the request of several Park Church members who wanted their children enrolled int a nursery school and found limited facilities elsewhere in Norwich.  The school opened as a cooperative nursery school with parents and guardians volunteering in the classroom.  The school has grown over the years but the focus of the school has remained constant.  The dedicated and caring staff continues to provide children quality care and cultivate the kinds of experiences which are integral to the expected readiness and proper attitude needed to step into the world of formal schooling.  

The school, licensed by the state of Connecticut, is governed by its own Board of Directors comprised of both church members and non-church members.  Many board members are, and have been, teachers from various school districts which has helped the school stay current.  The school is non-denominational and welcomes children from Norwich and the surrounding communities.  The school's goal is to provide a safe and nurturing environment that enables each child to grow and flourish physically, socially, emotionally, and intelligently.

We encourage every single child to develop a strong sense of independence and learning desire. To achieve our objectives, Stoneview adopts the philosophy of Dr. Maria Montessori’s educational method. The key characteristic of the Montessori Method is for a child to learn independently and upgrade each child’s individual level of development.

The School’s curriculum is based on creating a prepared en vironment appropriate for children from three to ten years of age to engage in meaningful work. Our goal is to help each child learn to grow into a love for themselves and the world around them. It is designed to allow the child to satisfy each sensitive period when he or she is ready.

The classroom has Practical Life exercises for developing lifelong skills of organization, concentration, and care of their environment. These exercises encourage control of movement, eye hand coordination, and small motor control.There are Montessori Sensorial, Language, Math, Geography, and Science materials to creatively challenge the child. Various unit studies are taught during the course of the year. These may include dinosaurs, ocean life, outer space, and animals around the world, in depth cultural studies of different continents and countries, and many more depending on the interest of the children.

In our classrooms, every piece of equipment takes advantage of a child’s inherent desire to learn. Children may work in groups or on their own. They may sit at a table, or work at a rug on the floor. The classroom environment and teachers’ role are all carefully designed to enable each child’s self-paced growth.

Our low child to teacher ratios allow for better supervision and individualized instruction while our flexible scheduling can meet the needs of most families with young children. Our integrated curriculum and literacy-rich environment can provide your children with an abundance of experiences which intentionally promote their developmental skills and knowledge across all domains. Our extensive outdoor playground with gardens offers opportunities for growth and learning out-of-doors while developing an awareness of the natural world. At 1st Church Preschool, we believe a child acquires knowledge about the physical and social worlds in which he or she lives through playful interaction with objects and people — “Learning by Experiencing.”

1st Church Preschool is housed in the First Congregational Church on the Cheshire Green. We are an independent, not-for-profit, child-centered program–not an extension of the Church nor affiliated with its religious program.

In 1920 the old academy building, mysteriously caught fire and was burned to uselessness.

In the aftermath, Arthur T. Nettleton, president of Newtown Savings Bank and financial advisor to Mary E. Hawley, convinced her to donate a new High School building to the town.  This became the first of several benefactions to the town from that exceedingly generous woman.

The school, which was to be named for her parents, was completed in 1921 and was considered to be one of the most advanced school buildings in the state at that time.  In addition to having central heating, it was completely fireproof and contained a state of the art chemistry lab and full auditorium for community meetings.

The building continued to be used as a High School until 1953 when a new High School was constructed on Queen Street.  The Hawley School subsequently became a K-8th grade elementary school and after the conversion of the Queen Street building into a Middle School in 1974, it became a K-5th grade elementary school.

The building is situated on a level 1.2 acre plot that adjoins Taylor Field which it uses for playground facilities.   Taylor Field was the former Newtown Fairgrounds and it was donated to the town by Cornelius B. Taylor in the 1920's.  The remains of the old fair race track can still be seen in the woods to the north of this field.

It is a long standing tradition that Mary E. Hawley's generosity is commemorated each year around Memorial Day when  4th graders are selected at random and being joined by the Hawley School principal, they place potted flowers on Miss Hawley's grave in the village cemetery.  After this brief ceremony, they visit the Town Hall and the Soldier's and Sailor's Monument, two of Miss Hawley's other gifts to the town.";"http://newtown.hawley.schooldesk.net/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

O.C.N.S. is located in the High Plains Community Center.  

The preschool years are much more than the time before “real school.”  They are an unparalleled time of growth, joy, and wonder.  What a wonderful time for parents to be involved in their child’s life!  In return for an investment of time and energy, parents who co-op have opportunities to grow in knowledge and understanding of the world of young children, while enjoying a shared experience with like-minded parents.  We believe that children learn best when they have: 
 
* A child-centered environment where they can work and play at their own level and develop at their own pace.
* A supportive, nurturing atmosphere to stimulate and reinforce positive self-awareness, confidence and self-esteem.
* A rich learning environment and an array of experiences that foster observation, language development, problem solving, and satisfaction of personal achievement.
* The opportunity to participate in group experiences that encourage development of communication and listening skills and respect for others.
* A myriad of opportunities for free self-expression in art, music, movement, story telling, dramatic and creative play.
* The opportunity to relate to and feel secure with adults other than their own parents.
* Help in recognizing reasonable limits, strengthening emotional control and developing self discipline.
* Equipment and space to development strength and coordination.

The mainstays of our learning environment include block play, art, dramatic play, music, books, table toys, puzzles, and sand and water play.

Opened in October 1955 by the mother’s club of Plantsville Congregational Church, the nursery school began with Mrs. Ruth Nelson, Mrs. Helen Macleod and Mrs. Otley Kania teaching 16 children in the 4 year old class and 17 children in the 3 year old class. Each year the teaching staff has provided children in Southington and surrounding towns with an educational experience that will prepare them for entering kindergarten.

Over the years the program has improved to provide the best up to date experience for each child in socialization, self-reliance, cognitive skills, fine and gross motor skills and improving imagination while still caring for the basic needs of 3-5 year olds.

Seven values that underlie SPFS’s programs are:
    Relationship-based programming. SPFS’s staff take the time to develop trusting, nurturing and respectful relationships with children and youth.
    Continuity of care. The programs are designed to ensure continuity of care for both the children of teenage parents and the teenage parents. SPFS has extremely low staff turnover, which is unusual in the child care field.
    Cultural competence. All of SPFS’s staff are culturally competent. Staff receive annual training to enhance their cultural competencies.
    Comprehensive services. A young family’s every identified need is either addressed within SPFS or by connecting the young family to other community services.
    High expectations. SPFS expects that teen parents will finish high school, achieve academically and become self-supporting in the future. SPFS programs help teen parents develop hopeful and positive visions for their futures.
    High quality early childhood experience. SPFS’s early childhood program is not just a babysitting service.  It provides quality early childhood education and is accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).
    School-based services. SPFS’s services are provided on-site in the school setting.

Our curriculum consists of monthly themes that allow children to develop an awareness of the world around them, as well as the skills necessary to transition from infants to toddlers to preschoolers to school-aged children. It is the primary goal of the staff at Sunshine Preschool to create a safe environment where children will find warmth, comfort, gentleness and an abundance of opportunities for movement, exploration and self-discovery. We will help each child achieve his/her fullest potential by recognizing each stage of development and creating an environment designed to nurture and support growth during each stage.  We will help promote each child’s independence, self-discipline, social competence, self-awareness, enthusiasm for learning and problem-solving skills.  We will assist parents during the various developmental stages of their child, while guiding them to better enrich their child’s growth and development.

My name is Lorraine and I am the Owner/Operator of this wonderful school.  I would like to take this opportunity to tell you why our school might very likely be a great fit for you and your family.

Creative Development first opened its doors in June of 1991 as a home daycare center and quickly expanded into our present facility in August of 1996.   It was developed out of my own love for children and the need to provide quality child care to our community.  In addition to a degree in Early Childhood Education and over 25 years of experience as an administrator and teacher, I bring to you through our facility a group of highly trained outstanding teachers whose love for children and a desire to see them flourish in all aspects of development shines through all they do.

 Our goal is to facilitate these very young children to grow into joy filled lifetime learners.  Our focus is on the individual child with an emphasis on health and safety and interaction.  Interaction between the teachers and children as well as teachers and parents.  Positive relationships with families based on mutual trust and respect is a key component to accomplishing our goals.  We are passionate about providing your children with the tools they need to be successful, well rounded learners in all aspects of life.

For starters, we know that the quality of the relationships that we form and the service that we provide will ultimately transform the lives of those we touch. That is why we take care to treat each family member as our own.
We understand what families are looking for when one or both parents work. We operate our centers as if our own children were enrolled…and many of them are! In short, everything we do revolves around family – yours and ours. That’s why we’ve invested in state-of-the-art security systems. One way we give you greater peace of mind is by providing access for you to see your child online, anytime, from anywhere in the world. For many of our parents, our Parent Internet Monitoring system is their favorite Lightbridge difference.
As you learn more about our curriculum, you’ll learn how we create “The Lightbridge Advantage.” Our comprehensive early education programs focus entirely on the needs of the individual child; learning your child’s strengths, we build on them with stimulating, hands-on learning activities and lots of positive reinforcement. Infant through Kindergarten age children experience a nurturing “home-away-from-home” atmosphere utilizing Seedlings Early Childhood Education Programs®; a New Jersey state-approved early learning program. In your tuition are enrichment programs, including American Sign Language, Spanish, Reading Readiness and Musical Beginnings®. All of this, coupled with positive attitudes and one-on-one interactions with teachers, encourage children to reach their full cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and creative potential.
Our facilities are state-of-the-art, clean and “green”. Classrooms are big and bright, and designed to be developmentally appropriate for the age group that uses it; most with child-sized potties and sinks to ensure that teachers remain in the classroom and in ratio at all times. Days are filled with a healthy dose of exercise on large outdoor playgrounds. Some centers feature super safe indoor gyms with all kinds of equipment to climb through and jump on.
Our educators are not only warm and nurturing, they’re all CPR and First Aid certified. What’s more, we exceed the state requirements for teacher certification and every center operates at or better than the NJ state child/teacher ratio requirements. And we do our absolute best to ensure our employees stay with us. Our extensive employee benefits package is highly unusual in the child care industry and includes a 401K, health benefits, employee discounts for child care and incentive bonus plans for attendance, longevity and performance. These benefits all help to ensure your child receives the advantage of continuity of care.

The learning environment at the Holly Pond School is experiential, interactive, and collaborative, with an emphasis on educating the whole person— fostering the intellectual, socio-emotional, and physical growth of each child. We plan and follow a consistent schedule daily with learning goals in mind.  This helps children feel secure (because they know what comes next) and independent (because they move from one activity to another easily and confidently).

Our curriculum is organized thematically, enabling children to make thoughtful connections and comparisons from their own observations, explorations, and experiences. We believe we teach children best when we support and extend their learning through play, challenging them to discover their own abilities and to try the unfamiliar.

Each area of the classroom has a developmental purpose.  This allows children to learn through discovery in a hands-on, active environment. We believe when children actively explore the learning environment, they construct their own meaning, which makes them feel confident and independent because they are truly invested in the experience.
 
We utilize proactive classroom management techniques and respectful language. This models respect for self and others, and guides children to focus on good choices. We believe that children who feel respected and confident that they are an integral part of the life of the classroom are consequently sensitive and responsive to others. From classroom rules to school-wide projects, we teach that all people are deserving of respect and kindness.
 
Our affiliation with the YMCA allows opportunities for active enrichment, including swimming and gymnastics.  This broadens learning beyond the classroom, engaging the body as well as the mind, helping children develop courage and confidence. We believe that courage, confidence and teamwork can be taught effectively through our program that links “ABCs” with “In the water, please.”  We believe that our students leave the Holly Pond School with an awareness of community, and apply the core values we espouse: respect, responsibility, honesty, and caring";"http://www.darien-ymca.org/the-holly-pond-school";"https://www.facebook.com/thedarienymca";;;"http://www.darien-ymca.org/special-needs/enrichment-clubs/61-y-news/153-earlier-hours";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We are a private, non-profit, non-denominational nursery school that does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, or color. We have grown and changed in many ways since our inception, but our mission remains the same: “To provide, as a community service, a non-profit, non-sectarian nursery school of the highest educational standards.”
 
Our staff consists of qualified and experienced teachers who clearly understand the social and emotional needs of pre-school children. In order to meet and maintain the “highest of educational standards,"" teachers at First Presbyterian attend classes, workshops and in-service days, as required by Connecticut state law. This policy assures that our staff is aware of best practice in education while always caring for and meeting the needs of the individual child. The unique personality, learning style, and family background of each child are the concern of each teacher and staff member here.

Research demonstrates that children who are part of a looped  classroom experience less stress, more instructional time and an increased sense of stability. The concept of a multi-age classroom in followed in Montessori as well as Waldorf (Steiner) Schools. A multi-age environment looks towards meeting the developmental needs of young children rather than just moving them through an educational system based on date of birth.

It is a non-denominational non-profit weekday program operated by the Rowayton United Methodist Church.  
 
Five Mile River Nursery School focuses on the development of the whole child: intellectual, social, emotional, spiritual, and physical.  Our goal is to create a framework of materials and an atmosphere of love and acceptance in a partnership between families and staff that will set the stage for discovery and growth.  We believe that when we allow a child to make appropriate choices, we are building a firm foundation for later learning and preparing the child for the ever-changing world.

We follow an evolving mix of Bank Street Method, Creative Curriculum and the Emergent Curriculum.  By looking at the children individually, we hope to encourage autonomy and support them in all of their areas of development thereby achieving a positive self-image for each child.

 We implement the State of Connecticut Preschool Curriculum Framework by following an intentional process of planning for the observation of children’s development as it naturally occurs in the learning experiences of the classroom.  We reflect our observations, and then plan strategies for supporting children in subsequent themes, as children master the benchmarks of development and emerge into successful levels of growth. Our goal is for children to develop a frame of reference of ideas, knowledge, problem-solving, motor and social skills that will prepare them for a lifetime of learning.   

To see how we achieve this goal, come and visit us.   We look forward to seeing you!

In a warm, caring, risk-free and nurturing environment, they can be encouraged to develop a positive image of themselves and respect for others.

We believe that parents are the primary teachers of their pre-school children and entrust them to our loving care. Accordingly, the family is an integral part of our pre-school community, where interaction between parents, teachers and administrators is considered an essential element.

It has been serving families from South Salem, Redding and Ridgefield for over 46 years. Founded by Ethelyn Pinchbeck in 1967, it is a nursery school commited to help our children seek a foundation for a happy and successful life.

Our goal at CCK is to build a child’s self confidence and increase his or her awareness of the world. It is our belief that with self confidence and awarness a child is better equiped to accept the challenges which he or she will meet on a daily basis, thus promoting a healthy attitude toward new experiences and fostering a life-long love of learning.

At CCK we believe a “hands-on” approach of learning best achieves these goals. We have developed a curriculum of well planned activities that meets the child at his or her level of interest and ability. Our caring and attentive teachers provide opportunities for each child to discover at his or her own pace. We encourage our children to be inquisitive and to want to learn the “why” and “how” as well as the ""what"".

CCK has moved to a new location at 103 Main Street in Ridgefield and occupies the classrooms of the First Congregational Church.";"http://cckpreschool.com/contactus.html";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://cckpreschool.com/images/programsside.jpg";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As interest grew, the class moved from her living room to Ridgefield Parks and Recreation, then to a storefront and in 2000 to its award-winning building at 165 Danbury Road. At its expanded space the Enchanted Garden grew to include comprehensive dance and theater programs; preschool, pre-K, and Twos programs; yoga classes and birthday parties on weekends. Four years later, Judy's sons Noah and Isaac completed their graduate studies in music and joined the staff. The Enchanted Garden expanded again in 2004 with the addition of a second facility – a spacious state-of-the-art studio on a two-acre site at 529 Ethan Allen Hwy. The school could now offer private music and voice lessons, additional dance and drama programs, a recording studio, performance space, gymnastics program, and ongoing art exhibits.

Today Suncatchers has 250 children enrolled who attend from Melissa Jones, Baldwin and Adams Middle Schools. The program has always been a safe, nurturing environment, where children can try out new activities and crafts with other children in a friendly, no-pressure atmosphere.

We are centrally located in Stamford, convenient to mass transit system along a main bus route, within walking distance to downtown, and easy access to major highways.

We have pride ourselves in providing the best nursery care for infants and toddlers, and are known for providing a top level educational service for preschoolers.  We are open year round and our hours are from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  We provide both full time and part time care.  Parents get to design their schedules to fit their need.

We have been in business for over a quarter of a century.  Preschool children who have spent at least two years in our program prior to attending regular school leave well prepared for primary school, and most are reading at various levels, i.e. recognizing words, spot reading, and fluent readers.

Before it became a State mandate or fashionable, our goals were to prepare our children for school in a worry-free environment.  We are caring for all the children needs while parents are working

Children strive and progress better when they are kept in smaller groups.  Our infants and toddlers (all under three) are grouped in three classes of eight.  In each group of eight, there are two teachers according to the State mandate ratio of teacher to every four infants/toddlers.  Our preschoolers are grouped according to State guidelines of one teacher perten children.

Our goal is to provide a loving, caring, enjoyable and stimulant structured environment as they are enhancing their educational skills.

Our curriculum emphasizes social skills, creativity and positive self-esteem through a variety of loosely structured play and teacher-directed activities such as Circle Time, Music & Movement and Science & Nature.   Our teachers have a clear understanding of childhood development and can guide children and counsel parents accordingly.

We are small by design, allowing us to maintain a child-to-teacher ratio of never more than 8 to 1.  This means children receive lots of individual attention and everyone can get to know each other well.  The center has one large main room which we have broken up into smaller cozy spaces to create a variety of play areas, a play kitchen, a block corner, art table, reading area, water or bead table and a table for using small manipulatives.

We have a variety of small classroom pets throughout the year such as: goldfish, butterflies, a rabbit and visiting frogs and salamanders.  The center also has a full kitchen that teachers and parents use for preparing snacks, special baking projects or making such things as play dough.  Cooking with the children is an important part of our curriculum.

This arrangement creates a safe, relaxed and enriching environment that is ""Family Friendly."" In practical terms, this means many small things. We are flexible.  For instance, we do not require children to be toilet trained before entering preschool.  Experience shows that children achieve developmental milestones with gentle encouragement in a relaxed and supportive environment focusing on success rather than failure.

Moving outside, PVCC has a fenced-in playground with a large sandbox area, climbing equipment and ample room to run around and play with outdoor toys.

Daily activities are often connected to the community and the simple activities of daily life such as, visiting the post office, fire department, local hospital or town hall.  We take several field trips beyond the local area during the school year to an apple orchard, pumpkin patch or other places of interest.  Parents will be asked to volunteer to drive for some of these trips.  Parents who have a special field of interest or whose workplace would make a good field trip destination are invited to suggest these to the teacher.

The seasons and the changes they bring are also reflected in our activities,  such as, using colored fall leaves or flowers in the spring for crafts. These activities  help small children understand the changes going on around them and the ways in which things fits together.  Children may use their ""Free-Play"" time for this kind of special activity that teachers have arranged for the day or may simply play with the other children and toys of their choice.

The owner, Geraldine Dolinar grew the business out of her own basement in Kansas City, Kansas. In the 1950s the words Childcare Center, Preschool, or even Daycare had yet to be spoken. The care of young children at that time usually fell to the local church or the domestic care giver. Few people thought about children’s education at such a young age in addition to their care, but Geraldine recognized this situation. She was not satisfied with the level of attention that the local children were receiving when it came to their education. At the time she had her third child (Her youngest daughter who is our current Regional Director), she saw an opportunity to the solve a problem in the local community, while also being able to care for her daughter.

During the late 1950’s another opportunity arose that helped this new venture gain traction: Women were entering the workforce and finding it hard to find care.  She networked with the women to in the community to find a sizable demand for women needing this service. She told the families of the community if she did decide to open a care center, that she would start an educational center, “a preschool… she would not be a babysitter”.  (Geraldine will correct anyone who calls Kiddi Kollege a Day Care to this day)

So, Geraldine decided to do it herself and develop an educational program. Ultimately, she became a entrepreneur while also giving her the option to care and educate her daughter. With her success she opened her first brick and mortar center in the mid 1960’s. She has always said that opening this business was one of her proudest accomplishments, and she was especially proud of opening up the business at a time when opportunities for women where scarce compared to today.

After opening her first center she started many traditions that set a standard among early education centers. To name a few, she had learning centers that included math, science, art, music, and manipulative play. Another tradition started at Kiddi Kollege is the preschool graduation. We conduct our preschool graduation every May. It is a great treat for the parents and every graduation is treasured by our parents and staff.

After the first center opened she continued to reinvest into her business later opening two more locations in Kansas City Kansas in the 1970’s. In the 1980’s she opened up two more locations in Olathe Kansas. The 6th & 7th Kiddi Kolleges where opened in Overland Park and Leawood. Now, the third Generation (Geraldine’s grandchildren) currently work in the centers and are looking ahead to the future, continuing to offer this valuable service to the community.";"http://www.kiddikollegechildcare.com/kk-contact-us.php";;;"http://www.kiddikollegechildcare.com/kk-employment.php";"http://www.kiddikollegechildcare.com/useruploads/files/kkinc._enrollment_form_update.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When the weather is nice, you will find the children gardening or exploring nature outdoors. (Many times the deer graze in the pasture outside our back window.) 

Indoors, the classroom is run much like the early one-room school house, with blended ages together in the same room to enhance the joy of learning. Children are allowed to freely choose from a number of developmentally appropriate activities – learning at their own, individual pace and according to their ability. Our Montessori approach emphasizes learning through all five senses, not just through listening, watching, or reading. Therefore, learning is an exciting process of discovery, leading to concentration, motivation, self-discipline, and a love of learning.
Our reading program is hands-on.  Other subjects studied are geography (i.e., the continents), language, history, math and science.

To accommodate your child’s cultural needs, we offer private piano lessons, spanish, creative movement. We also have cultural arts day which is Friday with music and art.

Christots accepts children from 18 months  through age 6.  There are three distinct programs by age group: toddlers (18 months to age 3) and primary / kindergarten.  Toddlers are taught at our Woodland facility, and primary / kindergarten students learn at our Midland location. 

All of our teachers are certified Montessori teachers. Their emphasis is on fostering the best in each child and teaching each child according
to their individual interests and strengths.

The vision was for a beautiful place where children could go about their task of self-construction, a place lovingly and intentionally prepared for children. The vision included finding and preparing adults for this most noble work, who were willing to humble themselves and, as Dr. Montessori had admonished, “have the faith to follow the child.” Their qualities of being life-long learners, having an enduring sense of humor, holding a profound respect for children as well as their ability to function without enough sleep (at least in those early years) have helped to see the vision to fruition.

Raintree is a beautifully prepared environment physically, both indoors and out and is staffed with carefully and lovingly prepared adults who uphold the ideals of the Montessori philosophy. It is the love shared among the children and adults as well as the love that we all feel toward our prepared environment that is the foundation of the spirit of Raintree, inevitably felt by anyone who spends any time in the community that is our school. We have from the beginning been dedicated to providing working families with not only the finest in early childhood and elementary education, but with the security that they were able to go to work full in the knowledge that their children were getting the very best and most loving care available outside their immediate family.";"http://raintreemontessori.org/current/";"https://www.facebook.com/raintreemontessorischool";;;"http://raintreemontessori.org/current/admissions/";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://raintreemontessori.org/current/rtr-current/uploads/2015/01/rLogoReg.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All of Bethany's teachers are state certified. School data and several reports are submitted to the Kansas State Department of Education each year.

 

Evaluation is an integral part of the education process. It helps students, parents, teachers, and administrators to assess the academic experience with which they are working. This also enables parents to monitor the academic progress of thier child(ren).

 

Teachers and administrators use evaluations to determine the effectiveness of the instructional program. At Bethany, both formative evaluations (such as quizzes, teacher-created tests) and summative evaluations (such as unit or post-tests) Are utilized to determine mastery of a concept.

As part of our accreditation, the Kansas State Assessments are given to the students in reading, writing, social studies, scienc,e and mathematics.

 

Students also take the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS), which is usually administered in late winter or early spring.

 

Methods of evaluation and assessments will be discussed at the first parent-teacher conference.

 

Bethany Lutheran School does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national, and ethnic origin in administration of it's admission policies, educational policies, or other school-administered programs and activities.

Miss Valerie is the lead teacher/director. She has taught preschool for twenty one years. She loves spending time teaching and guiding little people. Miss Sharon has taught at Stony Point for three years. She is a wonderful, caring teacher to the children.
Our Pre-K curriculum covers a weekly theme, letter, numbers, patterns, shapes, colors, rhyming, opposite and position words. We enjoy exploring the world through simple science activities and experiments. Our ""Children Around The World"" curriculum helps us celebrate and appreciate how 4 & 5 year olds live and play in other parts of the world.
Our 3 year old curriculum covers basic introductions to letters, numbers, shapes and colors along with a daily theme. Much emphasis is given to developing social skills with this age group.
Each day includes Bible Time. We hear Bible Stories, learn scripture verses and sing songs that help little ones celebrate God and Jesus.

The initial summer program, called Lift Them Up, was purposed to provide academic enrichment and fun activities to the program participants.

In 2008, Oak Ridge joined the Kansas City Freedom School Initiative of Kansas City, Missouri.  Freedom Schools were founded by Marian Edelman Wright of the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF) of Washington, DC.  Oak Ridge Freedom School became a national Freedom School model in 2009 because of its effective program implementation, leadership, administration, intergenerational leadership development of its Servant Leaders and its health and nutrition component.

In the summer of 2013, Oak Ridge made the decision to be an independent Freedom School site so they could work directly with the CDF.  Since Oak Ridge has been providing a summer enrichment program for seven consecutive years, it has broadened its program offerings to include Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and an integrated health component.

Because the Oak Ridge Youth Development Corporation wanted to continue to expand on its program offerings, they decided to no longer be apart of the CDF model and they established their own entity named the Oak Ridge Youth Development School as a 501c3 in 2013.";"http://ormbc.org/oryd-school/";;;;"http://ormbc.org/oryd-school/";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://ormbc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/oak_ridge_large-2.gif";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our program is based upon the Montessori principles of self-direction, and experiential education. We promote a thoughtful and sensitive demeanor in the classrooms, and we support cooperation between children as they learn from one another.

Our facilities are designed to stimulate a child’s imagination, curiosity and interest. Our curriculum is diverse and extensive to accommodate all styles of learning, while also being continuously evaluated to ensure that it is effective and adaptive in our changing world. Our highly specialized individual assessment program allows us to track each child’s personal progress, directly measure academic advancement and supplement our program for each child’s particular needs.

No infant, preschool or grade school program is more committed to the academic and personal success of its students. Our students love school, embrace challenges, and succeed in life.

Carmel Regional Medical Center, Pittsburg State University and USD 250. These organizations have — since their beginnings — been committed to significantly improving the quality of life of this community.

It was their vision that a center be opened that would provide high quality, affordable child care and preschool services, as well as centralize those services and agencies that are concerned with the needs of children and their families. Organizations can better address the needs of the 21st Century family and shape a brighter, healthier future for our children. 

As a not-for-profit organization, The Center is dedicated to meeting the needs of all children regardless of age, sex, race, color,creed, national origin, handicap or economic status. Its staff has been selected for both their professional skills, as well as their sensitivity to the challenges families’ face. Its mission is to create and maintain a safe and caring atmosphere that promotes physical, social, emotional and cognitive growth.

The Center houses a multiplicity of much needed family-related services. Locating all needed services in one facility strengthens the support that many families need to provide an environment that helps develop a healthy child ready to learn. The following services are housed in one readily accessible facility located at 1600 N. Walnut, Pittsburg, Kansas.

   • Quality, affordable child care, children birth to 12 years
   • Developmentally appropriate preschool, children 3 to 5  
   • Summer programs for youth
   • Comprehensive services for special needs children
    • Social and mental health services
   • Comprehensive adult education services
   • Parent education
   • Coordination of existing services

These services are offered through collaboration of existing providers, including Parents as Teachers, SEK Interlocal 637 Early Childhood Special Education Services, SEK Education Service Center-Birth to Three Special Education Services, USD 250 Adult Education Center, Infant Toddler Mental Health, Via Christi Outreach, and Early Childhood Block Grant 

The Center merges early childhood efforts and family focused efforts to ensure that agencies in the community are effectively and efficiently offering services that are developmentally appropriate, accessible to all children and families. These services will help parents succeed in their role as their child’s first and most important teacher.";"https://sites.google.com/site/familyresourcecenter/home";;;;"https://sites.google.com/site/familyresourcecenter/registration";"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7vjyx9hlbIXb3lCVTlIUnpjZHc/edit?pli=1";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"https://sites.google.com/site/familyresourcecenter/_/rsrc/1429565190281/home/center%20header.jpg";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Learning through play helps children relate positively to themselves, to others, and to the world around them.  We share and model basic Christian concepts, most specifically in the areas of exploring the wonders of Creation and in caring for ourselves, for others, and for our environment as our loving God cares for us.

The most important goal of our curriculum is to help children become enthusiastic learners.  This means that they will become active and creative explorers who are not afraid to try out their own ideas and to think their own thoughts.  Our intent is for our preschoolers to become independent, self-confident, inquisitive, self-motivated learners.  We’re teaching them how to learn, not just in preschool, but all throughout their lives.  We’re allowing them to learn at their own pace and in ways that are most appropriate for them.  We’re helping them develop good habits and attitudes which will make a difference throughout their lives.";"http://www.fccemporia.org/lcp1.htm";;;;"http://www.fccemporia.org/LCP_App_Form.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.fccemporia.org/images/banner_main.jpg";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jesus Time:
A Voyages curriculum is used to teach the children that Jesus loves them and is their Friend. He is real, always near, and has power to help little children, mommies, daddies, teachers, and grandparents. Most importantly, we teach that Jesus is our Savior who takes away our sins. The curriculum is set up in 36 weekly units, in which Bible stories are taught in chronological order. The Bible is taught as one big story, which tells about God’s love for us as shown in His plan for our salvation. Jelly, a friendly puppet, helps to show how the Bible message applies to children’s lives today. Twice a month, we join the school kids in Chapel.

Literacy:
There is no set curriculum that is used during literacy circle and centers. They center on a yearly theme, which is divided into weekly units. One letter is taught each week, (in no particular order) while focusing on this letter, children are taught to recognize the capital letter. For those that will be entering Kindergarten the following year, the lowercase letter is introduced, as well as the sound it makes. Some activities that may occur include a letter hunt, brainstorming words that have that beginning sound, and some letter art.

Math & Science:
There is no set curriculum used during math circle and centers. Throughout the year, children become familiar with counting to 25 and beyond, recognizing numbers, and understanding how many that is. Children also learn to recognize the basic colors and shapes. Some terms that are introduced to the children include sorting, measuring, ordering, position words, estimating, and more.

Handwriting:
A Pre-K Get Set for School (part of Handwriting Without Tears) curriculum is used to develop a strong foundation in letter formation that is developmentally appropriate. It is designed to be a year of preparation in a playful way that is child-friendly. It follows a developmental sequence when introducing how to correctly write letters. Every capital letter can be properly formed using only 4 strokes, a big line, little line, big curve, and little curve. We start with those that use lines only, proceed on to letters that contain curves, and end up with those letters that require a diagonal stroke.

Art:

Another portion of the day is art time, both free and directed. Some days we have an end goal in mind for art time. Other times, children are able to choose what they would like to create and focus in on the process. We use a variety of materials, such as playdoh, stencils, watercolor, paints, yarn, feathers, and more.
Music and movement is part of each day as well. Children are given the opportunity to utilize instruments while singing and dancing.
Outdoor play allows the children a chance to use age appropriate playground equipment in a fenced-in area.

Free Time:

One important part of the day is Free Choice time. Children within this age range learn through play. They are given time to choose which area of the room to play in, reading corner, house and dress-up, blocks, or others. We offer several manipulatives that encourage natural development, such as lacing, puzzles, interlocking cubes, pattern pieces, and much more.";"http://www.stpaulscheney.org/";;;;"http://www.stpaulscheney.org/tuition---admission.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://nebula.wsimg.com/afc475027bf0c5d0009383fd1f28dcb6?AccessKeyId=81329F0AE4A8EB72DEAB&disposition=0&alloworigin=1";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One benefit of having care at Asbury Station is the opportunity for the children to interact with the residents of Asbury Park. Every class participates daily in several different types of intergenerational activities such as cooking, share time, craft projects, story times and music and movement. All activities are supervised by both the teachers and nurses/ activities aides. Both Asbury Park and Asbury Station feel that it is very important to bridge the gap between the generations by fostering the relationships between the youth and the elderly.

1051685;"Seltzer School Age Program";"11660 E Lincoln";"Wichita";"KS";67207;"SEDGWICK";"316- 973-4001";"http://www.seltzer.usd259.org/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=157648";;"The story of Seltzer School really begins with the fresh surge of western migration which swept the United States after the close of the Civil War.

After the most pressing needs of the early settlements had been met, a school was erected on the E. O. Smith farm which occupied the half section on the north side of the road between 127th and 143rd Streets East. The school itself, called the Brown School, stood about one-half mile east of 127th Street on the north side of Kellogg, also known as East U.S. Highway 54. Nothing remains at this site today, and there is little information concerning the structure. It is known that the men in the community built the school which served about 50 pupils who resided in the district which was bounded by Greenwich Road on the west from one-half mile south of Pawnee to one-half mile north of Kellogg and on the east by the Butler County line. This was an area of nine square miles. In 1876 the three half sections lying south of Pawnee were excluded, leaving the district wholly within Minneha Township.

No one seems to know why the school was called the Brown School; no one can recall a family by that name in the neighborhood. It is certain that it was designated as Common School District 31 of Sedgwick County, Kansas, and established in 1874.

The school was also used by the community as a place for public worship on Sunday. Its location in the very northern part of the district made it quite a distance for some of the patrons who used the community center, and in 1880 the school was relocated on the Thomas Means farm one-half mile north of Harry Street on 143rd Street East. This school was also called the Brown School.

In 1889 a new school was built to accommodate the increased enrollment. At this time the school was named Seltzer after the springs for which the community became known. Thad Smith was the carpenter, and materials and labor are supposed to have cost $100. In 1923 Seltzer School was more centrally located in the district, the relocation being established at 903 South 127th Street East.

On February 30, 1951 a contract was executed between the C. E. Vollmer Con­struction Company and Sedgwick County School District 31 in the sum of $29,415 for the construction of a new brick school to be located at 903 South 127th Street East. Brown Electrical Company had the wiring contract for $1,125, and Kendall Plumbing and Heating was to install the pump and septic tank system for $6,335. In October a housewarming welcomed patrons to the new structure which consisted of two classrooms, rest rooms, and a multipurpose room. This would be the northernmost area in the building. Enrollment was between 70 and 80 students.

In 1954 Seltzer School began another transition period. Many new housing developments had been created in the community, and there was a rapid gain of newcomers to the district. In 1956 three classrooms, a principal’s office, and teachers’ lounge were added to the structure. This was the central section of the building. Seltzer now had five teachers, a budget of $39,110, and a public transportation system. By 1959 Seltzer had become crowded to the point there was some discussion of possible consolidation with Andover. It was thought that Andover might take the seventh and eighth grades, making further construction of facilities unnecessary; however, no action was taken. In 1960 Seltzer gained the former students of Franklin District 72, making a total enrollment of 185. On May 26, 1960 a bond election was held at the school and carried, 57-5, to provide funds for adding the south classrooms, the kitchen, and the gymnasium plus additional rest rooms. A contract for $109,035 was executed with Hibbs and Pettit, architects, and Caro Construction Company to accomplish this work. With the completion of the addition, a full-time lunch program became a part of the school program.

For the next few years, Seltzer School District continued to gain steadily in enrollment, and the activities and services offered were expanded. A school secretary was employed to relieve the principal of routine clerical duties. A nurse and counselor began to visit Seltzer a few hours each week, and instructors for art and music were added to the faculty. In 1964 the library annex to the pre building was constructed. Feldner and Frey were the architects, and the W. B. Carter Construction Company was awarded the contract for $24,889. The school now had a total of ten classrooms, a fine library space, and a nice gymnasium for its comprehensive educational program. Seltzer enrolled its first kindergarten students during the 1964-65 school term.

In 1964 the Kansas Legislature passed the School Unification Act which provided for consolidation of many small school districts in the state. As a result, Seltzer Common School District 31 became a part of Unified School District 259, Wichita Public Schools, which had a K-6-3-3 organizational pattern for school attendance centers. Though Seltzer lost its seventh and eighth grade students through unification, it also gained additional students in the lower grades when its neighbor to the west, Mammoth Cave District 22, was closed. Seltzer became one of the largest in area designated attendance centers in the city school system.

The building began as Meridian Elementary School, built in 1924. Meridian Elementary School merged with the younger Lawrence Elementary School after a building project in 1976. In January 1979, Meridian was given a new mission as an alternative high school on the west side of Wichita. During the first semester, 75 students were enrolled and the school shared a staff with the existing Metro-Boulevard Alternative High School. In August 1979, Metro-Meridian opened with a staff of six full time teachers and one half time teacher and support staff. 
 
Over the years, Metro-Meridian enrollment has increased with the academic needs of high school students has an average enrollment of 160. As a result of the steadily increased enrollment, the building opened a multi-purpose room, kitchen, and science room as a part of the $284.5 million bond program in 2003. The original building has 11 classrooms, a general office, and three smaller offices and staff work room. Two former classrooms serve as a Child Development Center and operate in a partnership with the YMCA of Wichita. Metro-Meridian now has a staff of 15 full time teachers, two shared teachers with Boulevard, four support staff members, and a principal.

Designed by the architectural firm of Wendell Parks and Sons, the building was modern in style and was faced with salmon colored bricks accented by exposed concrete structural elements. Built originally on a single level, its 66 classrooms and its auditorium, cafeteria, library and two gymnasiums ranged over a considerable portion of its 60 acres of campus.

A major addition to the building in 1968-69 raised the number of classrooms to 98, and the low line of the building was changed slightly by the addition of a high ceiling library and mezzanine area totaling over 12,000 square feet of floor space and a second-story addition of five classrooms in the inner court area. Also included in the new additions were specialized educable mentally handicapped and reading laboratory facilities as well as classrooms, language laboratories and team teaching rooms. The expansion provided for a student body of 2,480 pupils and required the faculty be expanded to 108.

In the fall of 1988, all ninth graders were moved to high schools, making them four-year institutions.

In 1992, a classroom was converted into a black box theatre for the drama department.

In 2004, a new wing was constructed at the south end of the building. The classrooms were constructed specifically for science and foreign language classes.

Three years later another site was purchased in northeast Wichita for the same purpose. August 4, 1980 the architectural firm of Griffith and Bonham was appointed to design two elementary school buildings, identical in plan but not in finish, to be located on these two sites.

E.W.  Johnson, Inc. was awarded the building contract for both locations in the amount of approximately $3,250,000 per building. Construction began in September 1982 and the doors opened for 506 students at the northeast site in August 1984 and named Delore O. Gammon Elementary School.

Miss Gammon became assistant superintendent in charge of elementary education in 1953, and in 1958 Miss Gammon became director of elementary curriculum. She retired in 1966. She had attained the highest position any woman ever had in the Wichita Public Schools system at that time. She died September 30, 1981.

Already overcrowded, the Gammon pre-kindergarten program was moved to Minneha Elementary School in 1985-86. That year enrollment reached 563. Kindergartners from Gammon were moved to Minneha for one year only in 1987-88. The staff was involved in a Mastery Learning pilot project for five years. The project concluded in the spring of 1987.

Beginning the 1988-89 school year, fifth and sixth graders were sent to the re-opened Kistler School which was referred to as the Gammon Annex. Both fifth and sixth graders from the Annex left for the newly created Coleman Middle School in 1989. From 1989-1993, third graders were sent to the Annex. After four years at the Annex, third graders eagerly anticipated being on the same campus with other grades. After much thought and planning, it was decided kindergartners should be the class of choice for the Annex. Parents were happy with this choice because they did not have to worry about the older students running over their youngsters.

The Annex was chosen to be the site of the new Leicle Bostic Traditional Magnet School beginning with the 1994-95 school year. Gammon lost around 60 children to Bostic. For the first time since Gammon opened in 1984, the facility was able to hold all of the students K-5.

In April 2000, the voters of the Wichita School District approved a $284.5 million bond issue. The projects began in the fall of 2000 and were completed over the next five years. The plan built 19 multipurpose rooms, upgraded science labs, replaced portable classrooms with permanent construction, improved handicap accessibility to all buildings, rebuilt five existing elementary schools, added a new elementary and middle school, expanded seven other elementary schools and provided nine new libraries as well as the expansion of nine others. Building infrastructure in 82 buildings was also upgraded, including the replacement of antiquated plumbing, updates and expansion of electrical systems, replacement of inefficient or broken windows and doors, upgrades of heating and cooling systems, and asbestos abatement when required.

National Contractors, Inc. was hired to complete the Beech, Gammon and Isely Bond projects. Gammon's Bond project dedication ceremony was held January 19, 2006.";"http://gammon.usd259.org/?sessionid=d218a0cd36195ea7a7b367b82043106a&t";;;"http://www.applitrack.com/wichita/onlineapp/default.aspx";"http://enroll.usd259.org/modules/groups/integrated_home.phtml?gid=1517591&sessionid=d218a0cd36195ea7a7b367b82043106a";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The lion, with wings, standing on the Word of God, is the symbol most often associated with St. Mark, the writer of the second Gospel.  We pray that our preschool helps grow ""Little Lions"" who are strongly grounded in the good news of the Bible that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died for their sins. 

Our director, Miss Carly Belz, and all the members of St. Mark enthusiastically seek to share Christ, his Word, and our gifts with you, our neighbors, here in Salina!

Our chief tools are an integrated, classical Christian curriculum and the example of devoted Christian teachers. Although ultimately geared towards college preparation, the course of study will also prepare students who decide not to pursue formal higher education for a lifetime of learning.

At one time there was a common body of knowledge which every citizen was expected to possess. Those fortunate enough to be formally educated, had, of course, more extensive knowledge, but the speeches, sermons, pamphlets, and newspaper articles of the day transcended educational boundaries due to that shared body of knowledge. Modern Americans have misplaced this, to our great loss. Our ability to speak to one another on a deep spiritual level or high intellectual plane is now limited, and our ability to reason together diminished.

Cair Paravel Latin School seeks to restore this lost heritage. We intend for our students to be liberally educated, spiritually grounded and physically fit. They will have experiences, including the challenges of travel, denied to many youngsters. Whatever vocation the Master may call them into, they will be prepared to serve—and serve well—which is the essence of leadership in the body of Christ.

By integrated education, we mean that the whole of knowledge is not so easily divisible into subjects as implied in our listing of courses. The best-educated students will see the connection and understand how the Word of God illumines and defines each subject and, therefore, all truth. This goal requires a special kind of teacher, not a narrowly-educated “specialist”, but a generalist dedicated to a lifetime of learning in his or her area of expertise, and beyond. In addition to trained educators, this can be a parent employed on a part-time basis, a situation we regard as one of the strengths of the CPLS program.";"http://www.cpls.org/";;;"http://www.cpls.org/about/employment/";"http://www.cpls.org/prospective-students/steps-for-admissions/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.cpls.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cpls_logo.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Spaght Science and Communications Magnet (previously Spaght Multimedia Magnet, Spaght Accelerated Magnet, Ingalls World of Knowledge Magnet, Ingalls Edison, and Ingalls Elementary School) was originally built in the 1900’s at Ninth and Cherry Street, which is now where the Dunbar site is located.  The first building was named Ingalls Elementary School in honor of John J. Ingalls, a famous 19th century United States Senator and lasted only a short time as it burned one month and five days later.  In 1927 contracts were set for a new school at Tenth and Grove.  Population in the area grew rapidly, resulting in four rooms being added to the structure in 1930 and an additional six rooms in 1952.   In 1962, 14 classrooms, a multipurpose room and a library were added. 
 
The integration process started at Ingalls in 1953 and continued until about 1957, when the school population was more than 50 percent black.  By the time it was 1969 only one white child attended which resulted in Ingalls being an assigned area for integration purposes in 1971-72.  There was a population of 80 percent white and 20 percent blacks in the school at this time. 
 
In the fall of 1992, the educational emphasis of Ingalls changed to a geographical approach and the school was renamed Ingalls World of Knowledge Magnet Elementary School.   
 
In the fall of 1997, the district granted a contract to the Edison Corporation and the name was changed to Ingalls Edison Academy.  This partnership lasted until the spring of 2002. 
 
In 2002, USD 259 terminated their contract with the Edison Corporation.  At this time the building was changed to Samuel E. Spaght Accelerated Magnet Academy and was dedicated to the memory of district administrator and lifelong supporter of children, Samuel E. Spaght.  Mr. Spaght served the Wichita Public Schools for 41 years before losing his battle with cancer in May 2000.

In 2008, the decision was made to overhaul the instruction integration focus and name  once again.  The world was changing and the need for preparing students for the real-world became more important than ever. Classrooms were equipped with the newest technology and multimedia resources while staff was trained on methods for implementing these new resources into all subject and content areas. The transition to Samuel E. Spaght Multimedia Magnet began.
 
A wonderful opportunity to enhance and refresh the current magnet theme came knocking on the door during the 2012-2013 school year. A national Magnet Schools of American Grant which allows magnet schools to integrate new elements through careful planning, guided trainings and student college and career readiness was awarded.
 
Spring of 2014, Samuel E. Spaght Science and Communications Magnet was born.";"http://spaght.usd259.org/";;"8:50-4:10";"http://www.applitrack.com/wichita/onlineapp/default.aspx";"http://enroll.spaght.usd259.org/modules/groups/integrated_home.phtml?&gid=1508227&sessionid=79a0370b2e657ede67b014ef9a60ee4d&__utma=253149270.1874847253.1436500011.1436753277.1436766213.7&__utmz=253149270.1436590296.5.4.utmcsr%3Dgoogle|utmccn%3D%28organic%29|utmcmd%3Dorganic|utmctr%3D%28not+provided%29&__utmc=253149270&__utmb=253149270.1.10.1436766213&__utmt=1";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

That day Annoor Islamic School (AIS) started as a one-classroom school covering preschool and consisting of 12 students. Alhamdulillah, AIS is now an accredited school equipped with certified teachers and preschool through 8th grade! Insha' Allah, we will continue to grow. The size of the student body has been increasing each year.

AIS is nesteled in a middle-class neighborhood overlooked from highway K-96. The neighborhood of the school is filled with many Muslim families. The masjid is attcahed to the school thereby enabling students to pray dhur and salatul Juma'a(Friday prayer).

At the same time that Mary took over the program, it became clear that it had outgrown the current available space. Mary worked to find another location.
In May of 1991, Special Beginnings Early Learning Center was opened and licensed for 120 children. Since 1991, Special Beginnings has grown and expanded significantly.
Summer 1996: Camp Special Beginnings begins. Located at the VFW Hall in Lenexa, and serves 60 school age children.
Spring 2000: Special Beginnings Olathe location opens. This location serves 60 children; Infants through Pre-Kindergarten.
Fall 2001: Special Beginnings After School Care opens. This program is now located at the V.F.W. in Lenexa, Kansas and provides quality care and educational programming for 60 children.
Fall 2008: Special Beginnings Cleveland Center opens. Located in the Cleveland Chiropractic College, this location is licensed for 105 children — ages infant to school age.
Together these multiple locations provide education and quality care for over 400 children every day.

Children are placed in groups of similar ages.  Each group is supervised by five clinical staff members. These groups stay together throughout the day so that children receive intensive experience in functioning as a group and in making friends. Each group spends two hours daily in classrooms conducted by special educators. These specialists carry out behavior modification programs designed to treat children's problems in a classroom context. Individualized instruction is also provided.

GMA is currently pursuing a rigorous, multi-year certification process through the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI), founded in 1929 “to maintain the integrity of her [Montessori’s] life’s work, and to ensure that it would be perpetuated after her death.” Through its certification and teacher training, AMI strives to maintain the principles of Dr. Montessori and thereby help students worldwide to reach their full potential in society. We currently offer three Children’s House classrooms and one Lower Elementary classroom each lead by a certified Montessori teacher and classroom assistant. We also have one classroom for our toddler program, which can have up to 16 children from age 2–3, lead by teachers with extensive childcare experience.

West Street Toy Box is an organization focused on all areas concerning your child, making quality care for your child our number one goal.

We appreciate the difficulty in deciding to place your child in a daycare facility. At West Street Toy Box, we understand this difficult decision and guide both you and your child through each step of this independence. We give your child the individual attention he or she needs to grow socially, cognitively, physically and emotionally in a safe, healthy environment. We clean and disinfect toys and play areas on a daily basis to help stop the spreading of germs. One comment that most parents and visitors make about our center is the cleanliness of the facility.

West Street Toy Box is family owned and operated, allowing us the opportunity to know you by name. We pride ourselves on this personal relationship. When a decision arises concerning your child, you have the right to feel comfortable knowing someone who cares will be there.

As parents, we recognize your need to know how your child's daily activities are preparing him or her for a lifetime of learning.

What makes our school unique is that we are convinced that Christian training is best done in the home, church, and school. In our school, Christ is the center of instruction in all our classes.

The owner, Geraldine Dolinar grew the business out of her own basement in Kansas City, Kansas. In the 1950s the words Childcare Center, Preschool, or even Daycare had yet to be spoken. The care of young children at that time usually fell to the local church or the domestic care giver. Few people thought about children’s education at such a young age in addition to their care, but Geraldine recognized this situation. She was not satisfied with the level of attention that the local children were receiving when it came to their education. At the time she had her third child (Her youngest daughter who is our current Regional Director), she saw an opportunity to the solve a problem in the local community, while also being able to care for her daughter.

During the late 1950’s another opportunity arose that helped this new venture gain traction: Women were entering the workforce and finding it hard to find care.  She networked with the women to in the community to find a sizable demand for women needing this service. She told the families of the community if she did decide to open a care center, that she would start an educational center, “a preschool… she would not be a babysitter”.  (Geraldine will correct anyone who calls Kiddi Kollege a Day Care to this day)

So, Geraldine decided to do it herself and develop an educational program. Ultimately, she became a entrepreneur while also giving her the option to care and educate her daughter. With her success she opened her first brick and mortar center in the mid 1960’s. She has always said that opening this business was one of her proudest accomplishments, and she was especially proud of opening up the business at a time when opportunities for women where scarce compared to today.

After opening her first center she started many traditions that set a standard among early education centers. To name a few, she had learning centers that included math, science, art, music, and manipulative play. Another tradition started at Kiddi Kollege is the preschool graduation. We conduct our preschool graduation every May. It is a great treat for the parents and every graduation is treasured by our parents and staff.

After the first center opened she continued to reinvest into her business later opening two more locations in Kansas City Kansas in the 1970’s. In the 1980’s she opened up two more locations in Olathe Kansas. The 6th & 7th Kiddi Kolleges where opened in Overland Park and Leawood. Now, the third Generation (Geraldine’s grandchildren) currently work in the centers and are looking ahead to the future, continuing to offer this valuable service to the community.";"http://www.kiddikollegechildcare.com/kk-contact-us.php";;;"http://www.kiddikollegechildcare.com/kk-employment.php";"http://www.kiddikollegechildcare.com/useruploads/files/kkinc._enrollment_form_update.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We strive to create a vital play based setting in which the children feel safe, challenged, and appreciated as individuals.  We view creative play as key to all the growth and learning that takes place during early childhood years.  A well-planned play space provides for a wide variety of experiences reflecting the child's natural interests and abilities.  Pre-school children learn best through repeated, concrete experiences involving as many of their senses as possible.  While offering structural activities for the children, we also believe in the importance of self directed, independent play, always remaining available to offer assistance and foster basic problem-solving skills.  We strive to provide a supportive, loving environment for the children, to encourage their growth in all areas, and to facilitate a successful transition between the early years at home with family and their future years ahead in school.";"http://www.portsidelearningcenter.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As teachers, we truly value the parent-teacher relationship and see it as a way to develop the program to better meet each child’s needs. We encourage parent volunteers and are working on ways to provide additional opportunities for parents to become more involved in our program. If you are interested, please see your child’s teacher.

Finally, it is important to us that families have a voice at First Step.

We, here at Circle Time Preschool and Childcare, feel that meeting each child's needs is essential for growth. We are sensitive to a child's social, emotional, intellectual, and physical needs. Circle Time provides a literature based program through constant exposure to books, poems, songs and the written language. We also offer opportunities for children to explore, create, play and succeed with the use of activity centers, each with a different focus, such as art, science, and dramatic play areas.

Children have different learning styles and pass through the stages at different times. Our multi-level center provides children with the opportunities to develop concrete thinking and social skills as well as to create a positive self image.

Learning is an active process. Children learn through repeated exposure, role modeling, and the opportunity to apply and practice what they have learned. The use of hands-on experiences allows children to manipulate and investigate their surroundings. Using hands-on and manipulative materials in the classroom provides children with the opportunity to explore and create their own method of learning.

Our role, as educators, is to be a dynamic link between the children and the classroom and to create an environment which allows children to:

    -Be successful
    -Develop a positive self esteem
    -Grow through decision making
    -Create the skills and knowledge necessary to interact with      others
    -Relate their skills to their day-to-day experiences
    -Establish a love for learning

As teachers we present concrete models and experiences to help children visualize an idea or concept. We use the classroom environment to build communication skills, develop creative thinking, teach problem solving and develop use of judgment. Through the learning process, education prepares the children socially, emotionally and mentally for the challenges of life.";"http://www.circletimepreschoolandchildcare.com/";;"7am-5:30pm";;;"http://www.circletimepreschoolandchildcare.com/handbook/Circle%20Time%20Handbook.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We provide an enriching atmosphere which enables the child to develop socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively. We offer a learning environment which provides developmentally appropriate experiences designed to stimulate these areas of growth. The children are involved in first hand experiences and opportunities for self exploration and discovery. They are encouraged to explore the world around them through free play and directed activities. Learning through play is the heart of our curriculum. Daily lesson plans are introduced through structured themes with the children's interests in mind. Through individual and group activities children learn about themselves, others and the world around them.   

 Children develop and learn on an individual basis. Working with children in small groups enables them to receive the personalized attention they need to excel. AIL staff has the opportunity to observe and meet the individual needs of each child and to share those observations with parents. AIL offers each child the individual care, attention, nurturing and love, which is necessary for healthy growth. At AIL we value the individuality of each child by recognizing differences and offering personal care and attention in a group setting.

Involving families at AIL is a top priority. With parent involvement with our staff children understand and  make the strong connection between home and center. We are an extension of the family, developing a partnership where sharing support, ideas and genuine love for children is of the utmost importance. At AIL We encourage parents to visit and participate in school activities. At AIL we have an open door policy; which means you are more than welcome to come and go as you please.

The schools also serve as teaching and learning labs for parents, teachers, early childhood education providers and college students to increase their knowledge and skill sets.

All grade levels provide students with balanced literacy instruction which includes reading, researching, and writing across the curriculum. Hands-on experiences from FOSS, AIMS, and GEMS enrich math and science programs. A wide variety of texts and computer programs enhance learning in all areas of the school's curriculum. Regular use of rubrics have helped improve students' writing. The school's leadership/data analysis team regularly analyzes tests data in order to monitor students' progress and to assist teachers in designing classroom experiences that meet students' needs.

The majority of teachers have advanced degrees while others are working toward this goal. Our teachers participate in many professional development opportunities in a variety of areas. These professional discussions provide opportunities for teachers to generate conversations related to applying best practices across the grade levels. The school has initiated PBIS as a behavioral management structure. There is also an after school program to assist students with increased achievement.

Our faculty works diligently to enable our students to enjoy and appreciate the arts through field trips, assemblies, and community involvement. Students participate in many school-to-work activities. Parents and community members further educate students by sharing experiences about their jobs during our career fair. Little Mountain Elementary School, the PTO, and the community work hard to keep our students continuously learning in a safe and caring environment.";"http://littlemountainelem.sc.nce.schoolinsites.com/";;;;"http://images.pcmac.org/SiSFiles/Schools/SC/NewberryCounty/LittleMountainElem/Uploads/Forms/01_FILLABLE_Registration_Packet_NEW.pdf";"http://littlemountainelem.sc.nce.schoolinsites.com/?PageName=%27Handbook%27";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Throughout the decades, Head Start has expanded their services to involve the whole family. Head Start supports families in give different component areas: health, nutrition, education, social services, and parent involvement.

Waldo County Head Start (WCHS) serves children ages three to five, four days a week, for 128 days per year. WCHS offers part-time (four hours a day) and full-times (six hours a day) options depending on the needs of the family. Placement is based on a number of criteria; the primary one is family income. There is no fee for WCHS programs.

Through fun games and activities your child will learn colors, shapes, counting to 20 and especially the alphabet letters and their sounds. 

Our basic kindergarten-readiness curriculum is “Letter of the Week.”  We explore each letter in many ways.  Young children learn best when they are active and using all their senses, so we’ll experience each letter not only by sight and sound, but also touch, taste and movement.  For example, during letter B week, we’ll have snacks of bananas, blueberries, bread and bagels, play with baseballs and basketballs;  in the science room we’ll read about bears, butterflies and beavers and in the art room working with brown and blue paint.  We’ll include exercise by jumping for j, dancing for d, marching for m, playing hopscotch and hula hoops for h, running a race for r and push-ups for p.

    Science is another curriculum area I’d like to focus on at Wind in the Willows.  The sciences curriculum includes animals, plants, seasons, weather and the environment.  We’ll talk about different kinds of animals, including mammals, reptiles, birds and insects, and where animals live, and what they eat, etc.  We’ll also learn about the 4 seasons and spend time outside observing the changes that occur with each season.  We have a short nature trail on the property and in good weather we’ll do a nature walk every day so the children can observe birds, collect leaves in the Fall, touch tree bark, etc.   In the Spring we will plant a school vegetable garden outside and each child will also get their own personal planter box, add soil and seeds and care for their plants.";"http://www.windwillowpreschool.com/Welcome.html";;"Morning session: 8:30 a.m. – 12 noon

This is recognized by those deeply concerned about early childhood education to be the best preparation for the years ahead.

To provide a safe and developmentally rich environment for children while their families have to be away. Children are growing and learning many things. Our job is to guide them in their physical, mental and emotional growth while you are at work. They are not perfect (nor are they expected to be); they have good days and bad days, just like adults.

All children learn at different rates. They learn best through naturally occurring events, and through play and activities that provide for autonomy, control and as much practice or repetition as is necessary to master new skills and to learn to develop their own interests. A thoughtful combination of teacher directed, child initiated, and classroom routines constitute our program. The environment is set-up to help children learn: who they are, what they are capable of and being part of a group. Messages will be clear and consistent. We believe that your family is your child’s first and most important teacher. Your perspective and insights, goals and desires of your child are essential to our providing a great program for him or her. Parents are always a welcome addition to our program.

Additionally, we believe that a learning environment that fosters respect for cultural diversity and that utilizes an open approach to education allows for optimal growth and development of your children.

We have the highest respect for children and their ability to progress through their childhood, developing at a steady pace. We strive to offer routines, activities and an atmosphere of fun and challenge.

In order to keep at-risk children and children with special needs in regular classrooms, the entire learning environment is being changed.  Usually teachers will subgroup students into small working units.  Sometimes a physical therapist or an occupational therapist or a speech language pathologist may enter the classroom to work with the teacher and specific children.  At-risk students have materials that are modified to meet their individual learning needs requiring individual teacher time and attention. The whole class participates in a process to help all children succeed in their education.

With all of this in mind, regular education and special education have been changing, slowly but surely.  The traditional regular classroom that most parents remember no longer exists.  It is important for parents to speak to their children about the fact that there may be not only new friends in class, but also special friends.  The diversity in regular classrooms has increased dramatically as children with at-risk learning needs or special needs remain in regular classrooms for longer periods of time.*

Circle of Learning was established in 2001 as a developmental preschool to help any two and a half to five year olds be ready for public school.  We serve children with a wide variety of disabilities as well as typically developing children when space has been available.  Circle of Learning has long recognized that one of the best ways to instruct special needs children is to have them learn with typically developing peers.  Our classroom on the University’s Presque Isle campus is an Inclusive Preschool where we will be offering a less restrictive learning environment for special needs children along with a typical preschool program for the faculty and students of UMPI as well as Presque Isle area children.  We are offering a morning only session and an all day session with afterschool care until 5pm.

Our classroom is rich in sunshine, natural wood and classroom materials unique to the Montessori approach. Our classroom will provide the structure children need to develop self discipline along with a sense of self which will be life sustaining.

Grace Montessori will offer your child opportunities to develop strong skills in math and reading. It is also strong in helping children develop independence as well as grace and courtesy. Your child will also learn about the world through use of maps, exploring cultures and the animals unique to each continent.
Grace Montessori
We will be offering lessons in foreign language, art and music through a specialist whose own children grew up with a Montessori experience. Here at Grace Montessori, we also strongly believe in connecting children with their natural environment. They will learn not only about themselves but also have firsthand experience in learning the strong connection between all living things. As they develop these skills, they will experience and understand how each of us has a role to play in our classroom, our environment and the world.

In my experience, I have found no other approach to education that puts as much emphasis on supporting the child to learn these important life sustaining lessons as much as learning traditional concepts such as math, reading, geography and science. It is the Montessori Approach that has given me permission and construct to teach the way I knew in my heart to be right, nurturing the whole child, mind, body and spirit. This is why I am so passionate about calling myself a Montessori Educator.
–Katherine Johnston, MEd.

Grace Montessori also includes a faith based perspective to their understanding. This includes prayer, faith based discussions and opportunities for each child to discover and build their own personal relationship with God.";"http://mygracemontessori.me/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Grace-Montessori-School/419871781444754";"Tue - Fri:

More importantly, they learn how to socialize, they make friends and learn to share and contribute. Your children will enter kindergarten with better pre-reading skills, richer vocabularies and stronger basic math and science skills.

Our program teaches kids how to be students. Your child will learn how to raise his/her hand, take turns, and share the teacher’s attention. Furthermore, he/she will learn how to separate from Mommy or Daddy! All of this makes for an easier transition to kindergarten. Kindergarten Teachers will tell you that the students who are ready to learn are those who come into school with good social and behavioral skills.

Children’s Express provides a place where your child can gain a sense of self, explore, play with his/her peers and build confidence. Kids in preschool discover that they are capable and can do things for themselves from small tasks to tackling bigger issues; like making decisions about how to spend their free time.

The skills a child learns at the early stages provide the foundation for all other skills that will be learned throughout life.

Trained and experienced Preschool Teachers are crucial to a successful preschool experience. For many children, preschool colors the way they will forever look at school; it is this first experience which will foster a lifelong love of learning and an overall sense of comfort and achievement within the preschool environment. Our Teachers will often take basic concepts and incorporate them into play. Children at this age learn through play concepts that incorporate all of their senses. While they are having fun and practicing essential social concepts such as being respectful of each other, taking turns, etc., they are unaware that they are even absorbing educational concepts. Our teachers are able to engage each child and offer lessons through these playful avenues. The most important qualification for preschool teachers is the ability to instill a joy of learning that stays with their young students for a lifetime!

The Children’s Express All Aboard curriculum is organized into theme based centers that address topics which encourage children to develop their skills and confidence. Each center incorporates language, math, science, creative arts, music, motor skills and social development.";"http://www.chexpressomaha.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Childrens-Express-Childcare-and-Learning-Center/200470086659271";"Mon – Fri: 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.chexpressomaha.com/wp-content/themes/childrensexpress/images/chexpress/logo.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The school, established in 1921 by the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, serves kindergarten through eighth grades.  In 1924, Monsignor Joseph Suneg, a devout priest and talented wood carver, became the pastor and administrator.  He opened the doors of the present school in 1951 and stayed until his retirement in 1969. His legacy still touches the lives of students as much today as it did in 1951.

As one of 32 elementary metropolitan schools of the Archdiocese of Omaha, Nebraska, St. Margaret Mary serves the needs of 535 students from its location in the central part of the city.  A 2 1/2 year renovation and expansion project of the school and parish began in 1996, with school improvements including mechanical and electrical renovations, as well as the addition of an elevator, administrative offices, handicapped accessibility, two computer labs, a new resource library, a music room, and a science lab. In 2007, a geothermal heating and air conditioning system, plus new thermal paned windows were added to the school building.

The foundation for such interaction is the St. Margaret Mary parish community, who is committed both spiritually and financially to the achievement of this philosophy.  Our desire is to encourage each member of the Saint Margaret Mary community to become personally responsible to God, self, family, and country.  Within this environment, it is the purpose of St. Margaret Mary School to produce happy, successful, active members of the Body of Christ and the community.

In 2008 St. Margaret Mary School was designated a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.

As we continue the second decade of the millennium, we are charged with the task of producing students who will be equipped to work and live in a global society that will demand much from them.  They will need to be members of the Body of Christ who are spiritually, emotionally, morally, intellectually, physically, socially and technologically equipped to live their lives based on the Gospel values and the Catholic Tradition.";"http://smmomaha.org/school/";"https://www.facebook.com/margaretmary.connect";;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://smmomaha.org/wp-content/themes/smm/img/logo.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Whereas parents provide the primary influence in the development of the child, the Christian teacher as a role model, witness, and servant also seeks to meet the needs of each child. The teacher adapts curriculum, teaching methods and structure so that the needs of the developmental whole child are met – physically, intellectually, socially, emotionally, aesthetically, as well as spiritually.

Trinity offers children eligible for kindergarten within the next two years two different classes to prepare them for kindergarten. 

One class is offered on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and is geared for three year-old children.  The other class is offered on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and is oriented for four-to-five year-old preschoolers.  The hours for each class are 8:15am-11:45pm.

Curriculum The purpose of Trinity Lutheran Preschool is to give your child a Christian environment in which to grow in self-esteem and develop at his/her individual rate of spiritual, emotional, mental, social and physical growth. Throughout the school year, assessment of your child is conducted through a portfolio that showcases your child’s proficiency in the Nebraska Early Learning Guidelines.

Established as a mission congregation to meet the spiritual needs of the many Germans from Russia who had migrated into Lincoln’s South Bottoms neighborhood, Immanuel has a long and storied history.

Immanuel is people with a mission. Our mission statement is simple: “One beggar showing other beggars where to find bread.” We implement that mission without tricks or gimmicks. Our pastor simply preaches and teaches that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was crucified for the sins of every man, woman and child — and by His death, we have forgiveness, life, and salvation.


We invite you to come and visit us. Join with us and hear the historic liturgy of the Christian Church, sing Christ-centered hymns to the sound of an organ, and be fed by God’s Word and Sacraments. Come to Immanuel and receive the bread of eternal life and hear the sweet message that you are forgiven in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.";"http://lincolnlutheranchurches.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=0&sobi2Id=7&Itemid=24";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This type of curriculum is based on the emotional, physical, social and cognitive needs of the individual child. The developmental needs of the child are used to determine appropriate activities carried out with that child. Because children grow and develop at different rates, this approach offers them the opportunity to explore each area of development at their own pace.

The staff of the Center creates an atmosphere of support and affection as well as provides the materials, equipment and experience required to optimize the experiences of each child. They also serve as examples to the children, since children learn as much by observing others as they do by direct instruction. The teaching staff acts as facilitators rather than the directors of activities.

The Indianola and the Red Willow School Districts met as a combined school district on June 26, 1969 to hold the first school board meeting for the newly formed Republican Valley School District.  Beginning with the 1969-1970 school year, students combined to form the Republican Valley Schools.

The Wilsonville School District combined with the Beaver Valley School District on September 1, 1983.  An elementary attendance center remained in Wilsonville until the mid-90’s.

The Bartley and Beaver Valley School Districts officially became the Twin Valley School District on March 1, 1997.  An elementary attendance center remained at the building in Danbury with Junior-Senior High students combining for the 1997-1998 school year in Bartley.

The Marion School District decided to close the doors of their K-8 district and combine with the Twin Valley District on August 1, 1998 following state legislation ruling Class I school districts affiliate with a kindergarten-grade twelve district.

The Twin Valley and Republican Valley School districts legally merged on August 1, 2003 following a majority vote of the patrons of both districts on March 25, 2003 to issue bonds to build a new building in Bartley and merge both districts.  The Twin Valley fourth grade students were transported to the Republican Valley Elementary School in Indianola for the 2003-2004 school year, and the district’s preschool was located in Bartley.  A cooperative agreement between both districts allowed students participating in cross country, junior high sports, track and golf to combine during the 2003-2004 school year.  

On October 13, 2003, the Board of Education approved the newly formed district’s name and mascot as the Southwest Public School Roughriders.  A motion by the School Board on November 10, 2003 approved the school colors as navy blue, Carolina blue, and white.  The school name, mascot, and colors were approved following a vote of the student body.  The remaining grades of each district officially began classes as one district for the 2004-2005 school year with grades six through eight located at the Bartley site and grades nine through twelve at the rural Republican Valley High School site.  Elementary students will continue to receive their education at the building in the City of Indianola.  The final drawing of the official Roughrider mascot was approved at the February 9, 2004 Board of Education meeting.  Contractors began work on the new building site at Bartley in March of 2008.  Occupation of the new building took place on November 13, 2009.";"http://www.swpschools.org/";;;"http://www.swpschools.org/vnews/display.v/SEC/District|Job%20Opportunities";;"http://www.swpschools.org/vnews/display.v/ART/4e5bae3cea3b9";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In 2011, Westmoor celebrated 50 years of successful education with a community open house.

With and enrollment of just over 400 students, Westmoor has three  to four sections of each grade with classroom sizes ranging from 16-23 students. The building is fortunate to house the districts Multi-Categorical Special Education Program, which consists of three additional classrooms. The inclusion of special needs students develops a caring and accepting attitude of people's differences in all students.

Westmoor students utilize the Accelerated Reader and the Accelerated Math programs. These two programs are supplementary to the regular reading and math curriculum and provide excellent differentiation for all students. Students that master math objectives and reading levels earn certificates and awards. As a result of excellent curriculum and teaching, Westmoor students have met the Adequate Yearly Progress goals as set by federal legislation, No Child Left Behind, and boast one of the highest percentages of high ability learners in the district.

Most people in Elgin remember the building as the old Park Center School. The School was located 10 miles west of Elgin on highway 70. Several years after the school closed it was moved into Elgin by the Historical Society ('98). It sits on a lot on Bowen street right off highway 14. The building was in rough shape and screaming for some much needed attention. My Husband and I began talking about the need for more daycare in Elgin. I have a 4 year old son and we had just had a son and I was wanting to work closer to home. We started throwing around the idea of opening a daycare center in Elgin. Bruce said he knew the perfect place. We spoke with a member of the Historical Society and she said that they were talking about selling the building. When I first seen the building I didn't know what to think. The inside was almost as bad as the outside. But I guess I underestimated my Husband alittle. We purchased the building and began the remodel at the end of February. In no time the project took off!!! I was amazed at how quickly it began to look like a daycare. Our initial thought for an opening date was July 1st, but we were so far ahead of schedule we moved our opening date to June 4th!! We figured the building had sat empty for long enough we were anxious to say the least to get kids running and playing in the building once again! Now we have been open for 4 months and things are going great. We have new children enrolling about every week and we always have room for drop ins. It is hard to find a job that you like and very rare to find one that you love so I consider myself a very lucky person because I love what I do!!

We make life changing impact to the children, adults and families we serve through programs that focus on three key areas: youth development, healthy living and social responsibility.

As an organization, we strive to understand our community needs. We provide services and programs that cater specifically to the issues our children, families and neighborhoods face.  Through crucial partnerships with over 150 not-for-profit agencies, schools and organizations we are working hard to reach as many people as possible and making a lasting difference.

The Y is open to all people regardless of their ability to pay for programs and services, and as a result we provide over $1,000,000 of financial assistance each year.  By investing in our kids, our health and our neighbors, the YMCA of Greater Omaha ensures that everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to thrive—thereby strengthening our community.

The NOLC has served more than three thousand young people over the past forty-two years--approximately 97% of our children have not had contact with the court system. 

 The NOLC's programs are nationally recognized for their success in building strong character, social values, 

and resiliency to drugs and alcohol. Former President George H. Bush named the NOLC the nation's 535th Point of Light in 1991. The late Joe Edmonson, NOLC's co-founder and director, received local, state, and national honors for his service to the youth of Omaha, including the Ike Friedman Community Service Award by the Knights of AK-SAR-BEN, the Otto Swanson Spirit of Service Award, and an honorary doctorate in humanitarian service from Creighton University. 

 All youth need adult role models who can inspire. By participating in the NOLC's activities and programs, inner city youth come in regular contact with compassionate, capable adults--NOLC's staff, coaches, recreation and computer aides, tutors, and community volunteers who offer support, guidance, and the encouragement to succeed in school and life. These mentor relationships allow the NOLC to steer its youth in positive social, academic, and vocational directions, and also provide the means for staff to proactively monitor each student's progress.

At Nana's Little World, we provide the kind of well-rounded, enriching, educationally focused care that children deserve and parents seek.

Nana's Little World is committed to providing children, families and staff an educational environment where trust, care and service will promote each individual's opportunity for success.

From the time your child enters our doors until the time he/she leaves, there are countless opportunities for learning and growth. Our caring, observant and responsive staff are trained to stay constantly involved in every aspect of your child's day. At Nana's Little World, we create opportunities for your child to learn even while he/she is playing. Some of the best learning happens without children even knowing it! We also work directly with ""Kids Squad"" which is affiliated with The Child Savings Institute, in making this daycare/Preschool center one of the best.

Nana's Little World believes the earliest years are the most important for any child's development.

We know learning begins at birth. Your child develops and changes the most over the first few years of life. Nana's Little World strives to provide a safe, caring, and nurturing learning environment.

We also offer age appropriate curriculum to enhance your child's development. As children learn new things, they need continual, positive reinforcement from both parents as well as staff and teachers to better build their development of self-esteem to be confident and successful throughout their developing years.

The continuous training required of our staff always meets and often exceeds the standards for state licensed child care services. We require staff to participate in on-going professional development programs, as it insures everyone is providing the best care possible for your child.

Our goals are to help meet the needs of your child by helping him/her grow emotionally, socially, academically, and physically. This will be accomplished in the following ways:

    Building up a positive self-concept daily.
    Providing a safe, positive, and stable learning environment.
    Learning to interact by sharing, caring, problem solving, and respecting each other.
    Providing exploratory and guided play.
    Encouraging language development.
    Learning values such as honesty, respect, and cooperation.
    Providing activities to develop small and large motor skills.
    Providing hands on learning centers and activities that help build pre-literacy skills and early math and science awareness.

Learning at South Platte Preschool takes place in a hands on active learning environment through teacher directed activities as well as child initiated play. The academics highlighted each day will be done during teacher directed times; however, on a daily basis the children are engaged in activities that provide social/emotional, literacy, language, cognitive, creative, and physical growth.

1118842;"Small Wonders Child Care";"56 Armstrong Avenue";"Lisbon";"NH";3585;"GRAFTON";6038381049;"http://smallwondersfcc.weebly.com/";;"Small Wonders Family Child Care ""To learn and explore with new friends"" Small Wonders Family Child Care, located in Lisbon, opened its doors in 1993 as a license exempt child care and became licensed in 2000. Kathy Wright, owner and director, has envisioned a thoughtful, purposeful environment for the children and families at the center. Her ideas became reality this year upon the completion of her newly renovated, custom designed child care space. Small Wonders has a Bartering Payment Assistance Program which allows parents to use their skills within their profession in exchange for child care time for their family. When a parent, (fondly referred to as Mr. Bill) lost his job, Kathy’s family hired him to repair their camper. They were then able to sell the camper and use the money to pay Mr. Bill to do carpentry work at the child care. Mr. Bill gave them a discounted rate for his services. As a result, Mr. Bill’s children, who had been at Small Wonders since infancy, were able to remain at the center, and the Small Wonders environment could become what it is today: custom made cubbies in a large, open welcome area, a room specifically for afterschool children, many built-ins such as a dollhouse with different textures and colors on every level, bench seating, bookshelves, a puzzle shelf, a magic castle, and so much more.

We encourage you to visit the Small Wonders Family Child Care website at http://smallwondersfcc.weebly.com to see photos of the center and to learn more about the program.

In fact it may even appear to be growing! The Children’s Greenhouse offers a unique approach to fostering the development of the whole child. Rather than focusing on what the child is learning we focus on how the child is learning.
    We do this is by providing children with quality experiences that nurture their natural curiosity to learn.  Our children are never confined to tables when lessons are implemented. Classroom curriculums aren’t ever limited to one particular theme. Children aren’t told to stop working on an activity they’ve made progress on because their activity time has ended. Our teachers will never take away opportunities for the children to learn from their mistakes by offering only moderate challenges and intervening at the first signs of frustration.
   At The Children’s Greenhouse we recognize that each child is unique, which is why our mission is unique. Our teachers use an emergent curriculum, and our classrooms have been thoughtfully designed to foster growth and teach every child to be resourceful, take initiative, innovate, adapt, and be inspired by overcoming challenges.
    The Children’s Greenhouse encourages parents to come in and observe our classrooms, meet our dedicated staff, and experience The Children’s Greenhouse first hand.  We are looking forward to partnering with the children and families of Merrimack and its surrounding communities, and hope a visit will captivate and inspire your curiosity!

It has a student enrollment of about 415 children served by a faculty of about seventy dedicated and energetic people. Class sizes range from 18-25 children depending upon grade.


The curriculum includes math, reading, writing, language arts, science and social studies.  In addition, children  receive instruction  in technology, art, music, physical education and library.  Literacy is orchestrated using the “Reader's Workshop” framework. In mathematics, EDMES will be piloting a few different programs this year. A couple of grade levels will continue to use  the ""Four Frames"" framework, which we have been using for years.  The school’s PACE program provides enrichment and additional challenge to students.  Help is available at all grade levels through our Remedial Reading, English as a Second Language  and Special Education departments.  To gather data to help inform instruction, the Developmental Reading and Northwest Evaluation Association Assessments are administered to students at various times during the school year. East Derry Memorial is also  a member of the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports  (PBIS) network, and as such, we hold very high expectations for the  respect, responsibility and safety displayed by the members of our school community.


The school’s faculty participates regularly in a variety of professional development opportunities provided by the Derry Cooperative  School District.  Workshops in areas such as literacy, mathematics, assessment, technology, differentiated instruction, curriculum mapping, special education and other best instructional practices are offered on an ongoing basis.  District committees monitor, review and revise curriculum  throughout the year.


The school has an active and vibrant PTA.   Some of the events that the PTA has sponsored each year have been a Fall Festival, Sweet Heart Dance and Holiday Shopping.  PTA fundraisers have helped teachers to purchase  technology, classroom items, provided support for field trips,  paid for enrichment assemblies, and invited artists in residence to the school.  Several years ago, the PTA raised over $60,000 to replace the school’s playground equipment.


East Derry Memorial Elementary School is a wonderful place for children to learn and grow.  The school’s success is reflective of the efforts of students, parents, educators, and other community members working together on behalf of children.";"http://eds.sau10.org/";;;;;"http://eds.sau10.org/home/edmes-handbook";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://eds.sau10.org/_/rsrc/1345655758137/config/Screen%20shot%202012-08-22%20at%201.15.19%20PM.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition to our new kindergarten and first grade students, we anticipate all of the children to be excited and eager to learn.  Our fantastic faculty is also tremendously enthusiastic and motivated to help inspire your children learn and grow.  

South Range School continues to have a very active PTA and a strong volunteer program.  The PTA brings great opportunities to all of our students.  The PTA brings our school several cultural arts assemblies throughout the year.  They sponsor many evening socials and fun game nights.  The PTA helps reduce the families' out of pocket expense by partially funding field trips.  Also our volunteer program is just as strong as ever.  South Range School has been recognized for the  Blue Ribbon Volunteer Award annually over the past 30 years.  

We will begin our Good Citizenship program this year with three South Range expectations.
    1. Be Safe
    2. Be Respectful, Kind and Polite
    3. Do Your Best 
We feel that these are umbrella expectations that sum up all desired behaviors.  South Range students are always well behaved and considerate to others, however, it is always nice when you can make strong qualities stronger.  After the September focus on the three school expectations, we will continue the monthly focus and weekly quotes/reminders about attitudes, cooperation, friendships, respect, caring… 

At South Range School, we pride ourselves on our strong family-friendly bond and traditions.  We are considered to be a school where no one wants to leave.

At the heart of our philosophy is the need to foster the social, emotional, and physical growth of your child.

Our play-based program is centered on the premise that children learn best by doing. Children are guided and directed by the teacher through both structured activities and self-directed play. This allows the children to develop skills they need to participate in a group, as well as ample opportunity to explore and experiment independently with the wide range of materials set out each day. Using the guidelines established by the National Association for Education of Young Children (NAEYC), teachers develop curriculum around various learning themes. Within a theme, activities are planned to help children develop skills in all areas: social and emotional, language, science, math, imagination, art, music, and gross and fine motor. The classroom atmosphere is one of cooperation and mutual respect in which our children can play, learn, and thrive.

Some adults consider play as something frivolous and a complete waste of time. But, to the young child, play is very serious business requiring deep concentration. Play is a time to be absorbed in painting a picture, building with blocks or being a “Grandfather” in a dramatic play area. The feelings are earnest and intense.
A child engrossed in play is a lot like an adult working on a project he/she loves or an artist enthralled in their creation.

Play is a time for thinking, a time to solve problems and a time to investigate. Play is a time to organize thoughts. Play is a time to use mind and body, along with the social skills possessed, to respond to an idea or situation.

Play is a time to learn from each other and learn about the world in which they live!

The “work time” element of our curriculum has a playful quality as describes above. Children work individually or in small groups and flow from task to task. The teacher’s role is to provide challenging stimulus and expand upon the child’s learning, guiding their development. As the children “play/work” teachers are busy hearing what they say, “reading” each child’s face and sensing what is on their minds. The observations create the agenda for future plans with the children as individuals and as a group.

 Our Staff has 20 Plus Years of Preschool and Childcare Experience. Our teachers are Early Childhood Degreed and Certified. All staff members are CPR and 1st Aid Certified.

Your child will benefit from having small class sizes by getting more personal attention, more hands on experience, closer bonds with teacher and friends and overall better quality of care.

The main goals of preschool are to have fun, improve social skills, develop self-esteem, and encourage creative expression. A variety of activities are utilized to accomplish these goals: reading, arts & crafts, music & singing, dancing, dramatic play, puzzles, water exploration, sensory play, etc. This will not be a rigorous academic program as young children learn best through play!

Almost Angels has a large indoor area for the children to move freely. The room is very bright and cheerful with plenty of hands on equipment as well as a variety of play materials. Child size furniture and plenty of art and craft supplies are on hand for the children to explore daily.

Outside is a large play area with swings, slides, climbers, sandbox, riding toys, and plenty of room to run and have fun with friends.

I feel truly rewarded to work with children on a daily basis. I love my job very much and get great pleasure in seeing the children head off to school. It is such a wonderful feeling knowing I had such an impact on a child's life. Almost Angels Preschool offers a wonderful environment for the children to develop and grow. I provide the highest quality care of children and achieve this through experience, education and my love for children.

Curriculum topics, ideas, and activities for all children are developed based on common interests of the children, staff, and families we serve. We believe in a child-centered philosophy in which we encourage and promote social/emotional, physical, and cognitive development through a variety of learning opportunities, including early literacy, science, math, art, music and movement, and dramatic play. Each classroom bases interactions, environment, and curriculum on developmentally appropriate practice for the ages served.

As child advocates, we respect each child as an individual. We appreciate that all children learn through a variety of ways, and that each is developing at their own pace. We believe that family is the most important factor on a young child’s development, and we acknowledge and respect the many forms of diversity that each family brings to our school community.

The staff at Elliot Child Care strongly encourages family involvement throughout the year. We offer many opportunities to share ideas and opinions, including parent meetings, parent conferences, and day-to-day communication.

By always making a child feel safe, secure and respected, the child will explore and play to make sense of their curious surroundings.

Using a hands-on approach, we seek to develop creative self-discovery through fostering a child's natural curiosity and love of literature, science, art, music and culture.

We strive to provide your child with a happy, fun-filled learning experience and to help them become peaceful citizens. With our overlying theme of World of Wonder we hope to inspire and excite each child to appreciate all the wonders of their world and their part in the larger world.

Each month, we will take your child on a journey of enlightenment with themes such as The Wonders of You; The Wonders of Art & Music; The Wonders of the Earth; The Wonders of Light; The Wonders of Transportation; The Wonders of the Rainforest; The Wonders of the Farm;  The Wonders of Water and The Wonders of Your Back Yard. Each unit, as a group, we will open the ""Door of Discovery"" into our unique large tented environment where the children will first be introduced to the monthly theme.

In our effort to serve, Watermelon Seeds believes in nurturing the needs of our children and our community.

Creative Curriculum Model (http://www.teachingstrategies.com/page/73749-creative-curriculum-preschool.cfm), which is aligned with the NH Kindergarten Readiness Indicators.  Our activities are developmentally-appropriate and meet each child's individual developmental objectives.  Children are given hands-on opportunities to explore their environment and world around them.  Each day there are activities for literacy, mathematics, social studies, science, creative representation and music and movement.    

Our daily schedule offers children many opportunities for social-emotional development through free play and cooperative activities during our morning choice time.  Children are split into primary care groups which allows for more one-on-one experiences between teacher and child. 

Our playground has recently been renovated and new learning areas are continuing to be added to the space.  We have a few garden beds which allow us to follow the Early Sprouts Curriculum.  Through this curriculum children are offered experiences and opportunities to grow, eat and cook with bell peppers, beans, tomatoes, butternut squash, Swiss chard and carrots.  Children will gain the knowledge in taking care of living things along with exploring health, nutrition, and cooking.

We believe that human diversity is integral to the care and education of young children and to all those who touch their lives. Diversity at Oz Land can be defined as ""a fully inclusive community that is enriched by persons of different races, genders, ethnicities, nationalities, economic backgrounds, ages, abilities, sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, and religious beliefs."" Our goal is to promote awareness and acceptance, affirm equity, and take an active stance against bias in our community.
We strive to respect and value the differences in each child and family in our community through all that we do. We value the development of strong relationships with families and colleagues in order to better understand how we can respond to cultural and historical differences in experiences, values, and practices. We offer an environment that welcomes and celebrates the sharing of family history and culture in the classroom in meaningful ways. In our curriculum we are intentional in providing children with opportunities to explore similarities and variation, and we are responsive to the questions that emerge.

We support children in being active participants in their world by connecting them to their community in ways that foster an understanding of diversity and an ability to effect change. We are committed to an open and ongoing dialogue among colleagues, families, and the students we mentor, seeking insight into how we contribute to social bias and the process of change.

We are a community of students and teachers and families, who live and learn together. We try to live by our School Prayer, which urges kindness and an eagerness to “bear the burdens of others.” St. Paul’s is academically rigorous, but staffed with teachers who take the time to know the whole student, whether in the classroom, in the dormitory, on the athletic fields, or along one of the many paths that wind through the campus. Because high school is such a formative time, most alumni tell us that they made their most enduring friendships at St. Paul’s.

The teachers provide the routines and rituals of the days, weeks and seasons, allowing for a secure and rich environment for the unfolding of each child.

The day begins with free play. Our simple wooden and handmade toys become whatever the child imagines—puppet shows are performed, bridges and roads are built for trucks, houses and living spaces are made and remade—while the children transform into queens and kings, kittens, cooks, doctors and astronauts.
Holding this space for play, the teachers are engaged in practical activities the children can enter at will: peeling carrots and washing fruit for morning snack, folding napkins for the setting of the table, molding beeswax with warm fingers and felting wool.

the use of fine and gross motor skills as well as language and cognitive skills.  These skills are not “taught” in isolation, instead they are used as part of an experience that is joyful and highly motivating to the child.

Our classrooms are designed to be a safe, comfortable, culturally secure place where children can take chances in learning.  Our schedules, activities and interactions are designed to emphasize the development of commonly shared values, such as trust, honesty, empathy, respect, cooperation, responsibility and resilience.  
 
We believe that the development of these qualities helps children prepare to be lifelong learners. We look forward to sharing your child's journey through childhood.

It’s child-centered program strives to achieve a balance between offering new experiences and incorporating students’ interests and abilities.

Early childhood experiences lay the foundation for future educational, social, and emotional success. A positive early childhood education provides children with an open outlook on future experiences. Through cooperative play, small and large group activities, and hands on experiences children build confidence and a sense of self in a school setting.

At the Walpole Village School we provide a safe and stimulating environment for children to learn and socialize. We provide guidance to allow children to make kind, respectful choices in their school community. Children are challenged to explore the classroom space through a variety of age appropriate themed activities. We encourage our children and families to work cooperative with each other, the school, the community, and the environment to have a positive impact in the world.

The goal of the Walpole Village School is to meet the needs of the community by offering preschool and pre-kindergarten classes, as well as early morning care and an aftercare program for school age children. Working with the community to provide a safe, fun, and stimulating environment for children to grow and thrive is of great importance to us. At the Walpole Village School we aim to maintain a strong sense of community by continuing to be a fixture in the Village of Walpole.

Our students have 4 acres to explore: a play ground with a nature space, sand box, swing sets, greenhouses and plenty of room to run. One of our greenhouses provides an indoor play space for rainy days and a second greenhouse is where our students explore nature by growing their own food in our school garden. We grow crops year round. Students enjoy time in the greenhouses each week, all year long. It is another way the Walpole Village School is building a solid healthy foundation for our students successful future adventures in life.

Learning activities and materials should be concrete, real, and relevant to a child’s life, while providing a wide range of complexity and challenge so as to meet each child’s developmental and cognitive needs.

The Project Approach emerges from children’s ideas and interests. Each project allows children the opportunity to question, experiment, plan, sustain interest, work toward long-range goals and develop problem solving skills. Curriculum is naturally integrated as children represent and record their observations and knowledge through art, science, math, language, writing, music and creative play. By working on projects that are meaningful to them, children develop important social skills such as working cooperatively, sharing ideas, listening to others, negotiating compromises, and sharing ownership in the completed project.

A Hallmark of The Children’s Garden is the exceptional creativity that emerges as children are encouraged to explore a wide variety of materials and express themselves in many ways. The school becomes a kaleidoscope of color and texture through displays of children’s work. Each year is unique, as each group of children creates a collective memory of their preschool experience.

We are staffed by trained professionals that hold an interest in Early Childhood Education. The staff are picked for their dedication to young children and their joy and excitement of the love of learning. Each caring individual is carefully chosen to meet the individual needs of each classroom and brings with them a special gift to share as we all Live and Learn together.

In 1974, Live & Learn started as a dream to enable children to experience an alternative early learning center environment. It began as a Summer based program; and, in June of 1978, Live & Learn became a year round program that services community needs with a multi-program approach. Over the years, the school has developed into a center-based program on a functional 35 acre farm.

Each program at Live & Learn is based on experiential education, which allows children to explore their environment using a ""hands on"" approach. We give children the opportunity to experience a number of developmentally appropriate activities, both in and out of the classroom. Each program is staffed to meet the particular needs of the classroom. The staff, as well as the director, continually improves their education and understanding of young children through courses, seminars, and lectures within the field.

Live & Learn is accredited by the National Association of Education for Young Children (NAEYC), which holds the highest standards of quality for early learning centers in the nation. Lead teachers are provided a membership of NAEYC and the state chapter NHAEYC. NHAEYC works to promote quality early childhood education for the children of NH by supporting the Early Childhood Profession.

Live & Learn is also accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (NAC) under the National Association of Child Care Professionals (NACCP). Live & Learn is proud to be the only center in New Hampshire that is accredited by this agency.
Live & Learn was the first Nature Explore Certified Outdoor Classroom in the state of NH. This year marks our 5th year being recertified! Follow the link below to learn about the changes we've made over the year! This certification fits with our nature based curriculum and belief in connecting children with nature on a daily basis.

Its philosophical foundation is the work of Dr. Maria Montessori, carried forth by educators with specialty study in the Montessori Method. The school was established in 1979 by Meredith Goodrich.

Teacher training is through The Association Montessori Internationale, the American Montessori Society, The Montessori Center of North America and university programs in Early childhood, and Elementary Education. The school operates under licensing rules and regulations of the State of NH.

Classrooms are designed as prepared environments in which the child may interact directly. Through constant observations the teachers assess the needs of their children individually and collectively, and tailor the environment to them. It is through the child’s direct interaction with the classroom that he is encouraged to meet his own needs and feel the inner joy of self empowerment.

The world is our educational environment; it is funneled through the arts and through the sciences at our school. This integrated curriculum is processed by the child through sequence and order as he sorts and classifies the impressions he receives. He learns best by loving and this is the essence of the program.

The Montessori School strives to create a program which minimizes stress in a child’s life and maximizes balance, self-respect and inborn aptitudes. Through cooperative efforts of the school, staff and parents we can give a child a life long gift.";"http://www.montessorischoolofexeter.com/about-us/contact-map";;;;"http://www.montessorischoolofexeter.com/admissions/enrollment-info";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.montessorischoolofexeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/logo.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our philosophy is to allow children to celebrate their differences, recognize their similarities, and grow in self-esteem and self-worth. Our teachers give equal encouragement to individuality and cooperation.  In this way, each child learns to be an integral and contributing member of the group through the confidence that a strong sense of self and individuality brings.

Art, music and dance are central to our teaching philosophy and provide a means for stimulating and facilitating the learning process. These creative and essential means of expression are integrated into the children's daily experience at De Colores whether through structured lessons and group activity or on an individual basis.

At De Colores we provide children with an introduction to Spanish. Many of the fundamentals we cover are done in both Spanish and English. In addition, Spanish songs, games and poems are incorporated into the children's daily experience, further enhancing their basic understanding of the language.

In addition to fundamentals such as numbers, shapes, and learning days and months, our curriculum is composed of two themed units. During the 2010-11 school year, the ocean filled our days in the first months of school followed by an all-encompassing study of plant life that filled the second part of the year. The children explored various aspects of each theme in a multitude of ways - through stories, art, song and hands-on experience. In the ocean unit, they learned about ocean life, habitats, ecosystems and shore birds. In the plant unit, they learned how plants grow, the parts of the flowers and trees, and ultimately grew a plant of their own. Both units culminated with the creation of a picture book that allowed each child to show what they had learned.

At the end of the school year, we do an in-depth study of a renowned painter. In this unit, we focus on one painter, learning about his or her life and work and the children create artwork. in the artist's style. Artists about whom we have learned in previous years include Picasso, Monet, O'Keefe, Rothko, Klee, Van Gogh and Matisse. This year, the artist we explored was the Spanish painter, Joan Miro. We have had the children take a close look at many of his paintings and through this study they have learned to recognize commonalities that are specific to his work. At the end of this unit, they gained a more tactile understanding of Miro's work by emulating one of his paintings.

At De Colores, seasons, holidays, themes and units are studied in depth through a hands-on and interdisciplinary approach. Life isn't slotted into labeled boxes, rather it is experiential on a multitude of levels. Songs, stories, dance, art, math, writing, and hands-on activities are tied together at De Colores and brought to life through cohesive themes, which, in turn enhance a child's learning experience.";"http://decoloreschildrenscenter.com/";;"Half Day is from 8:00 - 12:00

We are one of eight accredited schools in Rockingham County. We provide high quality early childhood education and care while maintaining school hours of 6:30-5:30 (with an open door policy), to accommodate families busy schedules. Our educational programs for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and kindergartners are based upon NAEYC's best practices and are aligned with NH Department of Education’s Early Learning Standards. Our preschool students transition to kindergarten with the foundation they need for their academic success, some as early readers. Approximately 95% of our kindergartners leave our program as successful early readers. We track each child's developmental progress by building individualized portfolios over the course of the year, infants through kindergarten. The portfolios contain samples of the child's work, documentation of developmental accomplishments, photographs, and documentation of curriculum explaining the goals and objectives of the activities with the child's participation in it. These portfolios create a story of the child's experience in the classroom and validate the child's work within the classroom.

Appleseeds successfully provides nurturing and safe environments for all of our students while focusing on building long lasting trusting relationships with each student and their family. The children only transition once a year to their next classroom in large groups so they are able to maintain established friendships and have a sense of security as they move on to their next classroom. We pride ourselves in the longevity of our teachers. 30% of our teachers have been teaching at Appleseeds for over 10 years and 69% of our teachers have been teaching at Appleseeds for over 5 years. Because of the longevity of our teachers, students and their families have a sense of comfort and security as they transition to the next classroom. Children will often bring their work to their past teachers to show their accomplishments to them. There is a true sense of community as you enter the school. Families get to know one another and develop friendships outside of school. The relationships developed between teachers and families last through the years as well. We often hear how unique Appleseeds is when it comes to the atmosphere at our school and sense of community and partnership.
 
Appleseeds has been featured in several articles in the local newspapers for work on giving back to the community.  This includes the in-school lemonade stand our preschoolers hosted for NHSPCA, the collection for the Ladies of Liberty that our kindergarten class organized and our annual drives for the NH Foodbank and WIC.

""Above all,"" John Phillips stated, ""it is expected that the attention of instructors to the disposition of the minds and morals of the youth under their charge will exceed every other care; well considering that though goodness without knowledge is weak and feeble, yet knowledge without goodness is dangerous, and that both united form the noblest character, and lay the surest foundation of usefulness to mankind.""

Exeter today continues the commitment to unite knowledge and goodness. It seeks students who combine proven academic ability, intellectual curiosity, and tenacity with decency and good character. At the Academy, exacting inquiry and thoughtful discourse foster the life of the mind, instruction and activity promote fitness and health, and the daily interactions of a residential school nurture integrity, empathy, and kindness. Because learning and growth at Exeter arise from each individual's engagement with others, the richness of education here requires diversity in all its dimensions; students and faculty value the differences they bring to the community they share.

The challenges that students meet at Exeter and the support they receive have a common purpose: to stimulate their development as individuals and as members of society. Exeter seeks to graduate young people whose creativity and independence of thought sustain their continuing inquiry and reflection, whose interest in others and the world around them surpasses their self-concern, and whose passion for learning impels them beyond what they already know.

Our two story building is filled with books, art supplies, and toys. We have constantly changing activity centers and sensory tables. Windows let in plenty of light, and the décor is such that children feel welcome and ready to learn. Not all of the fun takes place indoors; we offer two outside safe spaces, a fenced-in playground with equipment that includes a playhouse, climbing structure, and of course…a sandbox! There is also a working garden where the children can explore nature.

Structured group activities teach listening skills, speaking skills and self-control. Students develop interpersonal skills by taking turns, making friends, sharing, being respectful and working as a team.

Music, literature, art, dramatic play, field trips and classroom visitors are some of the ways children learn. They develop eye-hand coordination along with their creative expressiveness and positive self-esteem. Through their play and various learning centers within the school, they learn math, alphabet recognition, science and nature and the world around them.

We understand that your child will need time to transition into our center.  This time varies with each child depending on age and prior experience.  We would like to help with this transition by providing these helpful hints:

· Visit the center before he/she begins attending the program.  Leave your child alone for 10-15 minutes.  This will allow your child to associate your leaving with a return.  It will also allow you time to observe your child at play with other children.

· Develop a drop off routine with your child.  This may include reading a book or playing a game.  Spending time in the classroom communicates to your child that this is a good place to be and not one to rush away from.

· Let your child bring in a family photograph to look at during difficult times.

· Always say goodbye to your child rather than “slipping away”.  This reassures him that although you are leaving you will be back.

At Rye Country Day School, children, parents, and teachers enjoy the pleasure of playing, working, communicating, problem solving, serving, exploring, inventing, and building a stronger community. Together we strive to make sense of our world and discover ways we can help to make it better by modeling respect, acceptance, and friendship.

At Rye Country Day we provide a learning community for children and adults: a place where children are valued for their ability to do meaningful work, their wonder and curiosity, their perspectives, and their ability to play; a place where families are valued for their bonds and traditions, their commitment to work, home, and community, and their dreams for their children; a place where staff are valued for their vision, their delight in children, their skill, heart, and knowledge, a commitment to families, and an ability to play. We cherish what we learn from each other.

Rye Country Day is built on four acres of meadow land. This spacious building houses several classrooms which are both self contained and fully integrated, providing for an expansive and creative curriculum.

Our emphasis is on the development of the whole child through socialization with his/her peer group. It is our belief that the abilities to read, write, and process numbers will be a natural consequence of an interest and excitement about projects which have meaning to their daily lives. We will explore the world around us through field trips (in Kindergarten) and nature walks (all classes). We will learn to observe simple processes around us such as measuring through pouring of liquids, addition and subtraction through block building, writing through describing pictures, vocabulary development through meaningful conversations and reading through storytelling and thoughtful discussion. 

We believe that skills are more easily obtained in a friendly atmosphere where there is respect of the child and encouragement of his attempts to learn and praise for his or her achievements. Research has shown that a child with well-developed social skills will have greater growth in his/her intellectual development. We recognize that all conversations with children about meaningful aspects of their lives will encourage brain growth and increased cognitive development. We will provide opportunities for interaction, active rather than passive activities and opportunities for each child’s self-interest.

One of our immediate goals will be to encourage children to interact with unfamiliar adults, socialize with other children and adjust to the routine of school. We want every child to become “an independent thinker” who will be able to solve problems independently, be self-confident, respectful of their peers and adults and who will embrace learning. Our teachers are committed to working with parents to provide children with the strong base necessary on which to build their education. While we work very hard to educate each child, we recognize that we cannot do this alone. We need your assistance to help your child grow socially, emotionally and cognitively. As a team, nothing is impossible!

Our long term goals will be to strengthen the children’s cooperativeness, curiosity, resourcefulness, absorption in worthwhile explorations and activities. We will encourage the development of responsibility for one’s behavior and one’s actions. Above all, we want children to be happy in their play so that their learning becomes a joy.";"https://playmateslc.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Playmates-Learning-Center/143468379027483";"Mon:

At Acorn, as much time and emphasis is placed on your child's social, emotional, and physical development as on his/her intellectual development. The curriculum and warm, friendly environment stimulate and challenge all aspects of your child as s/he becomes involved in learning. The whole child is considered and planned for in our everyday interactions. When your child is comfortable, self-confident, and developmentally ready, s/he is able to perform and succeed to his/her potential.

Acorn School encourages children to experiment, participate, and have fun. Whether it is enjoying our outdoors through gross motor play, or indoors through block and Lego building, finger painting, drawing, cutting, creative writing, acting out a favorite story, counting by fives, or learning sign language, the emphasis is always on the process rather than the product.

Through creatively enjoying movement, art, music, and theater, children embrace a curriculum emphasizing the sciences, world cultures, and creative arts. We also recognize that play is a vital part of your child's development, and therefore value it as important part of each day.

We intentionally keep the teacher-to-child ratio very low — an average of one teacher for every five or six students — to ensure your child gets as much individual attention as possible.

It is committed to providing a safe, fun-filled space with activities which excite, encourage, educate and engage children in grades K through 6 living in the Hopkinton School District and attending both Harold Martin School and Maple Street School.

.In September of 1983, TSNH began under the supervision of Shaker Road School in Concord.  We opened our doors at the Hopkinton Community Center with an enrollment of six children and a staff of one.  In January of 1984, the Program was incorporated as the second after-school program in the State of New Hampshire.  TSNH founders, Rose Pound and Linda Ottery, envisioned an economical, quality child-care program that would help parents avoid leaving children at home alone.

Each child is treated with dignity and respect in an effort to bring out his/her very best.  All staff members are charged with maintaining a safe and healthy environment for children.  Each exhibits a community spirit that makes every child feel valued and included.

The Program is licensed to serve 50 children a day.  The average daily attendance is 40.  TSNH maintains a staff-to-child ratio of 1:8, double the state-mandated requirement.

They wanted to ensure that children, particularly the children of struggling single mothers, were being well cared for.

Today that program, Mary Johnson Children's Center, is a leader in early childhood education both in the county and in the state. The Center is home to several programs which support children and families. Reflecting the goals of its founders, the Center strives to meet the needs of working families who use the Center and who represent the economic and cultural diversity of our community.";"www.mjccvt.org";;;"http://www.mjccvt.org/employment/";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our goal at Leaps and Bounds Child Development Center is to provide a fun, stable and creative environment that will foster and promote the development of positive and individualized self-esteem. Our creative and nurturing approach will provide your child with the physical, social, emotional and intellectual support to ensure their readiness for school.

Children need a safe, secure and creative environment that allows them to explore and learn. Leaps & Bounds centers’ are purposely-designed environments to inspire exploration and play; while guided by trained childcare professionals. Classrooms outfitted with age specific learning tools are combined with gross motor space, inside and outdoors allowing children to exercise their bodies as they develop their minds.

We work as partners with parents to create an atmosphere where the development of young children is supported and celebrated. We encourage parents toparticipate and collaborate in all aspects of their child’s experience with us. Positive collaboration means open, respectful communication between our staff and families. We welcome parents to visit the center at any time.

Examples of these theme may include: “Welcome to School”, “Getting to Know You”, “Fall Foliage”, “Fire Safety”, “Halloween”, etc….

To learn more about our program please contact us.

Stepping Stones focuses on the development of the whole child.  We look to nurture the cognitive, physical, emotional, social and creative life of the child, believing every child is unique, competent and developing at his or her own pace.  Through observation and documentation teachers research and reflect upon the children's play and topics of interest with all members of the community:  creating challenges, provoking curiosity, encouraging problem-solving, and delighting in discoveries made through child, teacher and parent engagements. For the inside scoop on how this works Clay Play , In The Kitchen, and Permission to Talk share stories of our everyday experiences and practices.

We believe that children learn best through hands on experiences and play.  We encourage children to be life-long meaning-makers, to develop self-control and to be self-directed by offering opportunities to contribute, initiate, investigate, and follow through on interests within a dynamic community context.  Children are encouraged to make choices and learn to develop healthy relationships with their peers and community.

We believe that children thrive when parents and teachers establish strong relationships through respectful communication and collaboration.  Daily conversation about home and school events, journal exchanges, community meetings, and participation in emergent curriculum/project development, are some of the ways we enjoy our partnership.  Like John Dewey, we believe that ""education should be child centered; [it] must be both active and interactive; and [it] must involve the social world of the child and the community.""  We believe it is in this kind of setting that children have the greatest opportunity to thrive.  As teachers, we welcome parent's values and their vision for their children as a way of educating our school and practices.

We believe that when children are holistically respected, teachers are present, attending, and participating in each child's life with responsible kind-hearted intention.  We believe that it is important for children to have plenty of open time to construct their understanding about the world both independently and interdependently.

The Reggio approach fundamentally believes that young children are capable and confident learners who are able to build meaningful relationships with their peers, adults, their community and the natural world around them.  

In a Reggio inspired center like the BFC one will see high levels of dramatic play, exploratory play, and self-guided, teacher supported curriculum. To encourage this, our teachers support children’s learning initiatives by offering choices and guidance central to the ideas that the children have developed with their peers.  

The children use few if any pre-fabricated mass produced games or toys employing instead open-ended learning materials such as blocks, clothing, recycled materials and real world tools. The BFC is also committed to serving children and families who have limited financial resources and special needs. We partner with local agencies to provide services for all children based on their individual needs and the needs of their families.

We strive to nurture a child’s curiosity, ignite their enthusiasm for exploring, and help them develop tools for inquiry, invention and achievement.  In that quest, we welcome families and others into a community-wide collaboration to help our children become their best selves—responsible citizens and stewards of the greater world, and builders of the future.”

What distinguishes an elementary school and makes it unique?  Here at the Village School of North Bennington, we strive every day to answer that question.

Creating a school that is warm and caring and helps our students to be “interested in life” is our first objective.  But beyond that, we want everyone who walks through our doors—teachers, parents, staff, volunteers—to feel the sense of excitement and enthusiasm that has blossomed here at VSNB since its rebirth as an independent town academy, in 2013.

 It’s a part of our philosophy that children who feel safe, secure, and nurtured will be successful learners. Toward that goal, rather than simply providing an atmosphere of education, VSNB creates an environment for education based on the mission above.

Central to our curriculum is the integration of biblical principles into the total learning experience. This is our basis for developing Christian character. Our conviction is to guide children to their capacity for poised leadership, serving their fellow man consistent with the call to love God with all their heart, soul, mind and strength, and their neighbors as themselves.

The Green Mountain Montessori's mission is to provide a stimulating, caring and healthy environment that guides children to reach their fullest potential – becoming responsible, independent and creative individuals who are aware and proud of whom they are. 

We follow the Montessori philosophy in order to provide an environment that fosters the child’s natural love of learning. Our mission echoes the words of Dr. Maria Montessori – ""Our aim is not only to make the child understand, and still less to force him to memorize, but so to touch his imagination as to enthuse him to his innermost core"". Our state's wonderful natural resources will play a prominent role in enriching this environment, fueling the child's natural desire for exploration and building respect for his/her world.

We are explicitly committed to building a diverse community that models the world we live in today – one of diverse racial, cultural and economic backgrounds. Our staff, families and neighbors will work together to build this community through a partnership that is dedicated to the development of our precious children.

Children between the ages of 3 and 6 are just beginning to explore two new concepts, ""I am apart from everyone else"" and ""I am a part of the whole world."" As each child approaches these concepts differently, so too do Quarry Hill teachers approach every child.

Our program is flexibly structured to offer as much challenge as each child may need from age three through kindergarten. Exploring different materials encourages learning across a wide range of traditional academic and creative pursuits. Outside, we have a wonderful play area, outdoor learning equipment and gardens. We encourage each child's inventiveness and personal expression, while also helping her or him to develop body control and the ability to plan out, carry through and complete personal expressions. We hope each child will achieve harmony in a vigorous body.

Our school day encourages both individual and group activities. All our furniture and materials are child-sized and placed within easy reach so that children can initiate their own projects and activities, and feel ownership of their environment. With one teacher for every seven children, our close community takes equal responsibility for sharing and caring for our materials, our plants and animals, our school building and play yard. 

 Quarry Hill School is a non-profit corporation. Our Board of Directors includes current parents, teachers and community members. Our monthly newsletter, monthly parent meetings and whole school gatherings for holidays, special days and workdays help keep our community happily involved and informed. We also meet for family conferences in the fall and spring. Parents can visit throughout the day to contribute to our curriculum or to simply join in the fun.

Come by and visit! The teachers and children at Quarry Hill School welcome visitors. Just let us know in advance so we can plan to include you in our day.

In FY 1995, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to three years of age in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children’s growth and development.

The apostle Paul said, ""in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"" (Col. 2:3).

From this foundational truth spring several distinctive features of our educational philosophy. The goal of a Christian education is to guide children into a lifelong relationship of knowledge, service, and love for God through spiritual, intellectual, physical, and social training. Using God's Word, the Bible, as our preeminent textbook, we expose children to every facet of human knowledge and experience through this authoritative filter. Each discipline is examined through the framework of our Christian beliefs and values.

The Word of God clearly states that parents are responsible for the education of their children. Christian parents who desire to fulfill their Biblical responsibility of bringing up their children ""in the nurture and admonition of the Lord"" (Eph. 6:4) may do so at MVCS. The school views its role as an extension of, and not a replacement for, the home.

Parents wishing to enroll their child(ren) at MVCS must affirm that at least one of the student’s parents is a born-again, Bible-believing Christian. The parents must be in full agreement with the doctrinal and philosophical positions of the school (found on the back of the application form). The family must regularly attend a Bible believing church.

Each student is privileged to learn under a born-again, Bible-believing, Christian teacher who attempts to model Christ-like behavior. As students grow and develop, each of these ""models"" of Christ enables them to understand the way in which the Christian life is to be lived. Whether through activity, lecture, or discovery, students learn in a context that is thoroughly Christian.

Finally, the Word of God instructs us to ""do all in the name of the Lord Jesus"" (Col. 3:17) and to ""do it heartily"" (Col. 3:23). Therefore, our goal is to provide academic excellence in every facet of the program. Whether it is Reading, Literature, Science, or Math, we strive for the very best instructional strategies, materials, and curriculum. This emphasis on quality extends to all areas of academic life.

Preschool is a licensed, multiage early childhood education program, committed to providing a nurturing, enriched environment for children to explore and grow.  We are open year-round, Monday-Friday from 8am-5p.m. for children ages 2-7.  We are centrally located in a beautiful farmhouse with expansive views, open fields, and a 500 acre wooded preserve across the road.  We also offer vacation/summer camps and after-school art classes for ages 7-13, Music Together classes for families, instrumental lessons, an in-ground swimming pool offering swim lessons, and adult classes.  Our facility also houses Art Tiles Studio, organic gardens, barnyard animals and the residences of friends and family.

Our preschool curriculum is designed to inspire learning across developmental levels and learning styles by offering a wide range of learning opportunities through both thematic studies and free play. The children’s social, artistic, intellectual, physical, and emotional development is nurtured through opportunities to explore art, music, dance, drama, math, natural science, literature, cooking, gardening, animal husbandry, and cooperative games, without the use of T.V. or computers.  Although we ask that each child is present for circle and meal times, participation in activities is optional, as we believe that children learn in many ways.  We teach respect through loving kindness and do not tolerate violent or hurtful behaviors, even in play.  We encourage alternatives that help everyone feel safe and involve children in problem solving, rather than punishment.

Throughout the year, we cycle various curricular themes, such as, insects, water, seasons, solar system, etc.  Themes provide a focus for our explorations and help to inspire a love of learning.  Many themes are chosen through observing the children’s interests during free play.  We often invite guest speakers from the community and participate in field trips.  Parents are always invited to share traditions, experiences, and talents with us. We encourage you to further your child’s understanding by connecting this learning to experiences at home";"http://www.alltogethernowvt.org/content/alltogethernow-preschool";;"Monday-Friday from 8am-pm";;"http://www.alltogethernowvt.org/sites/www.alltogethernowvt.org/files/atn-registration-form.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.alltogethernowvt.org/sites/www.alltogethernowvt.org/files/logo_0.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Without your help, we would not be able to sustain this program, which is now in its thirteenth year of providing after school enrichment for the children in our community.

We are anticipating that our funding will remain quite similar to previous years, with approximately 40% of our total budget coming from the 21st Century Grant award. The other 60% needs to be raised through program fees, donations, grants, and contributions from the School and Town.

This year the Eagle Connection renewed its license as a child care facility through the State of Vermont. This allows us to receive subsidy funds for the children and families who need assistance, food reimbursement for the daily snacks children receive, and access to State grants. During the school year, our program operates Monday through Thursday from 2:30 pm until 5:00 pm. During the summer, the Eagle Connection runs a six-week “camp”, Monday through Friday from 7:30am to 5:30pm where children receive breakfast, snack and lunch during the day, as well as time to work on academics, enrichment activities, and multiple weekly field trips within Lamoille County and beyond.

Each session of our program offers a wide variety of enrichment classes such as cooking, video game design, the tricks to magic, sewing, sports, games, crafts, robotics, science is awesome, young artists, zumba, yoga, and even an ECS yearbook club. Our most highly attended program is Johnson State College Fun Day, where over thirty students travel to the college after school to tour the campus and participate in activities such as swimming, rock climbing, tennis, basketball, and group games in their large gymnasium.

During the summer, it is our main objective to offer a program that engages children in fun and exciting activities. However, we also aim to keep the children’s minds sharp by using academic workbooks and lessons that review what a child should have learned in the previous school year, as well as a preview of what will be expected of them in the upcoming year. This past summer, our students went on a field trip at least twice a week, once to Lake Eden to swim and fish, and the other to locations such as hiking Elmore Mountain, attending the Lamoille County Field Days, the Jay Peak Pump House Water Park, bowling, the Lowell Wind Farm, and Northern Lights Rock & Ice, to name a few.

Our budget is extremely limited. We have had to increase the number of staff members to accommodate for a sharp rise in student attendance, however, our budget is still set up to provide for the reduced amount of students that used to attend the program, thus creating areas of deficit.  A lack of funding will ultimately impact the children in our community the most, and will make it unlikely to sustain the momentum we have gained over the past year. Part of the support we need comes in the form of a request to the town to give our program $4,000 so that it can continue to offer high quality programs for all the elementary school children in Eden. Without this necessary support from the town, the Eagle Connection will have a very difficult time running an after school program with the quality that we currently have.  Thank you very much for your time and consideration.";"http://www.edenvt.org/?page_id=411";;"Monday through Friday from 7:30am to 5:30pm ";;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 Essex Hollow Playschool, Inc. provides a developmental preschool program, in addition to quality childcare. Many of our activities are done in a multi-age setting, although group time is set aside each morning when the children are divided into groups by age. Our goal is to provide a program that will fit each child's needs, as differing as they are from one another, rather than having the child fit the program.

 Children construct their own knowledge by acting upon the world around them - it is not just a matter of reproducing what is presented to them. Through learning centers, the children have an ample amount of time to do just this. Our centers provide open-ended activities, allowing the children to use and practice basic motor skills, experiment at their own pace, and question what is happening. They will be able to look at all the possibilities whether they work or not. After all, mistakes are a valuable part of the learning process. We want to provide the children with an enriched environment, which will give them the opportunity to make choices, challenge, and provide them with the feeling that they are capable, competent, and responsible young individuals.";"http://www.essexhollowplayschool.com/home.html";;"Monday – Friday: 7 AM – 5 PM";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our primary function is to serve 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students from Bellows Free Academy, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, and other interested students from the surrounding areas. NWTC also offers courses and programs to adult students–high school student graduates, as well as non-graduates–who are interested in continuing their technical education. 

There are eleven programs to choose from at NWTC.  Each program is offered in a two or three year sequence, meeting one to three periods per day, five days a week. The second year is a continuation of the first year, but offers advanced work and some specialization. The third year of a program is an optional year for students. They can choose to do an independent study, complete a third year of the classroom program, or work toward an on-the-job placement in their chosen field. Students enrolled in NWTC programs may receive equivalent credit in Math, Science and/or art. Some programs have agreements with area colleges that grant transcripted college credit (dual enrollment). All programs stress development of good work habits and desirable on-the-job behavior.";"http://nwtc.fcsuvt.org/";;;"http://nwtc.fcsuvt.org/jobs/";;"http://nwtc.fcsuvt.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2014/08/Student-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://nwtc.fcsuvt.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/10/copy-header4web-e1384883701393.jpg";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

    We believe that children have a diversity of talents; we customize/personalize curriculum to support their achievements.
    We believe that each child who comes to us is an individual who brings both their strengths and their weaknesses with them. We honor each child’s unique differences and accommodate their social, emotional, and academic needs to the best of our abilities.
    We believe children are able to learn through observation, experimentation and exploration. By offering our children a safe place to explore and reflect; we feel they will develop a stronger understanding of academic principles and be able to make personal connections to the curriculum.
    We believe that children benefit from not only playing with their peers but also through group discussion, formal lessons and activities. We structure our day so children get the benefits of all aspects of our learning environment.
    We believe that when children are allowed to explore the natural world they can create a deeper understanding and appreciation for the world around them. children will spend time outside of the school challenging themselves physically, mentally and emotionally.
    We believe that education should create the circumstances for which our students to show their true selves. We create the conditions under which each student will flourish as individuals that will complement the whole of their community.

Piché and by 2013 had grown to encompass three Heartworks Preschools, in Burlington, Williston and Shelburne along with the Renaissance Elementary School at Shelburne Farms. 

In September 2013, Lisa and Paul Zengilowski assumed ownership of the schools. They have a rich and varied history with the school, initially as parents, whose children Gregory and Allison attended Heartworks and Renaissance Schools through sixth grade. Lisa designed and inaugurated several programs at Renaissance including;  

    Renaissance Summer Enrichment Academy 
    Renaissance Full Moon Family Campfire 
    Renaissance Annual Yearbook

In 2002, Lisa joined the organization as the first School Director for Heartworks Williston and held that position from 2002-2012; she was instrumental in growing the school from four classes to nine classes including expanding to Kindergarten through Second grade classes during 2003-2007.

We strive to nurture a child’s curiosity, ignite their enthusiasm for exploring, and help them develop tools for inquiry, invention and achievement.  In that quest, we welcome families and others into a community-wide collaboration to help our children become their best selves—responsible citizens and stewards of the greater world, and builders of the future.”

What distinguishes an elementary school and makes it unique?  Here at the Village School of North Bennington, we strive every day to answer that question.

Creating a school that is warm and caring and helps our students to be “interested in life” is our first objective.  But beyond that, we want everyone who walks through our doors—teachers, parents, staff, volunteers—to feel the sense of excitement and enthusiasm that has blossomed here at VSNB since its rebirth as an independent town academy, in 2013.

 It’s a part of our philosophy that children who feel safe, secure, and nurtured will be successful learners. Toward that goal, rather than simply providing an atmosphere of education, VSNB creates an environment for education based on the mission above.

Our average class size is 16 children per class.  The core areas of curriculum include the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for English Language Arts (writing, reading, speaking and listening), math, science, and social studies.  In addition, all children enjoy enhanced learning opportunities through weekly specials instruction in the areas of art, music, physical education, and technology.  We also have a full service library with brand new shelving that houses over 12,000 books for children.  

Derby Elementary is a technology rich environment, with interactive boards and document cameras in every classroom, three mobile laptop carts, 2 computer labs, 24 Kindles, access to an online library for downloadable books,25 Playaway audio books and a 15,000 volume leveled book room for classroom instruction.  In addition, all fourth - sixth graders are assigned their own Chromebook to use in the classroom.  Our teachers are integrating technology into instruction more and more every day in an effort in increase engagement and prepare children for the world of work in the 21st Century and beyond. 

I feel honored to have the privilege of being part of such an amazing school.  Derby Elementary is a beautiful school, but the real treasures are found within its doors…..children that are eager to learn.  The high-caliber teachers and support staff continually seek out opportunities to engage learners in new and exciting ways.  Together, they build a kind, tolerant, accepting learning community that focuses on success for all children.  High standards, mixed with fun, memorable experiences are a recipe for success at Derby.

First and foremost, our staff believes that each and every child is a unique individual capable of learning and success! We provide an inclusive setting that recognizes and caters to children's varied abilities, needs, and learning styles. We believe that to create such an inclusive setting, we must provide the children with balance.

In addition, our staff believes that young children thrive and learn best in an environment that is nurturing, stimulating, and provides a variety of developmentally appropriate experiences and materials intended for the “whole child”. We believe that children learn best through meaningful play and exploration, and encourage a balance of child-centered activities with teacher-instructed curriculum. Our programs integrates curriculum that encourages social, physical, emotional, and creative growth. We believe in positive language, active problem solving, appropriate and defined limits, and positive consequences for desired behaviors.

As teachers it is our duty to serve as positive role models and facilitators, to create empathetic and caring classrooms, and to stay updated with our trainings and certifications to ensure best practice. We believe in the power of love, understanding, acceptance, exploration, autonomy, and balance. ";"www.annettespreschool.com";"https://www.facebook.com/AnnettesPreschool";"Mon:

Very soon after opening, we discovered that not only were the majority of our clients local families, but also that they wanted scheduled care without the traditional year-long contracts expected at other centers.

We also were approached about formalizing a program for 2 year old children; in essence combining daycare and preschool (set preschool program with the option to add childcare time before or after the structured curriculum). Using a theme based curriculum from years past, we jumped right in and by the spring of 2011 had completed our first year of an “Introduction to Preschool” program. Throughout the year we had tweaked and changed elements of the curriculum to be more age appropriate for our 2 year olds and worked on preparing a plan for the next year.

Our 2011/2012 school year included a lot of growth and many additions to our preschool curriculum. We also spent quite a bit of time reevaluating what we wanted to be and how we wanted to define TAKE FIVE. From those discussions it became clear we really enjoyed the preschool program and wanted to expand it. However, we still wanted to be able to offer flexible care to people.

We develop curriculum in response to students' interests.  We offer students a range of ""real"" materials--water, soil, rocks, plants, snow.  Balch children learn by doing; they play in the mud, climb on logs, follow insects, and plant seeds.

By guiding young children to connect with the natural world in our nurturing, hands-on, discovery-oriented program, we seek to inspire a lifelong love of nature, and foster a lasting environmental ethic.

SES will continue to foster the ideals of a community-centered school through a continuous collaborative effort with groups and individuals in the community. Working together to build a strong foundation will help promote a positive perception of school for our students and will also promote a safe and respectful learning environment.
  
We believe that all staff and students should take responsibility for their actions and for the integrity of their work.  The school will advocate for the needs of these individuals, through the academic and social standards in place to help provide additional support to ensure all student needs are being addressed. We as a school can meet our goal of having students achieve academic success and develop good citizenship by providing rigorous and engaging learning opportunities that foster curiosity, creativity and exploration. It is our hope that students will develop a strong desire to learn because of these ideals. We will positively reinforce this desire and promote the best education possible for our students by continuing to develop the schools education programs, through constant revision and evaluation of our curriculum. 

I would like to encourage parents to be involved in your child’s education. You can do this by joining the PTO, have your student participate in an after school program or by visiting the classroom to work directly with teachers to provide an extension of the school day at your home.

This routine is flexible to the needs of the children, staff, special events, and any weather opportunities. During the course of the day, your child will experience group and one-on-one activities, outdoor play, music, art, and early language and reading activities. The child care center is open for families to visit at any time, and in fact, we encourage parent participation. Holidays and Birthdays will be celebrated, if you feel you would like to do something special for any holiday or your child’s birthday the staff will be happy to help you carry it out. Developmentally appropriate toys and activities will be available throughout the day for free play. Each week a new curriculum plan is posted so that you know what your child is experiencing at Little Tot's Academy as well as a schedule for each age group based on their individual needs. Group activities, extra activities, special events, and field trips are planned monthly, with parent involvement in mind. Our goal is to provide the quality care that families look for, and deserve.

They wanted to ensure that children, particularly the children of struggling single mothers, were being well cared for.

Today that program, Mary Johnson Children's Center, is a leader in early childhood education both in the county and in the state. The Center is home to several programs which support children and families. Reflecting the goals of its founders, the Center strives to meet the needs of working families who use the Center and who represent the economic and cultural diversity of our community.";"http://www.mjccvt.org/";;;"http://www.mjccvt.org/employment/";"http://www.mjccvt.org/applications/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
