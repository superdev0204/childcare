Our curriculum is designed to encourage curiosity, to provide opportunities to think creatively, to allow your child to make choices and decisions for himself, and to be able to act freely upon those decisions within appropriate limits. Above all, your child will be in an environment where he or she is respected, encouraged to grow and learn, and most importantly, loved. MISSION STATEMENT To provide developmentally appropriate programs and experiences that enhance each child’s social, emotional, physical and cognitive growth; and to create an atmosphere of warmth and understanding where children can develop as individuals and as part of a group. To this end, teachers are encouraged to design experiences to broaden and deepen children’s use of the ideas they are developing naturally and are expected to be positive role models within this philosophy and to provide experiences that will initiate the child’s thinking and aid each child in developing respect for others, a sense of responsibility, self-discipline, and independent learning.";September 17, 2007;https://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/MychildCare/FacilityProfile?FacilityId=1956;38.9618679;-77.0839234;NW;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The goal is to assist children and families in overcoming obstacles to long-term stability and autonomy through support, education and connection to resources in their community. Kidspace is a program of House of Ruth, which focuses on providing services to women and children in crisis. The mission of House of Ruth is to provide a safe haven which helps participants find healing from traumatic experiences, overcome barriers to stability and independence, and become interdependent, contributing members of their community. CUSTOMER SERVICE PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICE AT KIDSPACE The House of Ruth approach is to provide a respectful, caring, positive atmosphere for child and family development at Kidspace. The work we do is dependent on how we build our relationships with our children and parents. Every interaction with a child or parent needs to be an expression of our desire to meet individuals needs, to recognize the strengths of individual clients and to work collaboratively to reach agreed upon goals. Mutual respect, a listening ear, a willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiation and a consistent approach to problem-solving are hallmarks of customer responsiveness and caring. It is how we approach our clients, as much as what we say, that will make the difference in being effective ultimately. KIDSPACE PHILOSOPHY AND PRINCIPLES OF EARLY LEARNING To meet the needs of an at risk population of young children, the Kidspace early learning philosophy is based on several principles: - Young children learn best by engaging all their senses, including taste, touch, seeing, hearing, and smelling. - Young children need to be actively involved in their learning; learning happens through play, discovery and exploration of the environment. - The child is the initiator of learning; the teacher is a facilitator of learning. - The young child learns best in an emotionally nurturing and creatively stimulating environment. - The child learns through healthy, encouraging and caring relationships with adults who are sensitive to the child's needs and strengths. - The child needs teachers who can vary the program for individual needs and set appropriate individualized objectives. - A child learns best from his/her strengths, rather than focusing on deficit remediation. - Children learn best in inclusive settings where differences are welcomed, accommodated and valued. - Children who have experienced trauma in their lives especially have a primary need to get their emotional needs met and to learn healthy ways to express anger, pain, sadness and hurt without hurting others. - Teachers of children with special emotional needs, provide an environment which is structured, yet with freedom to choose; loving and nurturing, yet with clear boundaries and guidelines and predictable consequences for out-of-bounds behavior. - Young children learn through constant communication, both verbal and non-verbal, with the adults and other children in their environment. All times of the day are opportunities for communication and learning. - Children who are at risk especially need to learn about safe ways of living, including ways to be safe on the playground, in their neighborhood, in the classroom and how to be safe from abuse and other dangers in their environment. - Children who are at risk especially need to learn good health practices, such as hand washing, tooth brushing and toileting routines, good nutritional habits, exercise and other ways to take care of their bodies. Routines throughout the day focus on these important learning opportunities for young children. - An attractive, clean, cheerful and orderly environment helps children, parents and all of us feel better about ourselves and our work. It also aids in the children's (and our) ability to be organized and productive in the environment.";September 19, 2018;https://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/MychildCare/FacilityProfile?FacilityId=2685;38.8465215;-76.974778;SE;1;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, exposure will enhance their ability to be and perform as special, unique and creative individuals. We provide social, emotional, cultural, academic, moral and recreational opportunities for development. These activities stimulate the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. Our program operates as a childcare facility. We offer a threefold program: childcare, educational program and before and after school program with a summer enrichment component. In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Right Act of 1964, it is the policy of the C.H.I.L.D. Center to admit and to treat all children without regard to race, color, religious and/or family background or national origin. The same requirements apply to all persons or organizations having occasion either to refer or recommend the C.H.I.L.D. Center. These persons or organizations are asked to do so without regard to race, color, religious and/or family background or national origin. There is no distinction in eligibility for or in the manner of offering any child services provided by or through the C.H.I.L.D. Center. The C.H.I.L.D. Center is an equal opportunity employer and upholds an open door policy for children, parents, and employees. The C.H.I.L.D. Center is committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). It is the company policy not to discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant with regard to any perceived disability so long as the employee can perform the essential functions of the job. Consistent with the policy of nondiscrimination, the company will provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified individual with a disability, as defined by the ADA, who has made the company aware of his or her disability, provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue hardship on the company. Our Mission and Educational Goal At the C.H.I.L.D. Center, we understand that children reach effective maturity when their talents and abilities have been carefully nurtured and developed. Thus, our mission is to: • Develop the participants’ skills through active learning. • Encourage creativity and freedom. • Provide quality and caring child care in a friendly, positive and developmental environment. • Develop the awareness in the participants that education prepares them for a world of change and responsibility. • Provide developmentally appropriate child care to children of all ethnic, religious, family and racial backgrounds. • Provide rich early learning that channels energy into learning situations which parallel with everyday life. • Encourage independence with a sense of responsibility of self-care. • Provide an educational experience that sets individual goals, is inclusive of all learning styles and abilities, and reaches school readiness goals as outlined in the learning standards. • Provide a learning environment that is inclusive of behavioral and learning abilities. The program will utilize a variety of resources to provide the appropriate educational experience/placement. • Encourage family engagement through student reports/evaluations, parent meetings, program activities, and parent/staff conferences. Our Educational Goal is to provide an educational experience that will allow each child to perform as a unique and creative individual. As the staff at the C.H.I.L.D. Center assist each child throughout his or her educational journey, the staff will impress upon the students that learning is fun, builds upon other experiences and it applies to every day living.;February 14, 2000;https://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/MychildCare/FacilityProfile?FacilityId=1866;38.9563512;-77.0034423;NE;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was built so children would be able to live with their parents while their parents where seeking ways to find the tools with their various additions. Parents are also gaining hands on knowledge with becoming better care givers. Children are provided a safe atmosphere which would give them endless opportunities to explore , learn and communicate with their peers and caregivers. The activities they participate in are geared towards their interest. When children participate in activities that they are interested in, they tend to own it.

C. Because children, as we know them, are inquisitive, creative, and receptive, our staff strives to nurture and encourage these qualities so that our children are better prepared to meet pre-kindergarten and elementary school demands in language, mathematical skills, cognition, and social skills. It is also our endeavor that they are prepared in the areas of interpersonal relationships and behavioral self-regulation through the establishment of guidelines, rules, and routines. We further want to maintain a safe, nurturing, and diverse learning environment that recognizes individual needs of children honed within the context of their family and culture. We have an open-door policy for parents and grandparents in order to build a meaningful relationship and valuable partnership with them. We promote an open communication system that supports a strong partnership with our parents and teachers in the care and training of the children, while helping children become healthy, thoughtful, spiritual, responsible, and respectful people as they grow into adulthood through an early education program that supports their emotional, social, spiritual, physical, and cognitive development.;June 10, 2010;https://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/MychildCare/FacilityProfile?FacilityId=2288;38.8941878;-76.9971709;NE;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
