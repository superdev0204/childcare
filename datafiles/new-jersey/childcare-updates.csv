The Catholic Youth Organization (CYO of Mercer County) is a public benefit community organization that enhances the lives of Greater Mercer County youth and their families, by providing affordable, quality, educational and recreational services. Rooted in the Catholic Tradition, the CYO provides these services in an inclusive and non-discriminatory manner respecting the culture and faith of all.

Founded in 1961, more than 100,000 young people have walked through the Broad Street doors of the CYO Center in Trenton or played at the CYO Camp on Yardville-Allentown Road in Hamilton. Currently served by 25 full-time staff persons (including an Executive Director and 3 Program Directors, certified Pre-School Teachers, as well as over 125 Camp, Teen Program, and After School Counselors), the CYO is presently undergoing program expansions, building renovations and tremendous overall growth. A very active eleven member Board of Trustees is committed to a CYO willing and able to reach out and serve the youth of Trenton and Mercer County.

As an agency of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton (The Most Reverend David M. O’Connell, Bishop and President of the CYO), the CYO understands its mission to be one of love and concern for young people of every culture and faith.";http://www.cyomercer.org/contact_usTCS.html;;;http://www.cyomercer.org/2011docs/CYO%20employment%20application.pdf;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.cyomercer.org/img/logo.gif;http://www.cyomercer.org/2012docs/martinhouse/IMG_0028.jpg;http://www.cyomercer.org/2012docs/martinhouse/IMG_0037.jpg;http://www.cyomercer.org/2011docs/yardafterschool1.jpg;http://www.cyomercer.org/2011docs/chris1.jpg;;

An outstanding teacher needs to be open minded, understanding, and nurturing. Every student learns at a different pace that needs to be taken into consideration. Making accommodations specifically to the needs of each child is necessary to ensure that the children are learning at each subject that is implemented. Despite the differences among children, they are all capable of learning. Proper lesson plans, and varied methodologies, make children learn at different paces which are more attainable for each child.

Every child learns at a different pace and in a variety of ways.

Precious Butterflies does not expect every child to understand a lesson when it is first presented. That is why there are re-teachings and other methodologies that make learning fun and different for the students to retain all of the information in a different way. Precious Butterflies has staff able to work one on one with your child to help and guide them through the daily activities. Children are able to learn through play during centers. This allows all of the students to work at their own pace.

Precious Butterflies believes that being flexible and organized at the same time is critical for success. Lesson plans or the daily routines may not always go according to plan. Flexibility allows the staff and children to have fun and enjoy the activities planned. Children come to school to learn and have fun. It is important for the children to feel comfortable and at ease when in the classroom. The children are able to come to the teacher with any problems or concerns without feeling scared. Nurturing the children to make them feel safe is very important. Precious Butterflies immerses children in a variety of different content areas in order to begin building their well-rounded, educated characters.

In order to develop a well rounded individual, Ready, Set, Learn! includes music and movement, gym, and foreign language learning.

Every classroom is a well structured environment in which children feel a sense of community and belonging. Daily morning meeting activities led by the teachers help us to not only create a classroom community, but to also engage children with their peers and the learning that is taking place.

Children’s learning is encouraged through their own exploration. Children gain a deeper understanding of topics and develop higher order thinking skills when given the opportunity to explore independently. Our goal is to foster a strong collaboration between school and home to ensure your child’s future success.

We are a diverse, multicultural school, whose population of over 540 students, in kindergarten through grade five, are literate in over 25 different languages and hale from a multitude of nations. Community defines the school experience as students interact with the curriculum to become analytical, compassionate, creative and innovative individuals. While students discover and explore their interests, parents play and integral role in the home-school relationship which ensures a supportive school environment.

An integrated curriculum provides researched based programs to accelerate student achievement, close the achievement gap and provide remediation, when necessary. The K-5 instructional program encompasses Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, Health, Physical Education, Science, World Languages, Technology, Guidance, Character Education, Art, Instrumental and Vocal Music. Academic programs include the integration of technology and a variety of instructional strategies which stress literacy development and foster problem solving skills. The use of a spiral curriculum reinforces and expands upon concepts previously presented to motivate students through differentiated instruction while specialized instruction is provided to address learning differences and academic challenges as students develop the strategies necessary to excel academically.

Students engage in a multitude of projects which connects the school to the global community. Food drives, support for the troops, Student Council, Safety Patrol and holiday donations are but a few. These activities provide students a venue to appreciate the talents and contributions of others while learning profound lessons about themselves and how they wish to conduct themselves in the world.

The parent’s organization makes Lafayette Estates a unique building through maintaining its vibrancy and providing opportunities for students to explore a wealth of educational excursions such as the Museum of National History, Newark Museum, Liberty Science Center and Jenkinson’s Aquarium. Class Parents volunteer throughout the school year and are responsible for developing enthusiasm and a natural excitement for school and learning.

Whether you are a student or parent Lafayette Estates continually strives to build academic success for all while embracing individuality, encouraging innovation and building relationships.";http://www.woodbridge.k12.nj.us/lafayetteestates;;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.woodbridge.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01913008/Centricity/Template/8/logos/lafayetteestates.png;http://www.woodbridge.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01913008/Centricity/ModuleInstance/324/large/school%2025%201.jpg?rnd=0.180081675844305;http://www.woodbridge.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01913008/Centricity/ModuleInstance/324/large/Principals%20challenge%202.JPG?rnd=0.676932653727444;http://www.woodbridge.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01913008/Centricity/ModuleInstance/324/large/principals%20challenge%203.JPG?rnd=0.721495399121891;http://www.woodbridge.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01913008/Centricity/ModuleInstance/324/large/school%2025%204.jpg?rnd=0.987086676520802;;

The program emphasizes the development of the individual child as he/she operates in a group. The teachers strive to provide a stimulating environment in which appropriate materials and situations provide rich experiences of learning as well as child guidance as the child is self-motivated to learn.

Our program is designed to maintain and encourage children’s natural curiosity and the joy of discovery, and to help them to express themselves creatively. Our daily schedule is a balance of independent and group activities, active and quiet times, including a snack time and a rest time for full day students.

Of equal importance is the role of the preschool in helping children to accept themselves as individuals within a group. Learning to work, play and share with others in a world of their own, develops independent and self-reliant children. Responsive teachers in an understanding and accepting atmosphere aid the children in achieving emotional control, sensitivity to others and a sense of fair play.

Trinity Learning Center prides itself on providing a clean, safe and welcoming environment, while still promoting the strong academic foundation that our parents are looking for. Classes are offered 12 months a year for infants through 5th graders. Private Full & Half day Kindergarten, Before & After Care and an extensive Summer Program provide a fun and challenging experience for our older students. Developmentally Stimulating Preschool and Pre-Kindergarten Classes are offered for 3 through 5 year-old students. Our youngest students ages 2 months through 3 years are provided with nurturing staff and an exploratory environment to promote self-learning.

    To give the child time to grow.
    To help the child develop a strong sense of self – to allow him to “blossom from within.”
    To provide an environment rich in equipment and materials, where experiences are direct and concrete, to build the foundation for later, more abstract experiences.
    To provide movement experiences for development of physical and motor skills.
    To promote growth in visual, auditory, and tactual perception … to sharpen the senses.
    To provide an opportunity to learn and practice patterning of all kinds… visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.
    To provide listening activities.
    To provide many and varied opportunities for oral expression.
    To build a foundation for sophisticated math concepts through manipulation of concrete materials.
    To build a foundation for chemistry, physics and biology, through discovery and play with blocks, and natural materials such as water and sand.
    To help the child relate to others socially and to be a part of a group.
    To help the child develop problem-solving techniques.
    To promote creative expression through art, dance, music, cooking, story telling.
    To help the child develop the habit of success.

Learning is a way of life.  For every child it is as natural as the need to eat and sleep. Here at Palisades, we continue to provide your child with a stimulating atmosphere in which the learning equipment that they are born with may be allowed to flourish in an environment offering realistic goals and appropriate challenges.

Our schools, with admiration and respect, have incorporated some of the best ideas from the world renowned “Bank Street School” in New York City, and at present, incorporating many of the learning techniques used in the “Reggio Emilia” classrooms originated in Reggio Emilia, Italy. Our main goal is to provide meaningful, integrated, and humanistic approaches to learning and education. We feel that we have accomplished this successfully.

Young children learn through play and by actually using all of their senses to explore and discover. Natural learners, they are curious about the world around them. Activities that encourage gross and fine motor skills are part of our children’s daily experiences. We encourage children to vocalize their feelings, to use words to express themselves whenever possible, and to promote play and respect for one another.

We offer each of our children a safe, secure, and developmentally appropriate environment that stimulates creativity and fosters intellectual growth. New scientific research indicates the intellectual life of a child cannot be separated from the other areas of development.

Mrs. Graney has a Kindergarten-8th grade certification and 30 years teaching experience. Mrs. Traficante has a Pre-Kindergarten – 8th grade certification and 20 years teaching experience. Having been classroom teachers we feel it is important to fully prepare our pre-school children for Kindergarten and First Grade. This is why our program has a balance of academic preparation, social skills and emotional growth. It is our goal for every child to leave our center with all skills necessary to move to the next grade level. More importantly we strive to instill a love of school, high self esteem and the confidence to believe in themselves. ;http://www.kathydunncenter.com/;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kathy-Dunn-Cultural-Center/227959780665255?fref=ts;"7AM-6-PM

As parents, we’ve learned that the best school for our children is one where teachers and staff come to know each of them—their talents and needs, their strengths and weaknesses— as well as we do. This school has small class sizes, and is led by experienced teachers in classrooms about the size of our family’s play room.

As parents and teachers, we’ve seen that each of our children has a natural curiosity about the world around them, an appetite to understand and participate in that world, and the need to be nurtured as they master the skills they need to be successful and happy.  We’ve seen that our children best master these skills with the help of teachers who truly enjoy the time they spend with them and have the experience to guide them each step along the way.

As professional educators, we know that we best nurture the self-discovery and self-confidence of each of our students when we tailor our lessons to address the ever-changing social, emotional, physical and intellectual levels of each one of them. Our experience tells us that we need to be constantly aware of what each of them is capable of today so that we can successfully guide them to build on this to master the skills they’ll need tomorrow.

These are our experiences as parents and teachers that led us to choose Little Ivy for our children. We are thrilled that you have decided to join us.";http://www.mylittleivy.com/;https://www.facebook.com/mylittleivy;"7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

    Each child is unique & has infinite potential. We must create an environment that respects the needs of every child & offers an atmosphere that makes a child feel safe, secure, loved & encourages learning.
    It is now widely accepted that the entire foundation of what we learn & how we learn it is determined before the age of six. Therefore 'good beginnings never end' & as such it is our responsibility to ensure that we offer a program that is constantly challenging & yet allows a child to be a child, so that they enjoy learning.
    Quality child care is only possible when parents & teachers work together to address the individual needs of every child & yet create an environment that offers every child the many benefits, of a group experience.
    Childhood should be a journey, not a race.
    We must show every child respect.
    Cooperation & understanding between parents & staff is essential for our success. Your comments, suggestions, questions and concerns are always important & welcome. We maintain an open door policy which means that you may visit whenever you wish and, of course, you are welcome to call us as & when you like. Staff will share with you many anecdotes and much information about your child’s day. Similarly, parents are requested to share any circumstances about the child’s home life which may affect his/her day.

For those times, Holy Name Medical Center's Sniffles Club offers an alternative that can put parents at ease. The Sniffles Club is a day care program for mildly-ill children, ages 3 months to 13 years old.

It is ideal for children who may not feel up to attending school or their regular day care, but aren't seriously ill and for parents who are unable to take off from work or locate a babysitter.

The Sniffles Club is staffed by licensed pediatric nurses from the Medical Center's Pediatric Unit. Parents are immediately notified if a child's condition worsens. Depending on how they feel, children can participate in various activities. The staff will evaluate the child's need for sleep and rest and his or her schedule will be adjusted accordingly. They can also administer medications with parental consent. Children are served meals and snacks. Special diet considerations can be also accommodated, such as kosher menu, vegetarian meals, and baby food.

Our family-centered philosophy encourages parents to call or visit their child while at work. The Sniffles Club is for mildly ill children only. Children with known contagious diseases such as chicken pox, pink-eye, or measles cannot be admitted.

One area of development should not be accelerated or skipped. One period of development does not become more important than another, as each has its own tasks to accomplish.
 
     Our curriculum is designed to fill a child's day with fun and laughter in an environment of activity, learning, and nurture.     While curriculum and schedules are structured, the daily approach is creative and flexible to best suit the needs of each age group.
 
    Daily schedules provide a balance of activities that include key outdoor/indoor experiences; quiet/active play; individual/group activities; gross/fine motor development; child/staff initiated interactions; structured/free choice activities.

Since then, we have offered unsurpassed childcare for our infants, tiny tots, toddlers, pre-schoolers, after school groups, kindergarten and school aged children. We have always offered flexible scheduling for each child so that the needs of our families can be accomodated. kids art

Our goal is to help each child grow educationally, socially, emotionally and physically in a safe, enjoyable environment marked by caring and warmth. Each day is a special day: something new or some way that is new! Activities are planned for maximum challenge to the mind and to the body. There's time and room to explore, to experiment, to discover and to play. Time to be a child!

The program that we pursue is geared towards helping each child develop habits of observation, questioning and listening. Your child learns that he or she is free to make choices, as long as he or she stays within the limits of consideration for other people and things. A child does not always have to conform.

We value the individuality of each child in our Center and we help him or her retain his or her unique personality. An open-ended program such as ours prepares the child to utilize his or her intellectual and creative abilities in future learning tasks.

We want you to look into our busy, noisy, creative classrooms and see your child at 'work' and at 'play'. We want you to realize the validty of 'play' and the importance of what your child is learning. You and our teachers together can help your child develop his or her full human potential.";http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/;;Monday-Friday 7 a.m. - 6 p.m. ;;http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/contactus.html;;y;y;y;y;y;y;http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/images/logo.png;http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/images/kids_art.png;http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/locationphotos/DSC_0299.jpg;http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/locationphotos/DSC_0254.jpg;http://fourseasonschildrenscenter.com/locationphotos/DSC_0247.jpg;;

Pennie had five children with her loving husband, Thomas Cuneo.  Pennie had been working as a registered nurse for some time when she decided that her true calling was to provide a loving environment where parents can bring their children while they worked.  And that is exactly what she did.  Through the years she saw many families pass through the classrooms at the center.  She was a prominent member of the community, being very involved with her local parish, and was a generous donor to many non-profit organizations.  She often volunteered at the soup kitchen in Camden and carried that tradition down to her children and grandchildren.  Suddenly in 2001 Pennie sadly passed away. At that time her husband, Tom assumed sole ownership of the center and their four daughters assumed the administrative management.  In her memory TLC University was renamed Pennie's Place.  If you look at our sign you will notice the angel overlooking the center, which symbolizes her loving presence.  We are a family owned and operated center that takes pride in the quality child care we have been providing families for over thirty years.
Many of the staff have been at the center since it has opened, and have seen their own children and now grandchildren pass through the doors.  We are one of the few centers that can say they see the return of families through the generations.

It is our aim to provide a safe, nurturing and healthy environment for children to engage in developmentally appropriate activities while still having fun.

Head Teacher Dorothy Scott not only teaches our children amazing things, she also worked closely with the childcare staff to train them in the latest developments in early childhood education. Using Creative Curriculum, one of the 5 curriculums recommended by the NJ Department of Education, every teacher now writes and implements weekly lesson plans that are designed specifically for their age group. Three in-service days were added to the school calendar and the teaching staff has participated in more than 12 hours of continuing education designed to expand their knowledge of best practices in early childhood education.

The education team also expanded opportunities for volunteers to interact with the children, including teen interns, community groups and youth mission teams from all over the nation.
In another move toward greater professionalism, a system of formal observation and assessment was enacted and was met with rave reviews from our families. One parent in particular shared how she was “amazed” to hear about all the things her child could do, and was looking forward to going home and trying out some new activities with her. For this child, our program helped her mother see her child as the capable and unique individual she is!

A new classroom for 2 year olds was started which allows us to offer smaller age ranges in each classroom to better meet the needs of each individual child. All of the classrooms received a “facelift” with a deep cleaning, new materials, and a new layout designed to ensure children are engaged in play in developmentally appropriate learning centers.

Our philosophy is based on a comprehensive theory of child development, which recognizes the equal importance of cognitive, social, emotional and physical growth of the well being of the young child. Collectively we emphasize an experience rich in Jewish culture, tradition and values.

Children need to successfully separate from home and transfer trust from family to school. Beginning with the first moment of separation and experience in the world outside the home, we attempt to provide a secure child-centered ""second home"" to foster self-confidence and self-esteem.

Our curriculum is based on the concept that young children learn best by active exploration. This is accomplished through music, movement and art. Therefore, curriculum is partly determined by the child's own interests. Teachers initiate activities and assist children to expand their information and interact with peers and adults.

Each child is seen as an individual in order to enhance his/her sense of self worth. Our school provides the child with an opportunity to investigate a wide variety of educational materials to encourage a climate for growth.

The goals of the Pre-School at Temple Emanuel follows.

To provide individual learning experiences appropriate to each child's maturational level.To support the rewarding and difficult task of beginning and sustaining relationships with other children and adults.To encourage independent action and thought while respecting the needs and feelings of others.To encourage feelings of mastery.To encourage learning in order to discover personal meaning.To create an environment rich in Jewish culture and tradition for both the child and the family.To develop pre-writing and pre-reading skills to ensure sPre-School Programs";https://www.templeemanuel.org/jewish-education/pre-school#!preschool_;https://www.facebook.com/TECherryHill;9am-6:15pm;;https://www.templeemanuel.org/about-us/register?view=event&layout=list&controller=event&task=events;;n;n;y;y;n;n;;https://www.templeemanuel.org/images/igallery/resized/1-100/preschool_9216-77-640-480-80-rd-255-255-255.jpg;https://www.templeemanuel.org/images/igallery/resized/1-100/preschool__3-74-640-480-80-rd-255-255-255.jpg;https://www.templeemanuel.org/images/igallery/resized/1-100/preschool_9188-76-640-480-80-rd-255-255-255.jpg;https://www.templeemanuel.org/images/igallery/resized/1-100/preschool_9184-75-640-480-80-rd-255-255-255.jpg;;

And discover how enjoyable learning can be.

It all starts by design. The free-flowing, open concept design of our facilities inspires a nurturing, interactive, and collaborative environment in which your child can thrive. Our schools and classrooms are designed to give children room to grow, room to share and room to be themselves. At La Petite Academy, open spaces and open concepts promote open minds.

In addition, our entire school is designed to ensure that your child’s safety and security remain our top priority. And communication is essential. With regular updates (including many photos) of your child’s experiences, you can feel comfortable that you are sharing this journey – every step of the way.";http://www.lapetite.com/your-local-school/voorhees-nj-7093/;https://www.facebook.com/LaPetiteAcademy;06:30 AM - 06:30 PM;http://www.lapetite.com/about-us/child-care-careers/;http://www.lapetite.com/child-care-centers/enrollment/;;y;y;y;y;n;y;;http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/local-schools/new/infants.png;http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/local-schools/new/twos.png;http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/local-schools/new/pre-k.png;http://d2aagyowz0r37a.cloudfront.net/pages/lpa/programs/local-schools/new/private-k.png;;

We have designed our program to provide a maximum of positive experiences, time to explore, and a variety of equipment to stimulate experimentation and, consequently, growth. This growth involves the whole child-emotionally, mentally, physically, socially, and intellectually.

By law, two or more municipalities, but not parts of municipalities, could combine to form one school district. Franklin and Westville, still part of Caldwell Township, had to resolve the problem or be deprived of the school that they had supported. Township representatives held several meetings to discuss the issue of having Franklin and Westville withdraw from the rest of Caldwell Township. The Bill of Incorporation passed the House in Trenton with no opposition. West Caldwell became a borough February 24, 1904.
 
On March 30, 1904, a special school meeting was held to vote on the consolidation of Caldwell and West Caldwell into one school district. The vote was in favor of consolidation.
 
The expansion of the school system was limited during its first 50 years with additions to the Central School building in 1892 and 1902. In 1904, the building was modernized with the installation of indoor plumbing facilities in the basement. Six years later, a new Caldwell High School was erected on Prospect Street between Central School and the cemetery. Tuition students from Hanover, Roseland, Livingston, Essex Fells, Verona, North Caldwell and Fairfield (Caldwell Township) all attended the school. Real estate development in the Borough of Caldwell led to the construction of Lincoln School which opened in 1915.
 
In 1948, an all-purpose room was added to the schools. By September 1985, the elementary schools were feeling the pinch of population growth, and to accommodate the changes in student population, the sixth grade was moved to the junior high, creating Grover Cleveland Middle School.
 
Today, the Caldwell-West Caldwell School District enrolls more than 2,650 students across seven school buildings -- James Caldwell High School, Grover Cleveland Middle School, Jefferson Elementary School, Lincoln Elementary School, Washington Elementary School, Wilson Elementary School, and Harrison School, now home for the school administration, pre-school, pre-school disabilities, and LLD-Harrison classes, and Special Education office.
 
Staffed by 230 teachers, 15 administrators, and 210 support staff, including secretaries, custodial/maintenance staff and part-time aides. Each year, more than 90% of our graduates attend schools of higher education and student achievement is well-above state averages.
 
In December 2007, the residents voted in favor of a new bond referendum to renovate and improve all of the district's school buildings. These renovations and upgrades included a new parking lot, and a resurfacing of the school's back lot and kindergarten playground area for Lincoln School.
 
Now, affectionately known as the ""little school on the hill"", Lincoln School continues to provide its students and families with a wonderful elementary school experience.";http://www.cwcboe.org/Domain/312;;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.cwcboe.org/cms/lib04/nj01001185/centricity/template/5/logos/lincoln.png;;;;;;

Our teachers, experienced professional educators who know and care about children, are guided in the use of these resources by their desire to meet your child’s particular interests and learning needs.

Our classrooms offer a unique, responsive environment that helps children develop confidence in themselves and in their abilities. Each child creates her/his own learning experiences from carefully chosen materials displayed on shelves arranged into interest centers. There are areas for mathematics, language, reading-readiness, role-play, manipulative, sensory-tactile materials, practical life skills, creative arts, social studies, block play, science, physical education, books and music.

As your child learns to make choices, s/he will develop critical thinking skills, become self-motivated, confident and independent.

We welcome families of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds. We offer classes for three, four and five year-old children. Our program provides a nurturing environment that promotes the social, emotional, cognitive and physical development of young children.

At St. Peter’s we believe in learning through discovery. Our focus is on the child as an individual, growing, experiencing, developing, learning about him/herself and the world around him/her. Our goal is to provide an enriched environment in which this natural curiosity is enhanced and nourished, an environment that encourages a child to think, question, reason, predict, and experiment.

Our playground offers a very large fenced-in area which includes several playsets and lots of space to climb. There are sunny and shady areas, a large playhouse, a huge sandbox and a large tire for climbing and class gatherings.

St. Peter’s Nursery School has consistently been awarded accreditation by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. N.A. E.Y.C. recognizes early childhood programs which meet national standards of quality. The Nursery School is licensed by the State of New Jersey. Each class is taught by two teaches who are certified in early childhood education. Additionally, every teacher has been trained in First Aid and CPR. Director Betty McGovern has served St. Peter’s Nursery School for twenty years.

We offer stimulating and varied activities designed to help each child grow physically, emotionally, intellectually, and socially at his or her own pace. 

Using a humanistic approach, the staff draws from eclectic sources. The program incorporates the concepts of, (among others) Adler, Piaget and Montessori, with a strong emphasis on socialization and independence.  Our fully accredited teachers stimulate learning by inspiring a child's spontaneous curiosity.  Activities flow naturally as ideas are explored through books, puzzles, music, dance, manipulatives, as well as reading readiness, math, and cognitive materials.  Instilling a love of the environment and all living things is also integral to our curriculum.  We search for the first robin, dig for earthworms, catch snowflakes, care for pets, study habitats, and celebrate the change of seasons.

It is our belief that by working together, parents and teachers can provide a stable ground from which each child can grow. Our program revolves around our genuine love for children. The staff respects the unique personality of each child participating in the program. Our focus is on the individual child in a social world.

At Over the Rainbow we recognize the continuing need for wholesome, educational and socially responsible early childhood programs. We believe that learning is a lifelong process and our role, as educators, is to nurture each child's natural curiosity and propensity to learn. By implementing early childhood principles, we strive to lay the foundation for all positive future learning and growth. Our goal is to make your child's first educational experience an adventure that lasts a lifetime.

We work in a group setting, recognizing individual needs and preferences, developing strengths, encouraging self-confidence and enhancing the process of socialization. Through all stages of our program we are guided by our belief that each child has the right to expect the security, nurturing, acceptance and encouragement necessary to blossom into a happy, self-fulfilled individual.

Montessori was Italy’s first female physician. She based her philosophy on her extensive scientific observation of the behavior of young children.  Dr. Montessori’s theory of education is rooted in the idea that children learn best in a social environment that respects and supports their individual personalities and their unique modes of development. It is a sensori-motor approach with an emphasis on self-directed, non-competitive learning.   Montessori believed that children can create themselves through purposeful activity and that they possess unusual cognitive ability and sensitivity for absorbing from their environment.;http://www.parksidemontessori.org/;;9am-3pm;;;;n;n;y;y;n;n;;http://www.parksidemontessori.org/_Media/dscf3668_med.jpeg;http://www.parksidemontessori.org/_Media/dscf4107_med.jpeg;http://www.parksidemontessori.org/_Media/dscf3666_med.jpeg;http://www.parksidemontessori.org/_Media/dscf3867_med.jpeg;;

Shomrei Emunah recognizes the importance of education in the first five years of a child’s life, which when nurtured properly, have the ability to pave the way for a lifetime of achievement and meaningful milestones. Our goal is to support young families on their path, whether you are looking to meet new friends, expose your family to the joys of a Jewish holidays and traditions, or instill your child with confidence in his/her ability to explore, create, and learn.

Students in our program learn by doing, touching, tasting, singing, painting, and exploring their world in natural ways. Play is a child’s first exposure to learning limits, socialization, team-building, imagination, and more! Our classrooms are filled with children playing dress-up, building with blocks, poking and rolling out play dough, mixing ingredients for a recipe, and exploring different art mediums. Teachers facilitate play, eliciting questions from students, encouraging social interaction, and helping students problem solve and think creatively.

660752;Union Congregational Weekday Nursery Sch;176 COOPER AVE;Upper Montclair;NJ;7043;Essex;(973) 744-9069;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/;;At Union Congregational Weekday Nursery School, children interact in a rich, nurturing environment designed to stimulate their curiosity about the world and to encourage learning through exploration and play. Within each individual class, the daily schedule and the classroom environment are arranged to give the children opportunities to express their interests and build confidence in their natural abilities and intelligences. Our curriculum is inspired by the Reggio-Emilia approach and New Jersey state standards for preschool. Our focus is on the value of documentation as a means to communicate and the importance of an authentic, child-centered environment which is rich in creativity, providing a wide variety of interactions with people and materials. We make every attempt to meet each child at his/her level, and to identify special strengths and the need for support. Within each age group are developmentally appropriate opportunities for learning. Our Reggio-inspired curriculum is evident in the physical organization of each classroom, where the classroom is regarded as a third teacher.  An atmosphere of invitation is created by teachers, in which the children can explore and develop ideas. Some children express great interest in areas of Language Arts, and are supported in the desire to write and read. Others are drawn to the blocks, where they experiment with Math and Science concepts. All children have materials available to sustain their interests, and teachers continually provide materials and experiences which scaffold familiar areas. The resulting child-driven activities, guided and supported by teachers during the course of each school day, continue over many days, weeks, even months. The children’s work and interactions create a model for learning where they are encouraged to make decisions, solve problems, make friendships, and develop independence and responsibility. Activities involve arts and crafts, dramatic play, indoor and outdoor play, language, mathematical concepts, music and nature. Our Children’s Garden serves as an outdoor classroom where children are free to observe, inquire, and deeply explore their understanding of the world around them. Experiences are documented in wall panels displayed in the hallways and classrooms, along with photographs, the children’s words, and teacher’s interpretations. This communicates that we believe children are powerful, social beings, in charge of their own learning. We feel privileged to guide and support them on their journey. The strength of our curriculum is evident in the ways that children at Union Cong are able to listen to each other’s ideas and to express their own, to look for details in the natural world, and to express this cognition in many creative ways.;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/;;;;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/index.php/admissions/enrollment-forms;;y;y;y;y;n;n;;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/images/long-images/parachuting-to-nowhere.jpg;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/images/long-images/programs-page.jpg;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/images/long-images/how-to-apply.jpg;http://www.unioncongnursery.org/images/long-images/scholarship.jpg;;

Our program is tailored to meet the developmental needs of young children. Every child learns at a different pace, however, with each age certain tasks must be accomplished that are necessary for development. We provide experiences that enrich and enhance each child’s cognitive physical, creative, social, and emotional development in order to master these age appropriate tasks. Our daily schedule allows every child the opportunity to experience their environment first-hand, learning the skill necessary to solve problems and interact with their peers, establishing the social tools they will use for the rest of their lives. Through solitary play and group activities our children develop a positive self-concept that is reinforced by constant praise and affection. Our staff serves as positive role models supporting the idea that children learn by example. We believe family is important and value parents and primary caregivers as the most important teachers in their child’s life. ;http://gcianj.com/shady-lane-child-development-center/index.html;;;;http://gcianj.com/shady-lane-child-development-center/enrollment-gcia-shady-lane-child-development-center.html;;n;y;y;y;n;n;;http://gcianj.com/shady-lane-child-development-center/photogallery/images/SLCDC%202010%20001_jpg.jpg;http://gcianj.com/shady-lane-child-development-center/photogallery/images/SLCDC%202010%20006_jpg.jpg;http://gcianj.com/shady-lane-child-development-center/photogallery/images/SLCDC%202010%20explorers2_jpg.jpg;http://gcianj.com/shady-lane-child-development-center/photogallery/images/SLCDC%202010%20reed3_jpg.jpg;;

We provide a multicultural menu that is approved by the Department of Agriculture. No outside food is admitted. All the food is prepared by our cooks. Provisions are made for children who are allergic to certain food with a doctor™s note. Menus are posted weekly on the main Bulletin Board.

The center provides a yearly calendar with all the holidays, training days and important dates such as the Moving on Ceremony for the preschoolers, Parents Appreciation Day, Multicultural Festival, Harvest Festival and so on.

Our Center accepts vouchers from the Urban League and DYFS.

The center also provides monthly workshops for parents presented by various agencies to help them with resources and the educational development of their child.

The preschool children go on field trips during the year that gears to the curriculum and lesson planning.

All the children go outside for a walk around the community when the weather is appropriate. It is important to dress your child according to the weather.

The first sessions were held in a brownstone on the corner of Duncan and Bergen Avenues in Jersey City, New Jersey. The program quickly grew beyond the capacity of the facility. An additional center was opened in 1982 at the First Baptist Church on the corner of Kennedy Boulevard and Fairmount Avenue. In the Fall of 2013, the school was moved to a temporary location at 8-10 Clifton Place. Due to the success of the program and a huge demand for high quality education, Play & Learn 2 was opened with an additional three classrooms. Play & Learn School is currently located on Tuers Avenue along with the elementary school, Primary Prep. Over the years, Play & Learn School has continued to provide quality preschool education. Our mission is to provide a loving, caring, and safe environment where young children will encounter age-appropriate learning activities, guidance and support throughout the daily routine. Our goal is to provide a strong foundation from which all future learning will flourish.

As educators, we serve the varied needs of the students entrusted to our care, their families, and each other as a faculty. As Christian/Catholic teachers, our paramount purpose is to establish Christian values and morals to develop the whole child as an individual, fulfilling the Lord’s command, “Go and teach all nations.” Christianity is the touchstone of our life. Major Goals 1. To recognize each child as a unique individual with an awareness of Christ’s presence in each other by integrating Catholic Principles and morals in the child’s every day life. 2. To care for the child’s individual needs as they become evident by developing sound study habits and the ability to think clearly, and to reason objectively. 3.

At its core is the guiding principle that the school environment should be one where the child constructs meaning within a learning environment that focuses on educating the whole child by using developmentally appropriate pedagogy that fosters self-confidence and a genuine love of learning. Through our full-day programs, students are able to progress at their own pace and are afforded the time necessary to allow them to develop the academic and social skills to succeed in first grade and beyond. In addition, the school is dedicated to introducing children to notions of social awareness (it is just not “me” in this world) as well as cultivating an appreciation for their environment and nature, respect for others, skills for conflict resolution through peaceful means and the importance and value of intergenerational relationships.

We celebrated our fourteenth year by strengthening a spirit and purpose for community within our school, supporting a foundation for lifelong learning, and gathering data to assess our school goals and district initiatives. Holland Brook School includes 17 homerooms for grades four and five. Respective grade level wings represent a community within our school. We have special area teachers for art, library media, music, innovation/design, physical education, enrichment, gifted/talented, and instrumental music in fifth grade. World language instruction in Spanish is provided for all students. Our special area teachers work collaboratively with classroom teachers to design and integrate special thematic curriculum activities. Our school-wide enrichment model challenges and enhances all students’ interests, talents and abilities. The Holland Brook School has approximately 50 teaching staff members. Our teachers value professional development and demonstrate this by participating in after-school continuing education courses, writing summer curricula, attending training sessions through the Merck Institute for Science Education, and by participating in faculty study groups. These processes help teachers to deepen their knowledge base, reflect on practices, refine skills, and enhance best practices. We value teacher leadership, and many of our staff facilitate professional development on curriculum days and through Continuing Education Units (CEU) courses, which are held throughout the school year. We strive to work collaboratively to provide meaningful learning opportunities for all students.  We work hard to develop the curriculum and promote school initiatives. Special theme days, curriculum demonstrations, and cultural events are held throughout the year to enrich the curriculum. Teacher leaders work with their grade level teams to address the curriculum by implementing special thematic grade level events such as “Colonial Trades” and “Electricity.” The reading/language arts program at HBS cultivates an appreciation for literature and exposes students to different genres along with developing writing skills. Writing is integrated across the curriculum and enhanced by technology. The Math Expressions and Connected Math programs reflect the National Council of Teacher of Mathematics Standards and use a hands-on approach to motivate and promote mastery of concepts.  Students are expected not only to solve math problems but also to write and talk about their mathematical reasoning. In social studies, students analyze, synthesize, and interpret issues and events related to their community, state, country and world. Through experiential activities, our students learn to relive historical events. Holland Brook School promotes a quality and inclusive approach to the education of all children. Our Special Education programs meet the diverse needs of our classified student population, including in-class support, out-of-class resource opportunities, and full inclusion classes. We strive to differentiate and meet the needs and ability levels of all of our students. To expand meaningful opportunities for our students beyond the school day, HBS offers clubs for art, rocketry, environmental issues, music, newspaper, sports, student leadership, robotics, yearbook, and technology. Through the efforts of our Home School Association, our students benefit from cultural arts programs, teacher mini-grants, field trips, book fairs, and special theme activities. We value and appreciate active parent involvement in our school. HBS staff members believe that an effective school creates a sense of community. We continue to create a community of learners. We strive to make connections to the curriculum and real life experiences, and to utilize resources to enhance and understand students’ learning styles. We are proud of what has been accomplished, and applaud the efforts of our students, staff, and parents in achieving our goals.;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/site/default.aspx?PageID=1;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/hollandbrook;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/nj01000244/centricity/template/2/headers/hollandbrook.png;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01000244/Centricity/Domain/161/homepage_flash/left/IMG_4059.jpg;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01000244/Centricity/Domain/161/homepage_flash/right/IMG_4043.jpg;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01000244/Centricity/Domain/161/homepage_flash/left/IMG_4058.jpg;http://www.readington.k12.nj.us/cms/lib07/NJ01000244/Centricity/Domain/161/homepage_flash/right/IMG_0242.JPG;;

To foster the love of learning and encourage individuality and self expression. We are committed to providing a high quality superior educational experience unparalleled and unsurpassed by any early childhood program provided.

The key to Montessori is that it identifies with the child's natural desire to learn. The drive with which the child holds within him is the bases for all principles and methods to Montessori. With this innate desire to explore and discover by himself the child becomes an independent learner. All this in a safe and happy environment.

Our commitment does not stop there. We believe in a continuity of learning extending it well beyond the classroom and into the home and family. After all, this is were practical life skills taught will be utilized and the sense of accomplishment felt. Educating parents in the techniques and principals used is of most importance to our continuity of learning belief. We strive to meet the needs of the children and their families.

We incorporate all facets of a child's life experiences into our learning programs. Understanding the issues and challenges with which all children are faced with at each age, gives us the knowledge needed to facilitate early learning for any child regardless of background. This ensures that we also address a child's emotional and behavioral development. A completed well rounded age appropriate program takes into consideration each and every developmental pathway of a child's life.

Regular centers may be recognized for promoting the social, cognitive and physical development of children. We not only promote these things but put emphasis on the later the emotional and behavioral development. This approach is an added must to the conventional motor and cognitive developmental programs provided by most conventional day care centers.

Prepare the environment to meet the child’s needs. This should include not only the physical needs but also the psychological. The child’s physical needs include clothing, shelter, food and security plus ample space to move around in. The child’s psychological needs are love, social acceptance and respect for him/her as a human being. Always keeping in mind that each child is unique and will follow their own natural pathway of development. It is up to us as parents and care givers to guide them as they progress in their endeavors.";www.hamiltonmontessorischool.com;;;;http://hamiltonmontessorischool.com/?page_id=13&mm=13;;y;y;y;y;y;y;;http://hamiltonmontessorischool.com/wp-content/gallery/west-windsor-farm-2011/img_4469.jpg;http://hamiltonmontessorischool.com/wp-content/gallery/dr-suess-day-celebration-2012/p10.jpg;http://hamiltonmontessorischool.com/wp-content/gallery/windsor-farm-2012/cimg1278.jpg;http://hamiltonmontessorischool.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/school1-300x192.gif;;

We began as a traditional morning cooperative nursery school, and as family needs have changed, we have added program options to help accommodate working parents. Princeton University supports ULNS by providing space, maintenance services, and substantial scholarship support for children of University employees and staff when needed. Although many ULNS families are University affiliated, the school is open to all.

In the cooperative morning nursery school, the adult-to-child ratio is 1 to 6 or better (1 to 3 in the 2 1/2-year-old class); it is 1 to 7 in the non-cooperative lunch and afternoon programs. Depending upon age, all classes have 18 or fewer students (the 2 1/2-year-old class has 12). The morning cooperative program accommodates all of our 112 children, and the afternoon program can accommodate up to 28 children. We are licensed by the State of New Jersey as a Child Care Center for children over age 2 1/2. ULNS is accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

The University League Nursery School welcomes people of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, priviledges, programs, and activities available at the school. It does not discriminate in administration of its educational, admissions or employment policies, scholarship aid, or other school-administered programs.

The program provides services to special needs children from birth to three years old.

The Step Ahead program aims to maximize every child’s potential. We work with children in a number of key areas, including social/emotional, physical, language, and cognition. By working together with parents, the staff are able to prepare a child so that the crucial first steps on the journey to learning begin on solid ground.

Services include daycare, parent support, transportation, group and individual education as well as therapeutic interventions.

We offer programs according to age and ability from birth to three years. Children are grouped in the following manner:

    Koala Bears - Birth to 15 months, and children with critical physical needs.
    Polar Bears - 15 months to 2 years. These children work at developing independent skills in feeding and playing.
    Zebras - 2 to 3 years. Teachers work with parents to develop fine and gross motor skills as well as language skills that are appropriate for this age group.

Four years ago, our preschool installed a 12' X 12' teaching garden on the school's grounds. Each year from April to November we have enjoyed exploring the teaching garden and have used it to teach so many agricultural concepts.

Our students enjoy each aspect of caring for the garden, more than planting seeds and picking tomatoes. In April, we begin by learning how to prepare the garden for growing. We enjoy pulling weeds from the roots, compare deep and shallow root systems, and learn that some smell like onions! We learn why weeding the garden makes our plants stronger. We learn that some vegetables grow above the ground and some grow below, that plants grow to different heights, and that some produce blossoms which turn into vegetables! Some grow quickly, and for others, we seem to wait forever.

While we are preparing and weeding our garden we enjoy collecting bugs and worms for inspection, identification, and discussion and then release them back into the garden. We have a worm farm in our classroom and we watch the worms dig, since the worm farm has plastic sides so we can see the worms 'underground'. We learn that worms are useful to our garden, aerate the soil, and leave essential nutrients behind for our plants to enjoy.

The children plant seeds and watch them grow in plastic cups so we can examine root systems. Crops include lettuce, spinach, broccoli, strawberries, tomatoes, zucchini, beans, chives, pumpkins, cucumbers, and more have grown in our garden. We journal our experiences, measure, compare/contrast young seedlings, and learn how we can help these plants produce delicious vegetables. We experiment by sprouting bean seeds in water, sand, rocks, and paper towels and learn what environment yields the best seedlings and why. We even have the children help build an irrigation system since we don't have a water source near the garden!

As we pick and taste our crops, we teach that part of growing is trying new tastes/textures. The children learn about the food pyramid and that part of a healthy diet includes foods from many food groups. We talk about our favorites from each group and learn that these foods originate on farms! We enjoy setting up a pretend farm stand in our classroom, 'selling' produce, learning money value, adding, budgeting, and introducing new vegetables to the children. We are fortunate to have a teacher's assistant whose family has been farming in Cranbury since 1926. She is always happy to answer questions about farm life, equipment, crops, and running a farm stand.

Von Thun's field trip offers our children consistent agriculture teaching about nurturing plants and flowers, having a plan for the farm, selling the produce and plants, caring for the animals, nature facts in the barn, and more. We have especially enjoyed the 'burger' and 'pizza' gardens. The children tie in what they have learned in class to real-life farming which deepens their learning. We know this is true because of the relevant questions and comments they share while on the trip and back in class. We value our farming community and are proud to have the opportunity to teach the children agriculture at Cranbury Presbyterian Nursery School.

As evidenced in the essay we learn a lot at CPNS but in the most developmentally appropriate ways for preschoolers.

    At the Y, strengthening community is our cause. We believe that lasting personal and social change can only come about when we all work together to invest in our kids, our health and our neighbors. That’s why we focus our work in three areas:
    Youth Development – Nurturing the potential of every child and teen
    Healthy Living – Improving the nation’s health and well-being
    Social Responsibility – Giving back and providing support to our neighbors

OUR CAUSE
    The Y is a cause-driven organization that is for youth development, for healthy living and for social responsibility. That’s because a strong community can only be achieved when we invest in our kids, our health and our neighbors.
    The Y is community centered. For nearly 160 years, we’ve been listening and responding to our communities.
    The Y brings people together. We connect people of all ages and backgrounds to bridge the gaps in community needs.

    At the Y, strengthening community is our cause. We believe that lasting personal and social change can only come about when we all work together to invest in our kids, our health and our neighbors. That’s why we focus our work in three areas:
    Youth Development – Nurturing the potential of every child and teen
    Healthy Living – Improving the nation’s health and well-being
    Social Responsibility – Giving back and providing support to our neighbors

OUR CAUSE
    The Y is a cause-driven organization that is for youth development, for healthy living and for social responsibility. That’s because a strong community can only be achieved when we invest in our kids, our health and our neighbors.
    The Y is community centered. For nearly 160 years, we’ve been listening and responding to our communities.
    The Y brings people together. We connect people of all ages and backgrounds to bridge the gaps in community needs.

Our school provides a clean and safe environment for your child.  Our experienced teachers provide love and respect for each child, and learning experiences to encourage your child's social, emotional, physical and intellectual development.  We believe that parents are equally responsible for their child's development and offer opportunities for parents to participate in our program.  We believe in an open-door policy, where parents are welcome to visit their childs classroom anytime.

Our school is a home away from home; a place where children feel they belong.  Children play with new friends while experiencing learning activities appropriate for their age level.  Each classroom has a ""circle time"", stories and songs and craft time.  Weather permitting, we have outdoor playtime.  We do not allow bullying, and encourage positive behavior through positive reinforcement.  Our curriculum is based around weekly and monthly themes, which encourages a child's natural desire to learn.  All children need to feel acheivement, have self-respect and good self-esteem.

";"By definition, formal education involves institutionalized teaching and learning in relation to a curriculum through systematic instruction, teaching and training by teachers.

At Greatstart Early Learning, we go beyond this accurate but bland definition of education, as our students thrive in an exciting and stimulating learning environment. We started in 2004 as a modest preschool in the South Plainfield-Edison-Piscataway, New Jersey area and called ourselves Stepping Stones Learning Center. We are the best reviewed preschool in the areas where we have a location and that is mainly attributed to how we take care and nurture not just the children that are entrusted to us, but also their families. It is something we're passionate about and why we've been 100% referred.

To distinguish our own better way of early education, we have adopted our new name to represent the great foundations we teach your children to allow them to grow and develop into well educated and responsible global citizens. The name maybe different, but we are the same bunch of people you've trusted and loved and we will continue to provide the highest care and education. No matter where you enroll your child in our various locations, you are guaranteed the same education and care standards. That is our commitment to you.

We offer classes for 2's, 3's, and 4's, with small class sizes and teacher/student ratios to ensure our students receive truly individualized attention. All ages enjoy music with the director Amy Naphtali as she plays on her guitar or plays musical games. Our very own Miss Judy Wiskin runs our extensive Mommy and Me program, plus runs several family programming events throughout the course of the year. During summer we have a wonderful summer camp, just right for little ones ages 2 to 5. The children are kept happy and engaged for 6 weeks, incorporating indoor time with outdoor play.

The curriculum is diverse and flexible, allowing children to utilize all of their senses while developing foundations for reading, language, math, science, and social studies. Jewish holiday experiences and weekly Shabbat celebrations with the Rabbi instill an appreciation for Judaism. Our KinderPrep program prepares our 4's for their next step into Kindergarten. Our students learn and grow through play and conquer new activities and challenges. They feel secure in a school environment, learn to be responsible, feel loved and love to be in our school.

Temple Beth Ahm Preschool's students are from Matawan-Aberdeen, Marlboro, Hazlet, Manalapan, Middletown, Old Bridge, Sayreville and surrounding areas.

We offer a nurturing and safe environment for children ages 2 ½ years through Kindergarten.  Our programs include half day and full day preschool classes as well as a full day Kindergarten. We believe that children learn best by doing; the more senses involved, the better the learning experience for your child.  When the children’s “hands are on” their “minds are on” too.  We offer differentiated instruction because we realize that not all children learn the same way and in doing this, we are able to build upon each child’s strengths and provide extra support where needed.  We believe in “teachable moments” throughout our day in order to make learning as meaningful as possible.  Our objective is to create a special environment where children come first and have the chance to grow developmentally, socially, physically and emotionally. Our priority is to instill in children a love of learning and that school is fun! The Mountain Hill School is unique.

It was founded in 1988 and has been happily serving the community’s children ever since.  Owned and operated by Sandy Carasia along with a talented staff of teachers and assistants help make Meadow Flower the local nursery school of choice for our parents.

Our teacher turn-over is low, meaning our children are taught and nurtured by friendly and familiar faces…each with an average time on the job exceeding 5 years and some with over 10 years! Add a low teacher-to-student ratio and you’ve got a recipe for learning and growth.

Located in the United Methodist Church of Fair Haven and adjoining the picturesque Fair Haven Fields, Meadow Flower enjoys a warm and inviting setting for learning and growing.

Our programs include half-day sessions for children 2 ½ to 5 years old.

Some of the goals that we have include the following:

    Provide an environment where children can develop positive thinking and self-worth
    to increase competenciesw and skills in communications, physical coordination, self-reliance and dealing with emotions
    To introduce problem solving, critical thinking and exploration of your child's own thoughts and ideas

The school provides young children an opportunity to grow into their fullest potential in a caring and stimulating environment with support and guidance provided to the parents.  Our cooperative Preschool serves children beginning at age two-and-a-half through age four and our Primary School offers a Developmental Pre-Kindergarten program and an extended-day Kindergarten. In addition, we offer special programs aimed at enriching each student’s school experience: Extended Care, Preschool Enrichment, Kindergarten Enrichment, and for their siblings we offer Sibling Care and Toddler Playtime.

At Tower Hill School, our philosophy is developmental; we aim to meet each child’s individual needs.  Small class sizes provide children with hands-on learning activities.  Independence and self-confidence are developed through age-appropriate activities in a warm and nurturing classroom setting.  Our guiding vision is to provide a strong academic foundation in a caring, supportive environment. We strive to make learning an adventure and to cultivate each child’s natural curiosity into lifelong enthusiasm for learning.  And because we believe that family involvement is essential in early education, parents of Tower Hill School students are encouraged to participate actively in every aspect of their child’s schooling, from working in the classroom (co-oping) to serving on committees that enhance the overall vitality of the school.

In 2013, Tower Hill School will be celebrating 50 years of educating Monmouth County’s children! Tower Hill School is a ministry of The First Presbyterian Church at Red Bank and welcomes children of all faiths and races while embracing universal Christian values, including kindness, sharing, good manners, respect for others and respect for self.

For more than four decades, we have provided a unique and enriching program for children ages two through six years old.

We realize that these early years are the most crucial in the life of a child. Their ability to absorb information is at it's peak, and their curiosity is insatiable. During this period, a child's whole intellectual being is established. We have selected the finest materials and wonderfully dedicated teachers who enable the children to satisfy this need. A child's play at Winding Brook School is purposeful, and aimed at learning rather than simply amusement.

Children should be given every opportunity to gain knowledge. We believe it is the responsibility of the adults in their world to provide them with the experiences necessary for this to happen. Winding Brook School is the perfect place to make this happen. With the support of their parents, and without pressure, our little ones are exposed to a whole new world of reading, math, and science. Music, art, and language are integral parts of their day. The children are successful and confident, and proud of their accomplishments. Not only do we want them to feel safe and nurtured when they are in our care, our goal is for them to learn to love school...and be inspired to learn.

While the nurturing of a child's emotional and social development is the most important aspect of early childhood education, we believe we offer much more than that at Winding Brook School. Our mission is to instill a lifelong love of 'knowledge-seeking' in our little ones, and we invite parents to share in this joy of learning with their children.

... is to provide early childhood education through age and developmentally appropriate activities, based on two main concepts: child-centeredness and problem solving. Out teachers are warm, nurturing and knowledgeable of child development, trained, and committed to the education of young children.
 
Our Philosophy...
... recognizing the community's need for infant care, preschool care, kindergarten and school aged child care for working parents, we give priority placement to this population.
... We believe children learn best through play and social interactions. Our main goals are to nurture children and help them learn to get along with their peers. Child-centered means our program is here to meet the real needs of children, allow them the freedom to be children, and put their physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being first.
... We see inappropriate or destructive behavior as a problem to be solved, primarily by the children with the help of a teacher. Problem solving is how we teach children to form positive relationships, resolve conflicts, learn self-discipline, and show respect for others.
... We accomplish these goals through active listening, negotiating, setting limits, making children feel important, and building our learning environment around the children's needs.
... We are always happy to discuss our philosophy, as well as the individual needs of your child with you.

... is to provide early childhood education through age and developmentally appropriate activities, based on two main concepts: child-centeredness and problem solving. Out teachers are warm, nurturing and knowledgeable of child development, trained, and committed to the education of young children.
 
Our Philosophy...
... recognizing the community's need for infant care, preschool care, kindergarten and school aged child care for working parents, we give priority placement to this population.
... We believe children learn best through play and social interactions. Our main goals are to nurture children and help them learn to get along with their peers. Child-centered means our program is here to meet the real needs of children, allow them the freedom to be children, and put their physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being first.
... We see inappropriate or destructive behavior as a problem to be solved, primarily by the children with the help of a teacher. Problem solving is how we teach children to form positive relationships, resolve conflicts, learn self-discipline, and show respect for others.
... We accomplish these goals through active listening, negotiating, setting limits, making children feel important, and building our learning environment around the children's needs.
... We are always happy to discuss our philosophy, as well as the individual needs of your child with you.

In 1959, there were approximately a dozen students and one teacher. Today, the Co-op has grown to serve more than 50 students from Mendham and nearby communities, including Chester, Randolph, Morristown, and Bernardsville. 

Throughout its history, the Co-op's goal has been to provide a comprehensive preschool education in an atmosphere in which a child can develop cognitively, physically, socially and emotionally.  

To achieve this goal: 

    Each child is helped to develop a positive self-image by learning to enjoy himself or herself as well as others through free play and group activities.
    Each child is encouraged to experiment with new materials and take part in creative play and artistic expression.
    Each parent is encouraged to participate in his or her child’s education.  Parents have the unique opportunity to observe their children in school, to know their child’s classmates and participate in the learning process.

Our Philosophy...
... recognizing the community's need for infant care, preschool care, kindergarten and school aged child care for working parents, we give priority placement to this population.
... We believe children learn best through play and social interactions. Our main goals are to nurture children and help them learn to get along with their peers. Child-centered means our program is here to meet the real needs of children, allow them the freedom to be children, and put their physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being first.
... We see inappropriate or destructive behavior as a problem to be solved, primarily by the children with the help of a teacher. Problem solving is how we teach children to form positive relationships, resolve conflicts, learn self-discipline, and show respect for others.
... We accomplish these goals through active listening, negotiating, setting limits, making children feel important, and building our learning environment around the children's needs.
... We are always happy to discuss our philosophy, as well as the individual needs of your child with you.

Our school is designed to provide a particular and unique experience for Jewish preschoolers and kindergarteners.

Class size is restricted not by licensing requirements but by our knowledge of the needs of young children. We know that love of learning and intellectual acuity flourishes in surroundings that are safe, nurturing, stimulating and inviting. The ability to learn follows naturally from the development of social, emotional and physical skills. Every school activity is planned with these goals in mind.

662332;TEDDY & ME DAY CARE;100 HARTER ROAD;MORRISTOWN;NJ;7960;MORRIS;(973)-538-0811;http://www.teddyandme.org/contact-us.html;;"We are a Day Care Center and Nursery School that serves children from two and one-half to six years old. We operate as a form of outreach for the church, meaning that religion is not excluded from our program as in the public school system. Staff and children of all religious beliefs are welcome here, our goal being to support and encourage the diverse ways families worship God. We want children to feel secure in the knowledge that there is a loving God who watches over us all. Teddy & Me recognizes that we are entrusted with a family’s most precious possession, their child. Of first importance to us is to keep the child safe while they are in our care. Second, we strive to make a pleasant environment, as coming to school should be a happy experience, especially for children so young. With this safe and pleasant atmosphere established, we then strive to help the child learn by using appropriate techniques for their stage of development. Teddy & Me Day Care Inc. opened in September of 1985. We employ a certified staff of loving teachers who strive to instill in each child the appreciation of their own uniqueness. The staff makes observations about the children’s development and shares them with the families at two scheduled conferences throughout the year, and less formally on a continual basis. The center is open from 7:00am to 6:00pm. This means that a child could spend the greatest part of their day with us, therefore, our program is of the utmost importance. Each day children are involved in a large number of activities with alternating active and quiet times. We have a developmentally appropriate curriculum that includes the areas of physical, social, emotional, spiritual and academic growth. While the day is carefully planned by the staff, children are able to choose many of their activities, with younger children having a more loosely structured day. Our program offers the best of nursery school with the possibility of an all day format.

We opened with 20 children and expanded to meet the growing need for quality child care in our community.  In 1980, we moved into a new building specifically designed for child care and owned by the Township of Parsippany-Troy Hills.  During the 1990s, we renovated with two additions to the building, which made room for infants and young toddlers.  We are governed by a Board of Trustees, who are volunteers from our community. 

Our facility was designed specifically for the care of children, and was built with HUD funding.   Our center has a total of 7 classrooms, a large multipurpose room, a full service kitchen, offices, adult and children’s lavatories.  We are in the process of updating our playgrounds to be in compliance with public playground standards for 2014. Our center is comprised of a diverse population of families and staff.   We come from a variety of backgrounds and speak multiple languages from all over the globe.

A very unique relationship exists between our center and Township of Parsippany-Troy Hills.  Parsippany built the original building and owns it.  A self-renewing contract allows for joint responsibility for repairs and building upkeep.  Primarily the center maintains the building and the town maintains the property.  We also have strong ties with civic organizations within Parsippany, including but not limited to the Kiwanis, Rotary and the Sons of Italy.  We have fostered relationships with businesses, including Novartis.

We maintain a strong connection to the United Way of Northern New Jersey through a variety of programs.  We are recipients of funds to support training and education through Child Development Associate certification, tuition assistance for families, and in previous years the Commercial Real Estate grant.

 We are licensed to serve 131 children, but based on teacher ratios and best practices, our goal is to operate at 105 children.  We continue to improve our services through self-evaluation, self-reflection, technical assistance, continuing education and best practices.  We maintain connections within the community through activities at the Parsippany High School, Baldwin Oaks Senior Center and other local community based organizations.  We participate in civic events such as Parsippany Day.  We support our families through a number of avenues, family breakfasts and lunches several times a year.";http://pardaycare.webs.com/;;6:30 am to 6:30 pm;http://pardaycare.webs.com/ourstaff.htm;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;;http://pardaycare.webs.com/IMG_2630.JPG;http://www.freewebs.com/pardaycare/IMG_2565.JPG;http://pardaycare.webs.com/IMG_2431.JPG;http://www.freewebs.com/pardaycare/IMG_2442.JPG;;
662362;Peachtree Montessori Learning Center;1279 ROUTE 46;PARSIPPANY;NJ;7054;MORRIS;(973) 299-7322;http://www.peachtreemontessori.com/;info@peachtreemontessori.com;"The philosophy of the Montessori education originated in educational approach and teaching of an Italian educator and physician, Maria Montessori.  She focused on the development of human in all stages of their childhood. She also focused on the important responsibility of childhood when it comes to their formation towards becoming an adult. For Maria Montessori, education serves as an integral part of child’s development.

Philosophy of Montessori educations follows several educational concepts and approaches in order to assure that children who are enrolled in this type of education will be given proper care and attention while studying. To give you an idea to some of the important concepts highlighted in the Montessori educations, here are the lists of some of the concepts that the philosophy of Montessori education and these are as follows.

Ø      It is based in the concept that children are marked differently compared to adults. Maria Montessori advocated some important rights of children and greatly believed that these children will be respected and clearly understood, and it will be an amazing world for them towards becoming better adults.

Ø      Montessori philosophy also downplays the performance evaluations with huge quantity of letters and numbers where children are exposed to.

Ø      Children should be capable to get hold of self directed learning approaches through saying what they learn rather than waiting for their teachers to teach them.

Ø      The teacher who is going to teach Montessori education teachings and methods should always be an observer and facilitator to all the children. They need to facilitate and observe better ways for children to direct their own learning. The growth and development of student and teacher dynamic relationship can assist them in helping themselves and each other to become better person and learn positive values, attitudes, and learning they need for their future.

Ø      Most of the children are susceptible to some sensitive periods which are commonly referred to as their intellectual growth. This period should always be properly used and understood since it provides essential benefits to children when given proper time and attention. If this period will be left ignored, there might be a big loss in the learning outcome of the children.  That is why, Montessori education teachers need to spare time and attention understanding each stages of children’s life in order to get hold of best educational results.

Both the children and the teachers in the Montessori education plays an important role in helping each other to acquire new learning concept, ideas and philosophy that could help them for a better future.  It is very important to know that not all schools are of the same philosophy as what Montessori education does.  The name of Montessori education is really a trademark that is very unique and obliquely different from other types of school.

With the philosophy highlighted in this Montessori education, there are already huge numbers of schools as of today who are sparing time and effort to adopt the same philosophy they are implementing. This is due to the fact that the philosophy of the Montessori education really marks the life of every child in the world that really provides them not only educational learning, but more of experiences that develops their wellbeing as early as their age.";http://www.peachtreemontessori.com/;;;;http://www.peachtreemontessori.com/admissions.html;;n;y;y;y;y;y;http://www.peachtreemontessori.com/images/logo.jpg;;;;;;

To provide early childhood education through age and developmentally appropriate activities based on two main concepts: child-centeredness and problem solving.


Our Philosophy
To recognize the community's need for quality infant care, preschool programs, kindergarten, and school-aged child care for working parents. We give priority placement to this population.

We believe children learn best through play and social interactions. Our main goals are to nurture children and help them learn to get along with their peers. Child-centered means our program is here to meet the real needs of children, allow them the freedom to be children, and put their physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being first.

We see inappropriate or destructive behavior as a problem to be solved, primarily by the children with the help of a teacher. Problem solving is how we teach children to form positive relationships, resolve conflicts, learn self-discipline, and show respect for others.

We accomplish these goals through active listening, negotiating, setting limits, making children feel important, and building our learning environment around the children's needs. We are always happy to discuss our philosophy, as well as the individual needs of your child with you.";http://www.childcaremorriscountynj.com/;;Monday–Friday, 7 a.m.–7 p.m. ;;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;;http://www.childcaremorriscountynj.com/image/55990701.jpeg;http://www.childcaremorriscountynj.com/image/55991088.jpeg;http://www.childcaremorriscountynj.com/image/55991185_scaled_236x172.jpeg;;;

We are a community coming together to see students become responsible, productive, life-long learners.  This year our district is working on specific goals to further the pursuit of academic achievement and success for all students.  First, we want to continue to improve the climate of the school and increase parental communication and involvement in the greater school community.  One way we are doingthis is through our new parent liaison position.  The parent liaison has already improved the climate of our school by being an accessible source of information in English and Spanish.    We are also continuing last year’s parent workshops and adding more opportunities for parents to have hands-on support.  

We started the year off implementing Positive Behavior Supports strategies in our lunchroom, which has already improved the organization, safety and ultimately climate of the All Purpose Room.  We are moving forward to encourage kindness, thoughtfulness and positive behavior within as well as outside the classroom. 

Our second graders helped us to get off on the right foot by participating in an artist residency program on multicultural dance completely funded through a Morris Arts Community Foundation Artist Residency Grant Award.  They learned a lot about cooperation and patience with themselves and others.  The performance, at the end of September, was to a packed house.  The entire school benefitted from starting the school year off enjoying an educational and entertaining performance together. 

Another goal we are working on is improving integrated Language Arts achievement.  The students at Marie V. Duffy are learning about reading through clear instruction on reading strategies and extended practice applying those strategies while reading.  We are focusing on developing students’ reading and writing stamina as well.  Finally, we are using data analysis to inform and enhance instruction to improve student achievement.  Individual teachers, grade-level cohorts, and teams of administrators, teachers and specialists, meet regularly to analyze student achievement data and adjust plans accordingly.  Please join us in our challenge to meet our district goals for the benefit of our students.";http://www.wbps.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=11;;8am-3:05pm;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.wbps.org/cms/lib07/nj01911727/centricity/template/globalassets/images///logos/duffy_logo_web.png;http://www.wbps.org/cms/lib07/NJ01911727/Centricity/Domain/96/Firemen%20are%20Our%20Friends.jpg;;;;;

Your child does NOT need to be potty trained.  We will help potty train your child when YOU feel he/she is ready.  We will follow your lead, or help guide you though the process.

We provide breakfast, two snacks a day, milk and juice.  We have computers in every classroom, including the two’s and three’s classroom. We offer discounts to parents of multiple siblings, EMT workers, police officers, and firemen. 

Parent Involvement: The Learning Tree welcomes as much time as you are able to give to the school.  We feel that the more the home and the school are connected, the more secure your child feels.  We have Back-to-School Night in October, two parent/teacher conferences a year and numerous opportunities for the parents to come into the classroom throughout the year.


At The Learning Tree, we feel that bringing the outside world in is opening up a whole new world for your child and we strive to expose them to as much as is age appropriate.  We have a relationship with the area’s assisted living home, the local fire department, and dentist.  Throughout the year, we will visit the assisted living with songs, crafts, and fun activities.  The Learning Tree feels that these experiences help your child's growth and development.

The primary purpose of the YMCA of Paterson has always been to serve youth and their families.  The roots of the YMCA of Paterson are buried deep in the history of the “Silk City.”  During our nation’s tragic Civil War, several young men gathered in a local congregational church, wrote a constitution and, according to one contemporary source, planned ”an interesting course of social, intellectual, and spiritual exercises.”

From its early beginning in 1863 until 1867, the YMCA of Paterson seemed to alternate between periods of great popularity and community involvement and intervals of inactivity and public appeals for membership.

The first YMCA of Paterson building was located at 20-202 Market Street.  The facility offered a gym, bible classes, a reading room, and an “employment bureau.”

In 1892, the YMCA of Paterson moved into the former Cooke home on Ellison Street.  Mrs. Sarah E. Cooke had donated her elegant mansion to the YMCA of Paterson in memory of her late husband John Cooke of the renowned locomotive firm Danforth & Cooke.   A building containing bath, bowling alleys, a gymnasium, and an assembly hall was erected behind this facility.

Paterson’s historic 1902 fire destroyed the YMCA of Paterson building on Ellison Street, but a new facility was soon erected at 137 Ellison Street.  The new facility boasted dormitories, a swimming pool, track, and a library.  Services included assistance to immigrants and fund-raising for American military forces during World War I.

Our present YMCA headquarters opened on September 14, 1930.  This facility was constructed when the 137 Ellison Street location became too small to accommodate the varied needs of the residence, youth, and physical departments.  The new facility was built at a cost of $1,500,000.  Shortly after moving in, the YMCA of Paterson initiated a relief and job referral service for victims of the Depression.  During World War II, pre-induction physical training was offered to potential military recruits.

The YMCA of Paterson has shifted its course from a predominantly recreational facility to a community center that offers housing to vulnerable populations, as well as social, cultural, and educational services for people of all ages.  The staff of the YMCA of Paterson takes pride in this ability to adapt our programs to meet the current needs of the community.  The staff of the YMCA of Paterson hails predominantly from the Paterson community and reflects the rich diversity of this city.";http://ymcaofpaterson.org/;;"Monday - Friday

The first childcare center, La Vida Child Care Center, was established in 1996 and is located at 396 Straight Street in Paterson. It serves children from birth through age 6. Based on the community’s overwhelmingly positive response to this outstanding program, Straight & Narrow opened La Vida Child Care Center Too in 1999. La Vida Too, located at 116 Jackson Street in Paterson, is an Abbott preschool for three and four-year-old children.

The mission of the two childcare centers is to provide superior early education for children. This is accomplished in a loving and nurturing environment where the children’s physical and emotional needs are continuously monitored by a staff of well-trained and dedicated professionals and para-professionals. The goal of the childcare centers is to equip the children, who almost certainly would not otherwise have such an opportunity, with the fundamental skills needed to begin school, and ultimately, to provide them with the educational and socialization foundation that will carry them through a rewarding and successful educational and life experience.

The childcare programs emphasize school readiness, parent involvement and the achievement of early childhood developmental tasks. These objectives are implemented in a full-day program with a curriculum that includes age-appropriate educational, social and recreational activities. Straight & Narrow’s child care centers are open five days a week from 6:30 AM to 5:30 PM to accommodate those parents who have multiple responsibilities and/or work long hours.

Beginning in the infant room we structure the classroom to promote literacy, creativity, emotionality, and physicality. As your child progresses through our schools, he/she will grow into a child that is comfortable with exploration and loves to learn. The classroom design provides a space for the children to be comfortable and safe. We are able to design our classrooms specifically to meet all children’s needs because we understand that each child has a special way of learning.
Following the Multiple Intelligence Theory, our teachers guide each child in realizing their potential. Each child conceptualizes knowledge in different ways; therefore options are provided so every child can and will succeed.

All of the school staff meet or exceed the state requirements for preschool educators, and have been involved in the area of Early Childhood Education for more than 45 years combined.  Because of their commitment to the education and nurturing of your child, our staff members regularly participate in ongoing continuing education programs. Our teachers have gone through an extensive background screening process to ensure absolute safety for your child.  In addition, they are all CPR and First Aid Certified.

Nurturing the Social: We seek to create a covenantal community of trust and cooperation.

All learn together to respect the cultures and abilities of all participants through multicultural experiences of stories, games, traditions and music.

Nurturing the Developmental: We provide qualified teachers and staff who work diligently to meet each child’s individual developmental needs. Teachers share with children the wonder and beauty of God’s creation. Children are offered a variety of motivating and hands-on experiences which aid in the development of motor, musical, and artistic skills. At appropriate levels teachers lay a foundation for the development of skills in reading, writing, arithmetic, health, social studies and science.

Nurturing the Emotional: We seek to provide a warm, accepting and positive atmosphere. Children are led to recognize their own special characteristics and abilities. Self-esteem, self-control and healthy independence are fostered. Children are also helped to handle and verbalize emotions in appropriate ways while preserving the child’s ability to feel and express the full range of God-given emotions.

Nurturing the Spiritual: We affirm that all children bear the image of God their Creator. As a Christian preschool we seek to be attentive to the spiritual development of children.

I believe this is a very exciting time for your child’s education.  The 1990’s were labeled the “decade of the brain” and the research that was done to understand how the brain processes information has been translated into educational practice.  Stellar Academy takes pride in utilizing this knowledge in our Learning Zones Program.

We know that the preschool years are a vital time in your child’s development.   A lifelong love of learning, a strong self-image, a desire to explore and not fear failure and a connection to others, is only a sampling of the traits that develop in the preschool years.  At Stellar Academy, we understand that everything we do or don’t do affects children.  We also understand that school readiness means preparing your child not only academically, but also socially and emotionally.

How do we do this?  At Stellar Academy we immerse your child in each of the eight intelligences (Musical/Rhythmic, Verbal/Linguistic, Logical/Mathematical, Visual/Spatial, Bodily/Kinesthetic, Naturalist, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal).   Although we do not know the future or what direction our children’s talents will take them, we do know that early childhood is a critical time to awaken your child’s intelligences.  Musical and artistic abilities need to be nurtured as do problem-solving and interpersonal skills.   Your child will delight in our carefully crafted Learning Zones that utilized age-appropriate activities and “play with a purpose” to strengthen and enhance each intelligence.

Unlike other daycare facilities, we realize that one care giver cannot successfully meet the academic and emotional needs of all the children in the room.  At Stellar Academy, we eliminate this problem by ‘defining’ the areas of responsibility for our staff.  Our Zone Teaching Specialists concentrate on creating and administering the best age-appropriate curriculum in their specific zone.  They work hand-in-hand with our Developmental Specialists, who remain with the children as they explore each zone.  Our Developmental Specialists’ main responsibility is the physical and emotional needs of your child.   The Teaching Specialists and Developmental Specialists work under my direct supervision.  Together, we make a dynamic team, able to start your child onto a path of future success and love of learning.";http://www.stellaracademy.com/contactus.html;https://www.facebook.com/StellarAcademy;;http://www.stellaracademy.com/employment.html;http://www.stellaracademy.com/preenroll.html;;y;y;y;y;n;n;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/Logo%20Big%20Clear_small.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img1.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img3.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img6.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img8.jpg;;

The school answers the communities’ calls for a creative, academically outstanding, and affordable alternative to existing private and public schools in Somerset, Hunterdon, and Morris counties.

Our programs integrate traditional subject areas of fine arts, foreign languages, literature, social studies, mathematics, physical education, and the natural world in a cooperative, not competitive, environment. Folktales, rounds, and traditional songs are part of our daily activities. It is academics and art in daily communion.

Children have the opportunity in the morning for uninterrupted free play. They are encouraged to begin their play by simple suggestions from their teachers. They develop their imaginations by building and creating environments, using silks, wool, wooden play structures, handmade dolls, and blocks.

The Cottage School develops a love of learning, free of pressure and sustained by a spirit of discovery at a pace that accompanies the students. The teachers respect and feed the child's innate sense of curiosity, fostering a life-long passion for learning.  Children naturally seek information and our school honors children's natural abilities to ""learn from the whole.” We immerse the students in the subject of study (not just the foreign languages), allowing the children to process large quantities of interrelated information to interpret, solve, and construct conclusions on their own.

    The children are not taught in the scholastic sense we usually attach to the word, but induced by the presentation of suitable material and relevant experiences to discover things for themselves.1

The Cottage School designs its own curriculum and play-based teaching materials, integrating arts, and academics in all the traditional subjects. It uses developmentally appropriate activities to teach without traditional tests, grades, or textbooks. Textbooks can provide facts but are oftentimes shallow, outdated, or one-sided, lacking perspective and varied viewpoints. The teachers create a flexible and dynamic interaction generated by a teacher–student-centered class time.

I believe this is a very exciting time for your child’s education.  The 1990’s were labeled the “decade of the brain” and the research that was done to understand how the brain processes information has been translated into educational practice.  Stellar Academy takes pride in utilizing this knowledge in our Learning Zones Program.

We know that the preschool years are a vital time in your child’s development.   A lifelong love of learning, a strong self-image, a desire to explore and not fear failure and a connection to others, is only a sampling of the traits that develop in the preschool years.  At Stellar Academy, we understand that everything we do or don’t do affects children.  We also understand that school readiness means preparing your child not only academically, but also socially and emotionally.

How do we do this?  At Stellar Academy we immerse your child in each of the eight intelligences (Musical/Rhythmic, Verbal/Linguistic, Logical/Mathematical, Visual/Spatial, Bodily/Kinesthetic, Naturalist, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal).   Although we do not know the future or what direction our children’s talents will take them, we do know that early childhood is a critical time to awaken your child’s intelligences.  Musical and artistic abilities need to be nurtured as do problem-solving and interpersonal skills.   Your child will delight in our carefully crafted Learning Zones that utilized age-appropriate activities and “play with a purpose” to strengthen and enhance each intelligence.

Unlike other daycare facilities, we realize that one care giver cannot successfully meet the academic and emotional needs of all the children in the room.  At Stellar Academy, we eliminate this problem by ‘defining’ the areas of responsibility for our staff.  Our Zone Teaching Specialists concentrate on creating and administering the best age-appropriate curriculum in their specific zone.  They work hand-in-hand with our Developmental Specialists, who remain with the children as they explore each zone.  Our Developmental Specialists’ main responsibility is the physical and emotional needs of your child.   The Teaching Specialists and Developmental Specialists work under my direct supervision.  Together, we make a dynamic team, able to start your child onto a path of future success and love of learning.";http://www.stellaracademy.com/contactus.html;https://www.facebook.com/StellarAcademy;;http://www.stellaracademy.com/employment.html;http://www.stellaracademy.com/preenroll.html;;y;y;y;y;n;n;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/Logo%20Big%20Clear_small.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img1.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img3.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img6.jpg;http://www.stellaracademy.com/images/page3-img8.jpg;;

Established in 1996, our school continues to provide children from Martinsville and the surrounding area with a rich, nurturing and educational environment.

Our approach to education recognizes and addresses each child’s different learning style. We believe all children are born intelligent and that they simply learn at their own pace and in their own way. For this reason, we strive to maintain a learning environment in which each child progresses as he or she masters new concepts and skills.

Our certified Montessori teachers help each student reach his or her full potential by presenting educational exercises and extracurricular activities that promote each child’s physical, social, emotional and cognitive development. Our teachers, however, do not run our classrooms alone. Students are taught to participate in and help manage their community, and through this process, they develop leadership skills.

fWe provide quality educational experiences for preschool and kindergarten age children and are committed to educating students in the Montessori philosophy in our community. We encourage children to be curious, inquisitive, and passionate for knowledge.

Our multi-age classrooms, typically spanning 3 years, recreate a family structure, where our teachers model respect, kindness, and peaceful conflict resolution. We seek to ensure educational quality through small class sizes, low teacher-to-child ratios, and close communication with parents. Our teachers work together with students and their families to make this school experience successful in laying a positive foundation for all future learning.

As the single elementary school in Somerville Borough, Van Derveer School serves almost 800 children.

Meeting the needs of students is the focus of every staff member in our learning community. It is our belief that all students shall have the opportunity to learn and achieve their full potential. Students benefit from school-wide enrichment programs as well as access to state-of-the-art technologies.

The language arts literacy curriculum features a balanced literacy program, which utilizes guided reading and literature circle models. The curriculum is supplemented by a reading specialist. The school houses an abundance of titles, which are accessible to students and staff. Student learning extends beyond the classroom walls through the use of wireless laptop computers, access to the Internet, and a polycom distance learning video system. Virtual field trips enable our students to interact with other pupils, educational programs, and museums throughout the state, the nation, and the world.

A comprehensive school-wide character education program is integrated into the instructional day. By developing a common vocabulary and sharing a common goal, the Van Derveer staff fosters the development of students as individuals. Our students are Caught Using Good Character, serve on the Keep Calm Force, and participate in the cafeteria Control Center where students help others.

The Van Derveer community partners with numerous local corporations, business organizations, professionals, and leaders. While promoting the students' awareness and appreciation for their roles as citizens, these partnerships cultivate and promote the education of our students beyond the curriculum.
Developing a partnership with the families of Van Derveer is a paramount focus. A Parent Resource Center provides information on parenting skills. An active Parent Teacher Organization, an Hispanic Parent Outreach group, and volunteers bridge the home-school connection.";http://www.somervillenjk12.org/Domain/10;;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.somervillenjk12.org/cms/lib5/NJ01001815/Centricity/Template/8/logos/vanderveer.png;http://www.somervillenjk12.org/cms/lib5/NJ01001815/Centricity/Domain/10/Veterans%20Day%20Flag%20Ceremony%202014-2015.jpg;http://www.somervillenjk12.org/cms/lib5/NJ01001815/Centricity/Domain/10/10.08.14.jpg;http://www.somervillenjk12.org/cms/lib5/NJ01001815/Centricity/Domain/10/Governors%20Educators%20of%20the%20Year.jpg;;;

To achieve this, the child will be exposed to various kinds of activities, experiences, and an environment that will allow each child to develop an interest and joy in learning and to work and play with others.

In a Christian atmosphere, we will encourage creativity and self-expression, develop a feeling of security and self-worth, and appreciate the daily presence of Christ in his/her life. While respecting each child's religious traditions, one of the important goals will be to have the child learn about and feel the love of God through Jesus Christ in his/her life.

The Hunter School bases its concept of pre-school education on the importance of the development process during these very special early years.  

The main objective of our program is to encourage and support the development of each unique individual.  We want to help each child realize their full potential for cognitive, emotional and physical growth.

Whether in one of the brand new classrooms on 1122 East Grand Street (Early Childhood Development Center I) or in the blue, red, green, or yellow classroom at 1126 Dickinson Street (Early Childhood Development Center II) your child will benefit from lively, interactive play and age-appropriate school activities that introduce concepts from a Bilingual/Bicultural perspective.  In our preschools, days are filled with curiosity and creativity as children are read to; play make-believe; work on arts and crafts projects; learn the alphabet and other basic concepts; enjoy the on-site playground; and participate in countless games with their peers. The preschools implement the High Scope Setting and the Scholastic Early Childhood Program learning models. The High Scope Setting model allows children to choose which activities they participate in throughout the day. By planning their own day, children are encouraged to ask and answer questions they are interested in, manage obstacles that they encounter, and include classmates and teachers in their activities. The classrooms are set up with different play and learning stations so that children can easily access activity materials and clean them up afterwards. In accordance with the Scholastic Early Childhood Program model, the preschools are set up with activity stations, such as a circle time stations, a story time station, a learning center, and so forth. Because the student to teacher and teacher assistant ratio is 15:2, we are able to understand and meet the educational and developmental needs of each, individual child. Passionate, well-qualified, handpicked teachers encourage social interaction and physical play and provide the emotional support necessary for your child to feel at home.  All teachers have a bachelor’s degree and are certified to teach from preschool to third grade (P-3 certification); teacher assistants have a Child Development Associate (CDA) certificate. There is one teacher and one assistant teacher per classroom, as well as a floating aid and family workers. These and the other staff members work together to provide a full day, full year program. PROCEED is committed to the Abbott promise of providing all families with free, quality education for preschoolers. To facilitate this, PROCEED’s preschool schedule has been specially crafted so that parents of all social and economic backgrounds have a safe, intellectually stimulating, and socially satisfying place to leave their 3-4 year-olds while they are away from home. There are 180 school days, each 10 hours long, with 6 hours of class time and 2 hours of before care and 2 hours of after care available, as necessary. In addition to the regular full day preschool program, both centers offer a summer program for 3-4 year-olds that live in Elizabeth. This program operates from June to August and also provides preschool services for up to 10 hours, Monday-Friday. A healthy breakfast, lunch, and a snack are always provided for both the academic and the summer programs.  We are currently contracted with the Elizabeth Board of Education. Therefore, the only qualification to participate in the preschool program is proof of Elizabeth residency.

The Children's Academy is proud of our Parents Association, which works closely with our teachers to make your child's Academy experience an enlightening and enriching one. The Academy encourages parental involvement and welcomes parent participation and visits. The Academy is always open to family visits.

Since 1981, the Children's Academy has grown from a student body of 35 to its present enrollment of 75 students. The student community includes children from Essex and Union counties. Although The Academy is located in Springfield, families come from Maplewood, South Orange, West Orange, Short Hills, Millburn, Livingston, Newark, Union, Summit, New Providence, Berkeley Heights and Mountainside as well as other areas to form the perfect Montessori Community.

It is not cooperative in the sense that parents help with the actual teaching.  Parents are always welcome to share special talents with us.  We welcome visits from parents during the year.  A monthly newsletter is sent home to inform parents of school projects and news.  This is a source of communication between parent and school regarding the child’s school life.  A Back-to-School Night is held each fall and a Spring Program is presented each May.  Each class has two class mothers.  Class mothers help to coordinate parties and special events for each class.  Class mothers are also invited to accompany the child’s class on school trips.  Any parent who wishes to accompany the class is always welcome.  There is also a Parent Advisory Board that meets several times a year to discuss concerns, to brainstorm for the future and to plan fundraisers.  

Parent conferences are held in the fall and spring, at the school, so that parents may be informed of the child’s progress.  Telephone conferences are also held whenever they are needed.  A checklist of the child’s individual skills is given to the parent at each conference.  If you have concerns about your child, please feel free to call the school at any time to arrange a conference.

Parents frequently ask if the teachers will call to their attention any special needs.  They will be more than happy to do so, if the need arises.  At times, they may ask you to come in for a brief conference.  Communication between home and school is so vital in helping children to success socially and academically.

Teachers must be notified in writing if someone other than the regular carpool or parent will pick up the child at the end of the day.

It is helpful to teachers if parents call the school on days when their child will be absent  (908-277-3686).

We strive to create a rich curriculum that meets the needs of all children: visual, auditory, and perceptual learners. Our philosophy centers itself on the whole child. We aim to nurture and strengthen each child's social, emotional, cognitive, and physical abilities through our program. We believe that children learn through active play and exploration in a multi-sensory environment.

Temple Emanu-El's Early Childhood Education Program strives to provide a variety of services to children and their families that reflect the Temple's Mission Statement and the school's philosophy. These services include:

    To provide a safe and enriching environment for children from 13 months through six years old.
    To foster a positive self-image through a warm, play-centered environment that is healthy, safe, and secure.
    To offer creative play and constructive, developmentally appropriate instruction as part of the daily routine.
    To provide every opportunity for growth and learning for each child. Children learn through interaction with other children and adults.  They also learn through individual exploration, a variety of activities and materials, and consistent nurturing and guidance.
    To encourage the development of a strong, positive Jewish identity and an appreciation for Judaism.
    To develop a reinforcing relationship between teachers and children where teachers strive to understand and accept each child's feelings and thoughts.
    To develop a positive partnership between families and teachers.
    To help families understand the methods and goals of our school experience and work together to enhance the development of their children.

The average class size of 18 combined with thorough in-class support and academic skills improvement programs offers a comprehensive educational system to meet the individual needs of our students.

We employ a balanced literacy approach to reading instruction utilizing various instructional resources including Project Read, Rigby Literacy, and a leveled novel-based curriculum. Project Read and Write Source are the essential components to our writing program using strategies including shared writing, interactive writing and writers’ workshop. Our goal is to develop enthusiastic learners, avid readers, critical thinkers and active writers.

The primary goal of our math curriculum is that students will be able to solve real problems, reason effectively, and make logical connections while aspiring to exceed the standards set forth by the New Jersey Department of Education. The students receive the skills necessary to achieve this goal through the interaction of parents, teachers, peers, and the use of curriculum supporting materials at each level: K-5 SRA/McGraw Hill, Explorations and McDougal-Littel Algebra in grades six through eight.

A cross-curricular, thematic approach in all grade levels ensures that the social studies curriculum builds a bridge between history and daily life as a citizen of Allamuchy Township, New Jersey, the United States and the World. The students are challenged through a diverse series of learning experiences aligned with the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards.

Houghton Mifflin is the base of our science program in grades kindergarten through fifth. Lessons, experiments and activities are designed to nurture and improve the scientific abilities of our students. The science program for grades six through eight offers core proficiencies in life science (sixth grade), earth science (seventh grade) and physical science (eighth grade). Skills of observation, exploration, discovery and investigation are developed and encouraged. Units of study include student projects, vocabulary application of science to daily living and field trips. We also have a fully functioning greenhouse that is utilized for experiments and activities across all grade levels.

We introduce Spanish in kindergarten and continue to develop it through grade eight. Technology is a prime focus both in the delivery of the instruction and in student demonstration of content knowledge. Students in kindergarten through grade six receive a full year course of computers, and most classrooms utilize smart boards and phonic ears. Each student participates in physical education or health four days a week. Students in grades K-8 have art and music each week. K-6 Students participate in computers and media studies as well.";http://www.aes.k12.nj.us/ats/site/default.asp;;;;http://www.aes.k12.nj.us/site/Default.aspx?PageID=174;;n;n;y;y;y;y;;http://www.aes.k12.nj.us//cms/lib04/nj01001493/centricity/domain/1/img_4135.jpg;http://www.aes.k12.nj.us//cms/lib04/nj01001493/centricity/domain/1/science%201.jpg;http://www.aes.k12.nj.us//cms/lib04/nj01001493/centricity/domain/1/img_0626.jpg;http://www.aes.k12.nj.us//cms/lib04/nj01001493/centricity/domain/1/hackettstown%20rotary.jpg;;

    Liberty Learning Center opened its doors in 1973. We are family owned and have been providing children a loving learning environment ever since. We are state licensed for children ages 2-1/2 to 13 years old. This allows us the opportunity to offer families Childcare, Pre-school, Pre-Kindergarten, as well as Before & After School and Summer Programs. 

 Our Center is located just west of Hackettstown with easy access to Route 80. We are one mile east of the Great Meadows Grammar and Middle Schools and are a bus stop for all schools in the district (including Liberty).

Our playground is vast and filled with equipment suitable for the youngest and the oldest child. Throughout the seasons you can find us frolicking under our sprinklers, catching falling leaves, building snowmen, or digging and watering our dirt pile so it blooms into a wonderful and beautiful garden. Our rural 2-1/2 acres provides your child with many opportunities to enjoy nature. 

The front door of Liberty Learning Center is opened by a code. We are very strict about who we let in and will never allow a child to go home with someone other than the parents, unless we have written permission. Inside, our center contains two large classrooms with enough space to accommodate our “littles, middles & bigs”!  Our front room is bordered with buckets of instructional (but fun) toys that hold the interest of students of any age. Our back room has enough space for basketball, art projects, dress up and pretend! 

    From the Math Corner to our Computers, your children will find challenges and rewards every day. If a child wants to relax with a good book, our bean bag chairs will do the trick. Our snack side and LEGO® table go hand in hand to make a comfortable setting. We provide two snacks daily and will prepare your hot lunches in our microwaves. Our refrigerators are available for those sending a cold packed lunch. On Fridays we order pizza and celebrate the end of the week!";http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/;;6:45am–7:00pm;;http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/pdfs/2014Forms/Page2and3EnrollmentForm.pdf;;n;n;y;y;y;y;http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/_borders/Heading1.gif;http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/images/LLCinWinter1.jpg;http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/images/2013/015%20%282%29.JPG;http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/images/2013/006.JPG;http://www.libertylearningcenter.com/images/May04/100_0407.jpg;;

This is an amazing honor that should make everyone in the Slackwood Community very proud.

Playground use after school – The playground is a fun and exciting place for students, especially when there is no teacher monitoring their activity.  We welcome students to use the playground after school hours as long as they are monitored by an adult.  Parents must supervise their children during afterschool hours as we have many afterschool programs also using the playground.  Parents sitting in their cars will be asked to get out of the car to watch their children.  If your child is acting in a dangerous fashion, they will be asked to leave. 

Don’t be late – School begins at 8 AM daily.  Teachers gather their students at 7:55.  Any student who enters the building after 8 AM is late.  If your child comes after 8 AM, you must escort him/her to the office to get a late pass.  It is not good to be late.  Try to be on time for school.  Thank you for your consideration.

This is a representation and reminder that we are here to help our children offer a positive imprint onto the world on their life journey while learning in a free environment.  Our mission at Inclusive Montessori is to implement the philosophy, practice, and curriculum of Dr. Maria Montessori and her method of education. We provide an instructional individualized montessori program, that will enable all students to reach their highest level of academic success.We respect the right and need of each individual child, to stimulate the passion to embrace all of life with respect and love. We develop the skills necessary for active and intelligent exploration and a life long love of learning. Maria Montessori was the first woman to practice medicine in Italy. A scholar of biology, psychiatry, anthropology, and medicine, she graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Rome in 1896. As a physician, Dr. Montessori was in touch with young children and became profoundly interested in their development. Through careful and exhaustive scrutiny, she realized that children construct their own personalities as they interact with their environment. She also observed the manner in which they learned as they spontaneously chose and worked with the auto didactic materials she provided. She studied children of all races and cultures in many countries around the world, soon seeing the universality of the laws of human development. She continued her observations throughout her life, widening and deepening her understanding until her death in 1952. Also a devoted humanitarian, she was three-times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her advocacy efforts toward a more peaceful humanity. Maria Montessori was a scientist, and as a good scientist, she was earth-bound and highly spiritual in her pursuit of truth. Through her studies of educational methods, she declared two principles as the foundation of Montessori pedagogy: the universal characteristics of the human child, and the child as a unique, unrepeatable, respectable, and admirable individual to be unconditionally accepted as one of life's most marvelous expressions.

The preschool was designed to provide quality childcare in a loving and home-like atmosphere. Our commitment to these goals remains strong today and is evidenced in every classroom. Jan is a pillar in the Corvallis child care community and was recently appointed by the Governor to the Commission of Children and Families. The warm, nurturing and educational environment that is a hallmark of Little Beavers is a direct result of Jan’s passion for serving children and her many years of experience working with families.  Our teachers encourage learning at each child’s developmental level.  We implement monthly curriculum themes using stories, music, arts and crafts.  Math and science concepts are introduced through hands on activities using our sensory tables and experiments.  Children have many opportunities to develop imaginative and social skills in our dramatic play areas and manipulative centers.

We take the time to get to know each and every child and their families as a whole. Want to pop in during the day to check on your child? Sure! Want to call for an update on your child’s day? Absolutely! Want to text our supervisor to see if you child ate all their lunch? Go right ahead!

We are all mom’s, grandma’s, aunt’s and big sisters to a child and know how it feels to be away from a loved one for the day. Rest assured, that we will do whatever it takes to make sure both you and your child feel great about spending the day at our preschool.

Our classes are small and taught by instructors who have previous experience in child care as well as continuing education classes. We strive to keep our student teacher ratio low, so that each child can receive the one on one attention they deserve. We believe that your child’s preschool experience should be a happy one. Come in for a tour, meet the new director and see all the great changes we have made.

We look forward to seeing you soon! Check back often for weekly updates.";http://www.abcexpresspreschool.com/;https://www.facebook.com/AbcExpressPreschool/info?tab=page_info;"Mon - Fri:

In 2007, Mary's Little Lambs Academy opened as a home-based child care center in Millville, NJ and as word spread throughout the community of the nurturing care and innovative curriculum at Mary's Little Lambs, the center continued to grow and in 2010 the school moved to 2018 Wheaton Avenue in Millville where we could accommodate more than 40 children - infants through pre-school ages.

Just two years later, with the center at full capacity, Mary's Little Lambs again moved to a larger location that could now accommodate up to 65 children. In September of 2012, Mary's Little Lambs Academy unveiled its brand new facility within the Education Center at The GlassWorks, a multi-tenant business complex located at 1101 Wheaton Avenue in Millville. With its newest location in the same complex as the recently-opened Millville Public Charter School, this allows our children the unique opportunity to transition smoothly from our center to the creative learning environment that the charter school provides its students.

At its newest location, Mary's Little Lambs Academy is able to access one of the area's most unique buildings. The former global headquarters for Wheaton Glass, The GlassWorks complex not only offers a secure environment for our children but a state-of-the-art complex that includes a 256-seat auditorium suitable for our center's special events such as holiday shows, graduation ceremonies and more.

Today, Mary's Little Lambs Academy is proud to service families from across Cumberland County.

With inflation continuing to rise each year and the economy remaining stagnant, the typical American family now requires dual incomes. As a parent, you should not have to worry about the safety and well-being of your child while you work hard to give your family the life they deserve. Mary’s Little Lambs is here to assist you. We understand all the multi-tasking a modern family must undertake on a daily basis and Mary’s Little Lambs’ staff is here for you and your children to try and make life a little easier.

Mary’s Little Lambs maintains the utmost professional staff; we are all CPR and First Aid Certified, hand-selected by Mary herself. Our staff members are all enrolled in school pursuing their college degrees in either the education or medical field. Our staff attends frequent infant and toddler trainings through ITTERS and EIRC while obtaining subsequent certifications. Our parents feel so comfortable leaving their children in a safe environment created by our staff, and the children absolutely love them!";http://www.maryslittlelambsacademy.com/contact.html;;Monday - Friday 7AM - 6PM;;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;http://www.maryslittlelambsacademy.com/MLL_Logo_W_tag.jpg;http://www.maryslittlelambsacademy.com/DSC04131.JPG;http://www.maryslittlelambsacademy.com/DSC03309.JPG;http://www.maryslittlelambsacademy.com/DSC04051.JPG;http://www.maryslittlelambsacademy.com/trent.jpg;;

We are quite unique because at our day care our focus is on developing individual child care plans which stimulate social and cognitive awareness and skills.

We believe children should have fun! After all, even the experts agree that preschool age children learn most through play. These carefree years are so short, and soon the children will be exposed to a much more structured form of learning. During their attendance, many activities take place which help promote and enhance basic skills such as (letter & number recognition, color & shape recognition, large motor skill activities, small motor skill activities, etc).

As part of our teaching we incorporate preschool curriculums into our daily activities to prepare the older children for their transition into school.

We have a strong belief that the partnership and relationship between the parents and our staff are vital to each child's growth. As a result we encourage our parents and staff to work together to make sure that each child gets the most out of our program.";http://www.buddingbabes.com/23.Daycare-Centers-In-Florence-NJ.html;;;;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;;http://www.buddingbabes.com/images/Banner-Photo-1.png;http://www.buddingbabes.com/images/Banner-Photo-3.png;http://www.buddingbabes.com/images/Banner-Photo-2.png;http://www.buddingbabes.com/images/Banner-Photo-4.png;;

Social studies and science themes such as life cycles in the natural world (ie. Plants, insects, animals, water) engage children’s curiosity and create meaningful opportunities to read, write, count, measure, draw, paint, sing, experiment and solve problems.

Our students approach new academic concepts in a variety of playful ways. Math, for instance, is taught experientially through interaction with every day objects, as well as specially designed manipulatives (ie. Unit Blocks, Pattern Blocks, Unifix Cubes, Geoboards, etc…) Math concepts are illustrated in books we read, art projects, songs we sing, games we play and stories we make up.

There are so many ways to make learning fun and interesting. That is what this program strives to do every day. ";http://kinderenrichment.com/;;"Monday - Friday

Wilson Elementary School, home to the Wilson Wildcat League of Champions!  Students at Wilson are surrounded by teachers and staff who are dedicated to providing a safe and orderly environment in which students are motivated to feel responsible for their own academic and person achievements.

At Wilson we educate the whole child.  Educational experiences are designed to challenge and meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of each individual student.  Character education is a key component, with my personal emphasis on “Promoting the Positive”.  Academic, athletic, technological and fine art opportunities abound.

Each student is recognized as a unique and special individual, and is taught to work with, and appreciate, the uniqueness of others.  Wilson students are also made to feel they are integral members of a school family and team.

Through their experiences at Wilson, students prepare for their future.  Our goal is to produce students who will find their place, and become productive citizens in a complex society.

Our goal is success for today! Success for tomorrow! Success for life!

Throughout the year, our teachers and staff will make every effort to keep you informed of your child’s progress.  Encourage your child to use their student agenda book.  Check it daily!  It is a great home-school communication tool!

Do not hesitate to contact me personally with questions or concerns.  If I can be of assistance, call me at 609-631-4169.

I invite you to join us at Wilson, as true partners, working for the best interest of your child.   Research shows that children of parents who are involved in their child’s school community do better in school. 

Remember it takes an entire village to raise a child.  We count on you and your support!  Thank you in advance!";http://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/Wilson.cfm?subpage=34970;;;;;;n;n;n;n;y;y;http://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/logos/277-logo.png;http://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/imageGallery/wwiladmin2060/IMG_9730.jpg;http://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/imageGallery/wwiladmin2060/IMG_9768.jpg;http://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/imageGallery/wwiladmin2060/IMG_9793.jpg;http://www.hamilton.k12.nj.us/imageGallery/wwiladmin2060/DSC01097.jpg;;

The preschool provides services for the child, family and community.  The preschool’s goal is to add to and strengthen (but not replace) the care, guidance and culture provided in the home.

In keeping with this philosophy, the objectives of our program are as follows:

    To provide a physically and emotionally safe and healthy environment for children.
    To provide support and guidance to the total family through daily conversation and parent conferences if necessary.
    To provide a professionally trained staff to help guide the child and family.  To recognize and address needs and problems as they develop.
    To provide a variety of activities to stimulate and advance each child’s physical, intellectual, social and emotional development.  To create an environment that promotes the development of self-confidence and  positive self-esteem.
    To provide the children with good, nutritious meals and snacks while at the center.

In conclusion, our focus is to provide a stimulating early care and education experience which emphasizes the social, emotional, physical, intellectual development of each child. Our objective is to support children's desire to be life-long learners while nurturing their self-confidence and self-esteem.";http://primarycolors.org/;;;;;;n;y;y;y;y;y;;;;;;;

 Kids Choice is owned and operated by two Washington Township mothers who saw a need for a more affordable, caring environment for our children. We set out to develop a company where the parents would be completely at ease with the care provided, and that the children would be excited about coming to school for.

Kids Choice was developed to be flexible for all of our family's needs. This why when you contact us, you will speak with one of the owners, not an automated system or receptionist. We are available to you 7 days a week, not just business hours.

Kids Choice is led by two professionals, Kim Greer and Maria Arizzi. Kim has a sales, marketing, management professional background.

        Our mission includes the provision of unlimited financial aid as well as the integration of special needs children into all of our programs.
        We pledge to continue to identify partnerships with Sussex County businesses, further enhancing this county’s commitment to its youth.

K.E.E.P.’s Board of Directors and staff are extraordinarily committed to achieving what is best for the children in our community. This is demonstrated every day in our programs – but the true measure of our success lies in our community. The support provided by corporations, businesses, and private individuals within our community is remarkable. They assist us in our fundraising efforts as well as pro-grammatically.

Our dream was to create a school that offered a high quality and well-rounded educational program but at affordable rates to young families like ourselves, each having 3 young children. In September 1990 we opened The Giving Nest Preschool & Kindergarten in North Plainfield with 56 students and 10 staff members. Twenty plus years later our ""Nest"" has grown! We now have five  locations in Somerset County - North Plainfield, Watchung, Martinsville, Bridgewater and our newest location in Warren. We believe our success is the result of three things. First as co-founders we have stayed true to our commitment and remain an intricate part of our school; secondly, our dedicated staff and low turnover (a few have been with us since we opened and most have been with us for at least 10 years); and lastly our supportive and wonderful families who believe in what we do. We want to thank you for your interest in our school. We continue to love what we do! Children are a gift ~ they fill our classrooms with laughter, innocence, and a zest for learning. Children keep you young and definitely keep you smiling! We look forward to “showing off” our schools, so call today for a tour of the location nearest you, and most importantly, we hope you will be part of our Giving Nest families.

1104521;Jenn's Junction LLC;530 HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD;NORTH HALEDON;NJ;7508;Passaic;(973) 931-1811;http://www.jennsjunction.com/;info@jennsjunction.com;"Nowadays, sending a child to kindergarten without any preschool experience is like driving a car without any lessons, or jumping into the deep end of a swimming pool without knowing how to swim. There was a time when kindergarten was optional and children attended just to learn how to play with each other and get into the school routine. But today our children are expected to know so much more on the very first day of kindergarten that pre-kindergarten classes are really not optional anymore either. 
Nationwide, over 40 percent of children have some kind of preschool experience before kindergarten. In northern New Jersey, it is rare for a child to not have that head start, ranging from one to three years in preschool. As a result, many young students are entering kindergarten more academically and socially experienced than their parents were.
 Children can attend preschool just three mornings a week and learn what they need to start kindergarten on the right foot this fall. At Jenn’s Junction, for instance, the certified teachers in our Pre-K class use the highly regarded Mother Goose Time curriculum. We also focus on specific knowledge children are expected to have when they enter kindergarten.

Our schools are open year round with full and half day enrollment options.

The curriculum is designed to meet or exceed the standards established by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the nation’s largest early childhood accrediting organization. Programs that meet NAEYC’s standards of excellence provide an environment with a focus on health and safety, have teachers who are well trained, have access to excellent teaching materials, and work with curriculum that is appropriately challenging and developmentally sound to provide high quality education for children in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We are making every effort for all of The Malvern Schools to achieve NAEYC accreditation.

To satisfy a child’s curiosity and need for adventure, we have created two age-appropriate, custom designed rooms where your child will have daily unlimited opportunities to see, touch and do through hands on learning stations.  The learning stations focus on sensory exploration, arts and crafts, reading, manipulative play and dramatic play.  Our Fascination Station is a favorite among our First Step and Toddler children, and the Discovery Room is a special place for our Get Set through After School students.   When you walk into these rooms, you will see children thinking, learning, listening, experimenting, drawing, building, creating, laughing and especially smiling.";http://www.bergenfielddaycare.com/contact.html;;;http://www.malvernschool.com/careers/employment-application;;;y;y;y;y;y;y;;http://www.malvernschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/royersford-f-step-group.jpg;http://www.malvernschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/inf-playground2w.jpg;http://www.malverndaycamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/camp-home-page.jpg;http://www.malvernschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Future-Malvern-Friends.jpg;;

At Evergreen Kids Academy, it’s our belief that a child learns best when every aspect of a child’s development – cognitive, physical, social and emotional – is nurtured. Our Whole Child approach – based on the approach developed by Maria Montessori – concentrates on skills that include early literacy, logical thinking, problem solving,social understanding, physical coordination, creativity and positive character traits, such as cooperation and self-control. It is characterized by an emphasis on independence, freedom within limits, and respect for a child’s natural psychological development. By adhering to this philosophy to help nurture all of these areas of your child’s development, our goal is to create good citizens with a strong intellectual curiosity. At Evergreen Kids Academy, we believe education should be about more than memorization and repetition. We offer a completely different approach, with a unique, open environment that emphasizes your child’s natural interests and allows your child to set his or her own development pace. The practical application of sensory-based and self-directed learning for children is the most important thread that runs through our Toddler and Primary programs. Language, mathematics, spatial learning, self-discovery, music and art – they’re all incorporated into our approach. Every Evergreen Kids Academy teacher will work with your child to individually encourage her to explore the areas that excite and engage her. As children master an exercise, we guide them to the next appropriate challenge.  Students will be treated as equals, and respected as individuals with their own unique thoughts, ideas, perspectives, and talents. ;http://www.evergreenkidsacademy.com/contact-us-1.html;;;;;;n;n;y;y;y;y;;http://nebula.wsimg.com/7002d1d12ae98ceb9874559664407756?AccessKeyId=9069A4E6E32DD89DD565&disposition=0&alloworigin=1;http://nebula.wsimg.com/e7e1bc81aaf4817a2880c0b9787fd38e?AccessKeyId=9069A4E6E32DD89DD565&disposition=0&alloworigin=1;http://nebula.wsimg.com/2e68ae89792736b65ece8eace53fd503?AccessKeyId=9069A4E6E32DD89DD565&disposition=0&alloworigin=1;http://nebula.wsimg.com/a47197d788d5c9e0115a034343a95fcf?AccessKeyId=9069A4E6E32DD89DD565&disposition=0&alloworigin=1;;

We value partnerships with our families as the building block of our center. We respect parents as a child’s first advocate, and we work collaboratively to ensure that familes are involved in ongoing healthy iStock_000007925507XSmallemotional, psychological, and educational development in all children. We build strong partnerships between home and center to encourage sharing of cultures, ideas, knowledge, strengths and differences. Collaboration between families and our center is essential to growth and development of the individual child. Together we work at the task of providing a strong foundation for each child’s life.

We believe in students capabilities to learn repect, and responsibility and to learn to care for others, and see themselves as constructive contributors of the community. We believe that learning how to get along with others is a life-long skill. Teachers facilitate problem solving, assist children in making positive choices, and help them develop appropriate solutions. Our staff strives to help children learn how they have an impact on others, to recognize their emotions and express them in acceptable ways.

Children’s learning and growth are seen as intertwined. We recognize the importance of play on the learning process. Our philosophy is that play is a child’s work, and fosters all aspects of development. Play is the source of laughter, humor, of inventiveness and beauty. It allows children to entertain possibilities and envision the future. During active play, a child’s mind, body and emotions develop and true learning takes place.

Our teachers support children’s acquisition of skills, knowledge and dispositions for learning (concepts or facts, physical and social tasks, curiosity or friendliness.) We prepare each child to enter kindergarten academically ready, and confident of their abilities, and we may help them achieve a lifelong love of learning.

Our schools are open year round with full and half day enrollment options.

The curriculum is designed to meet or exceed the standards established by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the nation’s largest early childhood accrediting organization. Programs that meet NAEYC’s standards of excellence provide an environment with a focus on health and safety, have teachers who are well trained, have access to excellent teaching materials, and work with curriculum that is appropriately challenging and developmentally sound to provide high quality education for children in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We are making every effort for all of The Malvern Schools to achieve NAEYC accreditation.

To satisfy a child’s curiosity and need for adventure, we have created two age-appropriate, custom designed rooms where your child will have daily unlimited opportunities to see, touch and do through hands on learning stations.  The learning stations focus on sensory exploration, arts and crafts, reading, manipulative play and dramatic play.  Our Fascination Station is a favorite among our First Step and Toddler children, and the Discovery Room is a special place for our Get Set through After School students.

At that time the Church felt there was a need in the community for a quality childcare facility for children of working parents.

The Church members wanted a center that made the children and the parents feel safe and secure as well as a center that provided a stimulating environment in which a child would be provided many opportunities to examine and explore the world around him or her.  Thus, the Farmingdale First UMC Daycare was created.

The Philosophy of the Center has not changed in the last 39 years.  The center is committed to providing quality childcare for working parents at affordable rates.  However as time changes, so have the needs of the children.  Rote learning or memorizing used to be the norm for teaching young children.  Studies have shown that the young child learns by ""hands on experiences"" and that all areas of the curriculum are intertwined with each other. 

It is the goal of this Center to provide a secure and stimulating environment in which your child will be able to play, interact with others, and successfully develop a positive self image as well as establish a strong foundation for learning.  It is also our goal to relate to each child as an individual with individual needs and interests.

";http://libertymontessori.org/;;"Most childcare resource groups agree that there's no ""one-size-fits-all"" when it comes to child care. However, there are basics to look for which will ensure that your children are well cared for. We know Liberty Montessori: The Place for Learning is the best choice as a childcare provider for children ages 6 weeks to 6 years old.  (Licensed for up to 13 years old.)  And, we believe after getting to know us, you will agree! Here's why.

baby at playThere are more than 30 daycare, childcare, preschool locations in proximity to the 07305 area. We visited most as we sought daycare for our own grandchild. We used our senses to help us evaluate the environment. This is the criteria we started using in evaluating the centers:
    Does it smell clean and fresh, or is there a lingering odor?
    Do the kids sound involved in play or structured activities; e.g., reading time circle time? Or is there a television on blaring some ""educational program""? How do the adults talk to the children? Is there shouting? Are the voices edgy? Are they engaged in quiet talking?
    Are there a variety of (play) areas?
    Are the floors carpeted, supported with padding and floor cushions?
    Are there areas for reading, areas for indoor ball or block play, and eating areas? If there is a designated outdoor play area, is it fenced, clean and spacious?
    Is the daycare aesthetically pleasing? Would you want to spend your day there?
    Are staff (teachers and teacher assistants) professionally experienced in daycare?
    Are teachers provided with on-going training?
    What is the daycare center's policy on hand-washing? This is a very important issue. The number one cause of infections in daycares is improper or infrequent hand-washing.
    What is the daycare center's policy concerning background checks and credentialing?
    How often did the center conduct fire drills, and what were the disaster procedures, and emergency procedures if our child is hurt or ill?

We carefully analyzed costs as compared to service hours and quality. Most important we researched the daycare centers' philosophies on education and discipline. We sought a loving, nurturing, safe, secure environment that provides a strong educational foundation. What started out as a project to find the best care for our grandchild ended up as a blueprint for creating our own daycare/early learning center where parents find uncompromising safety, securing, and exceptional quality at reasonable rates.";http://libertymontessori.org/;;7:30 am to 6:00 pm;;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;http://libertymontessori.org/images/liberty_logo.png;http://libertymontessori.org/cache/widgetkit/gallery/5/IMG_0260-16931e5624.JPG;http://libertymontessori.org/cache/widgetkit/gallery/5/IMG_0239-f0745817ab.JPG;http://libertymontessori.org/cache/widgetkit/gallery/5/IMG_0242-bb34d810ce.JPG;http://libertymontessori.org/cache/widgetkit/gallery/5/IMG_0241-8e1943be41.JPG;;

FLCA staff plan and facilitate these experiences for the total development of your child.  We celebrate cultural diversity and incorporate multicultural perspectives throughout our curriculum.

After developing a sound vision and mission the years that followed were spent gathering Best Practices experiences, data, collaborating with schools, working through curriculum, understanding the laws and regulations of the State and finding the right home for our school.

In 2012 a home was found in Vineland, NJ and we invited families from Pittsgrove, Millville and Vineland to register with the school. After a Planning Year was granted from the State we formally opened our doors in September 2013.

Dr. Christine Johnston, Lead Researcher of the Let Me Learn Process, said in the ground breaking ceremony in early September, “We are not a school that you choose because you have no other choice; we are the only school of choice for educational excellence.” She continued, “Our goal and promise to our families and the surrounding communities is to break the backs of poverty in Cumberland and Salem Counties and we will do so each day, all year, one learner at a time.”";http://www.compassacademycharter.org/parent-resources/compass-care/;https://www.facebook.com/compassacademycharterschool.org;"Mon - Fri:

Children naturally love and enjoy music. Starting with our 2's class, all of our children have a weekly 30 minute music class.

Early Head Start;322 PARK AVENUE;PLAINFIELD;NJ;7060;UNION;(908) 954-1830;http://www.hopes.org/Early-Childhood-Services.html;;"HOPES offers Early Head Start (Expectant Women, Infants and Toddlers), Head Start (Preschool), and State Funded Preschool programs at a variety of locations in Hudson and Union Counties, NJ.

As one of the first established Head Start programs in the country, in 1966, HOPES Head Start prides itself on its continuous service of high quality educational programs for children and support services for families.

Funded by the Federal Government, Early Head Start (EHS) and Head Start (HS) are comprehensive child development programs serving expectant women, children from birth to age five and their families. The programs are child-focused and have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low-income families.

Both programs provide a range of individualized services in the areas of education, medical, dental and mental health, nutrition and social services to children and their families. Parent involvement is encouraged and support is offered for children with disabilities. Ten percent of the programs' total enrollment opportunities are made available to children with disabilities, without regard to family income.

The cornerstone of the Early Head Start/Head Start Programs is parent and community involvement - which has made it one of the most successful early childhood education programs in the country. There are rigorous requirements that must be met in order to be in compliance with all Head Start Program Performance Standards. For more information on Head Start, visit The Office of Head Start website.

HOPES Early Childhood locations also provide State Funded Preschool programs that enable residents of Hoboken and Plainfield School Districts to have their age and residency eligible child attend the preschool program free of charge. Visit the New Jersey Department of Education for more information about the New Jersey State Funded Preschool Program (Formerly Abbott Preschool).";http://www.hopes.org/Early-Childhood-Services.html;https://www.facebook.com/HOPESCAPInc;;;;;y;y;y;y;n;n;http://www.hopes.org/IMG/Logo-HOPES-Lockup.jpg;http://www.hopes.org/IMG/EC-Services-3.jpg;http://www.hopes.org/IMG/EC-Head-start-2.jpg;http://www.hopes.org/IMG/EC-Services.jpg;;;

As you take a look around our school, you will see the classes are divided into centers. The center-based learning approach is designed to help children have control in their learning, while the teacher guides the activities.

Our Curriculum is made up of monthly units and weekly themes. As you take a look around you will see weekly lesson plans posted in each classroom to show the activities the children will be doing. These lesson plans are divided into categories which align with the New Jersey State Department of Education’s Preschool Teaching and Learning Standards. All of the activities the teachers plan are directly related to these teaching and learning standards.

Our goal for your child is to create a safe and nurturing learning environment where they are able to reach their potential in all areas of development. Not only do we focus on their cognitive abilities with Language, math and science centers, we also focus on their creativity as they play in the music, dramatic play, block and art centers. We also want to see their motor skills develop and we do so by providing a wide array of fine and gross motor activities.  We also acknowledge that technology is the future and we provided computers for the older children to get acquainted and play with.
