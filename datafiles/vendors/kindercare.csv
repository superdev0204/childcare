We have 10 classrooms, allowing us to meet the needs of the children in our care through quality curriculum that is designed to focus on what we do best: helping your child learn through play.  Our curriculum is carefully thought out and planned through our Education Department to allow both teacher directed and child directed activities throughout the day.

Our center provides well balanced nutritional meals daily.  We have a 4 week rotating menu, providing a variety of healthy meals to the children.  We serve breakfast, lunch, and 2 afternoon snacks.

We are conveniently located off of 117th Avenue in the Orchard's area of Vancouver, Washington with quick access to Highway 500 and I-205.  We have eleven classrooms and care for and educate children from six weeks to 12 years. 
Here at Orchard's KinderCare our focus is on providing families with a safe environment in which their children will be educated. Early in a child's life, it is important to create a desire and love for learning.  This is what we strive to do each day.  Our curriculum is based on the belief that children learn best by doing and playing and supports whole-child growth - socially, emotionally, and educationally.  
To support children's physical growth we have three large playgrounds that are individualized for the different age groups.  Each playground has age appropriate equipment and play structures to support the children's physical growth. The gates on the playgrounds are alarmed to ensure the children remain safe while they are outdoors.
Our school provides nutritious meals and follows the USDA food program.  We have four rotating menus to expose the children to the same foods multiple times which encourages them to try new, nutritious foods.  We offer breakfast each morning, lunch, an afternoon snack, and a small evening snack to satisfy the children's tummies until dinner.  
Safety is also an important focus for us.  We have a keypad entry system which is changed regularly to maintain security for our students.  All of our staff are certified in CPR and First Aid for infants, children, and adults.  Our school has a health and safety coordinator who ensures that our center is following safe practices at all times.  The center director is also the health and safety lead for the entire Vancouver district.  
We would love to have you and your child come tour our school so you can see first hand the great things we have to offer.  Feel free to contact us anytime to schedule a tour just drop by.

We know what at challenge it can be to find quality early childhood education for your child(ren). Here at KinderCare we offer a variety of programs to meet the needs of children as young as six weeks and as old as 12 years.  Our Education Department utilizes the latest brain research and development when establishing our curriculum.  This ensures that we are teaching your child with the latest in brain research technology in mind.  

Each age group has specific needs and our curriculum is made for those needs.  For example, our Preschool 3 Classroom is preparing children for Kindergarten.  They work on letter recognition, writing, simple math skills as well as positive social interaction.  However, our Toddlers have a much higher need to be safe, from themselves as well as the outside world, so their day is largely spent mastering social skills and “appropriate behavior”. 

One thing that makes us unique is our attention to the whole family.  We have an open door policy for parents that are enrolled here.  We encourage parents to come in unexpectedly to visit as well as come to our many family centered functions.  For the safety of the children, we have a coded door that limits access to those parents that do not have children enrolled.

In our ongoing effort to meet each family’s needs, we offer three curricular programs. Our Core Curriculum is developing the five learning domains. The Enhanced  Curriculum adds in three weekly small group (three students) sessions that develop strong literacy skills.  The Excelled Curriculum is our most comprehensive program, incorporating the  features of the Core, the Enhanced and adds in three weekly small group (three students) sessions to develop strong mathematical skills.

We care about their growth and development cognitively, socially, physically and emotionally.  It matters to us that they learn everyday and enjoy the process of discovery and exploration.  It is our hope that we are contributing to the creation of happy, life long learners who will take the world “by storm” some day.  I love my job here at KinderCare working with you, your children and my teaching team. 
Infants grow and learn every day. We provide a safe and nurturing “home away from home” where infants can explore and make new discoveries. 
As toddlers develop friendships, self-esteem, and curiosity, our program will help them explore their world in a safe and nurturing environment. 
When two-year-old's begin to express their independence, our program introduces them to a world of learning, sharing, and exploring. Our classroom engages young minds with the early learning fundamentals they’ll need as they continue on to preschool, with a rich blend of music, art, and dramatic play.  
Our preschool program enhances that confidence by providing activities to help children become problem solvers and lifelong learners. Through independent exploration, structured activities, and hands-on learning, children develop early literacy, mathematics, science, and social skills.
Prekindergarten children are preparing for the adventure of a lifetime. The Prekindergarten program is designed to get them ready by teaching letters and words, math concepts, and valuable social skills. With small group instruction, independent play in an organized atmosphere, and large-group activities, children will have all the right skills to hop, skip, and jump into kindergarten. 
Our kindergarten program helps them explore, communicate, and create —all in a nurturing, small-class setting.  We present our unique curriculum of reading, language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and physical fitness in an engaging way that encourages a lifelong love of learning.
Our school age program is for before and after school children which during that time we help with homework and have fun activities to finish off their day.  We transport to the following schools: Beaver Acres, Elmonica, McKinley, Five Oaks, Kinnaman, Barnes, Valley Catholic, Imlay, Orenco, Tobias, Indian Hills, Ladd Acres, Reedville, Qutama.";Infant Programs (6 Weeks – 1 Year), Toddler Programs (1 – 2 Years), Discovery Preschool Programs (2 – 3 Years), Preschool Programs (3 – 4 Years), Prekindergarten Programs (4 – 5 Years), Private Kindergarten Programs (5–6 Years), Before and After School Programs (5–12 Years), Summer Programs (preschool, prekindergarten, and school-age);Infant Programs, Toddler Programs, Discovery Preschool Programs, Preschool Programs, Prekindergarten Programs, Private Kindergarten Programs, Before and After School Programs, Summer Programs;2Months - 12 Years
