We will work with the Racine Unified School District to ensure that All slots for four year olds will be able to access at least six hours a day, five days a week. We are working closely with the school district to become an established 4-K provider, and families eligible for Wisconsin Shares will be able to receive additional hours before and after the regular day at every one of our locations. In addition, next summer (2014), we will even offer summer services for every child who can attend. This should mean many more hours of educational learning for EVERY child enrolled.

Our goal is to continue to operate all of the current Head Start sites next year --- and we are currently in negotiations with each landlord to ensure those same facilities will be used as Head Start centers. Once we reach agreement with the current landlords, we will be working all summer long to spruce up the current Head Start sites so children and families can return to the highest-quality classroom environments.

Our temporary headquarters for the Head Start program will be located in the Next Generation Now Facility at 1220 Mound Avenue.

The Mount Horeb area is rich with Norwegian heritage: Vikings, trolls, lefse and all. 

We like to think of ourselves as voyageurs in learning, where every Little Viking will participate and partake in learning voyages filled with fun, new ideas, treasures of skills and forged friendships. Our ship will set sail just in time for your child to join us on our adventure through learning and endless discoveries.

We look forward to many journeys, which include: language and literacy; mathematics; science; social and emotional development; fine and gross motor skills; music and movement; Spanish; and much more!

Our goal is to help our Little Vikings build a foundation of skills, concepts and sense of self that will prepare them for their life-long journey in learning.";"http://littlevikings4k.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Little-Vikings-4K-Childcare-LLC/422516611155633";"Mon - Fri:

Relationship is the force that drives our center. It is reflected in our policies, established to help children spend as much time as possible with parents and as little time as possible in our care. It is reflected in the strength of our bond with each child and each family. We strive to develop life-long relationships and help children become the unique individuals God created them to be.
Kings Kids Academy is a Christ-Centered child care center that accepts children regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, creed, political persuasion, ancestry, handicapping condition or age (if an opening is available in the requested age group). Children are accepted between the ages of six weeks through five years, with special programs for after school and Summer camp for five to twelve years old.
As a Christ centered day care we use Bible stories as part of our curriculum to teach children kindness and caring for one another and to help them see the Fingerprints of God all around them.
Our staff, facilities and curriculum exceed the standards established by the State of Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services. Our teachers, assistants and volunteers are committed to establishing a strong nurturing bond with each child in his/her care. We work closely with parents to make their child’s time away from them filled with love, fun and a strong sense of belonging.
Every child is a unique, marvelous gift from God and we consider it a privilege to partner with parents to raise happy, well adjusted children.";"http://kingskids-academy.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/KingsKidsAcademy";"Mon - Fri:

We will work with the Racine Unified School District to ensure that All slots for four year olds will be able to access at least six hours a day, five days a week. We are working closely with the school district to become an established 4-K provider, and families eligible for Wisconsin Shares will be able to receive additional hours before and after the regular day at every one of our locations. In addition, next summer (2014), we will even offer summer services for every child who can attend. This should mean many more hours of educational learning for EVERY child enrolled.

Our goal is to continue to operate all of the current Head Start sites next year --- and we are currently in negotiations with each landlord to ensure those same facilities will be used as Head Start centers. Once we reach agreement with the current landlords, we will be working all summer long to spruce up the current Head Start sites so children and families can return to the highest-quality classroom environments.

Our temporary headquarters for the Head Start program will be located in the Next Generation Now Facility at 1220 Mound Avenue.

We work with children between the ages of 3-5 and their families. We currently receive federal funding for 55 children with supplemental funding from the State for 3 children. As a branch in the Education Department, our staff has demonstrated dedication to the children in our community. Collectively we have 175 years of longevity within our program.

Our hours of operation are from 8:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m.. We have children on site between the hours of 9:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Through the USDA and the State of Wisconsin we provide a healthy breakfast and lunch for each child present.

Our Mission statement is: The place to be happy is here, the time to be happy is now. We take our jobs seriously, while enjoying the blessed moments we get to share with our children, our families, and each other.

Our service area is the Bad River reservation and the City of Ashland. We have three buses that transport our children safely to our center. Each bus is equipped with five point harnesses to ensure that our children are secure in transit.

Aside from transportation we provide early childhood educational services meeting the Wisconsin Model Early Learning Standards as well as Head Start Performance Standards. As part of the daily lesson plans in the classrooms, we incorporate as much Ojibwe language as possible. We also learn and explore seasonal harvesting including: maple syrup and dip netting. We teach the children to respect our earth by celebrating Earth Day every year and doing our part to keep mother earth clean.

Professional development is part of our philosophy and practice here at Head Start. We currently meet the minimum degree requirements as determined by Head Start Authorization Act. The devoted employees are completing long term education goals, and continuing to work towards higher educational degrees and certifications.

When working with young children health concerns are such an integral part of their daily lives. We work with the Bad River Clinic and the The Lakes Clinic to provide health and dental screenings to our children as well as any necessary follow-up care.

There is a strong family component to our program and we are proud to say that we have 100% of our families that participate in our program throughout the year. All parents are welcome to stop in for lunch, breakfast, or just to say hi.

For the 2010-2011 year we are full and currently have a waiting list. If you are interested in obtaining an application at this time please contact Gina Secord, Family Services/Transportation Manager.

We also believe that the early years are the most important and crucial times for a child’s physical, emotional, social, intellectual, creative, and spiritual development.  As Christians and as teachers of young children, we will strive daily to provide each of God’s children with rich, engaging, challenging, and faith-filled experiences in a safe, loving, and nurturing environment.  We will also dedicate ourselves to the families we serve by making ourselves available to attend to their concerns and needs.  It is our prayer that we will sufficiently and successfully bring faith and a love for God to our children, families, and community.   

Our program operates year round, Monday through Friday from 6:30 am to 6:00 pm.  Children who attend SPLPCC must be at least three years old at the time of enrollment and need to be toilet trained.  If your child will be attending during lunch time (11:30 – 12:30), you will need to provide a packed lunch.  SPLPCC will provide milk, plates, cups, eating utensils, and napkins.  We have a refrigerator and a microwave so feel free to pack leftovers!  If your child will be attending in the afternoon, you will need to provide a sleeping bag that is stored in a sealed container (we prefer a plastic “Rubbermaid” type container with a lid).  The children go outside everyday so “weather appropriate” outdoor clothing is also required. 

From September through May, we offer a preschool program Monday through Thursday from 8:30 am – 11:00.  In addition we offer child care from 6:30 – 8:30am and 11:00am – 6:00pm, Monday through Thursday and all day on Fridays.  In addition, we offer “Before and After” school child care for children attending the Cumberland Schools.  The Cumberland Bus Service provides transportation to and from our program and the elementary school.   If your child will be enrolled in Cumberland’s 4 year old kindergarten program, “The Early Learning Center” (ELC), he/she can be transported from SPLPCC to ELC for the afternoon session only.  If your child will be enrolled in the morning session at ELC, and would like to attend SPLPCC in the afternoon, you will need to provide transportation for your child from ELC to SPLPCC at 11:30. 

During the summer months, SPLPCC offers a relaxed curriculum with lots of outdoor learning in a unique Christian environment for a mixed age of children.  For those children attending the Cumberland School District’s excellent summer school program, The Cumberland Bus Service will provide transportation from SPLPCC to Cumberland Elementary for summer school.  Children will be picked up here in time for the first session which begins at 8:30 and will be brought back to SPLPCC after the last session is over which ends at 12:00.  If your child’s class starts after 8:30 or their class ends before 12:00, you will be responsible for transportation. 

As a ministry extension of St. Paul Lutheran Church, there are times throughout the year when we participate in church functions, such as Saturday evening and Sunday morning services.  During these times, the children may be asked to join in activities, such as singing for the congregation.  There may also be other preschool specific activities like Family Night, sponsored by the church.  Finally, SPLPCC is a non-profit organization, and relies on fundraising to maintain affordable rates, yet provide a quality environment.  All families are encouraged to participate in Church events, church sponsored events, and fundraising endeavors.  In the past years we have seen such opportunities bring a great sense of community and closeness amongst our families, as well as a stronger connection to the church family that support the care and education of ";"http://www.stpaulcumberland.com/preschool/about-splpcc";;;;"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5pkVEk479H-UnpnUHFMUloyY0E/edit?pli=1";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

We strive to create a caring, loving, and nurturing environment, one that promotes both individual learning as well as group learning.  Children learn in so many different ways, and we feel that it is necessary for them to have the proper tools that will lead to new experiences, and help to enhance their abilities and strengths even further.  Learning requires active thinking, and hands on activities to let them learn first hand about the world around them.  A child that is absorbed in the positive components of life has little time to focus on the negatives.

We want our children to grow up with the knowledge that they can make a positive difference in their life, as well as in the lives of others around them.  It is our goal as caregivers and educators to help each child achieve his/her own level of excellence.  To do this, we need to work as a team.  This means that our center will work with you, the parents, in projecting the most positive influence possible.

We all want the best for our children; they are our future, and we must never lose sight of that fact.  As a community of caregivers and parents, we need to
work together to make that future as bright as it possibly can be;
for each and every child.

Established initially in 2000 by a devoted and energetic group of parents and led by a Montessori directress, it remains true to the Montessori philosophy and curriculum. The carefully constructed environment is a literal children’s garden of activities. Because the parents have assumed most of the administrative roles, the directress can focus entirely on working with the 12 children in the classroom.

Through small groups, a low staff-child ratio, and dedicated teachers, we get to know the children in our care. We believe in meeting children's needs, rather than merely fitting them into our program. The foundation of Bernie's program is based on the personal relationship between teacher and child. As friends, parent figures, playmates and models, we become an important part of each child's life. Each child becomes an important part of our lives as well.

Developmentally Appropriate Education
We believe children learn by doing. By carefully preparing materials and the surroundings, our teachers use the natural curiosity and energy of a child's own desire to explore. Our teachers plan both small group and free-choice activities designed to meet the individual needs, interests, and learning styles of young children. Our priority is the healthy development of the whole child; physical, social, emotional and cognitive, rather than accelerated acquistion of academic skills. In our experience, emphasizing the former promotes the latter.

A Safe, Healthy and Stimulating Environment
Bernie's Place is located in a large, converted home with two floors and outdoor playground. This provides a wide variety of supportive and challenging environments: wood working, dramatic play, block building, fine motor center, books, games, puzzles, art with a variety of media, indoor and outdoor play and climbing spaces. Our space accommodates active and quiet play as well as large group and individual encounters. Moreover, we provide nutritious, home-cooked vegetarian meals and many opportunities to learn and practice personal hygiene and safety.

4K Program
Bernie's Place is a Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) site that will have a 4-year-old kindergarten program beginning on September 1, 2011. Participation in this 4K program does not change our learning philosophy.";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/";"https://www.facebook.com/UWMadisonOCCFR";"Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.";;"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Enrollment.htm";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/BerniesPlace_UW-Madison.jpg";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/home.jpg";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/Art.JPG";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/enrollment.jpg";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/Snack.JPG";;

We offer year-round programs for children ages six weeks to five years. The Program provides developmentally and culturally appropriate early learning experiences for children in safe, relationship-based classrooms. We model best teaching and learning practices based on research and contemporary theories of child development. An integral component of our developmental curriculum is learning through inquiry.
Research has shown that programs that participate in the voluntary accreditation process are typically of higher quality because the accreditation standards exceed the mandatory regulations required by the State of Wisconsin.
Both sites of the PSL are currently accredited by the City of Madison Office of Community Services.

Our teachers utilize a theme approach in planning a curriculum and environment that encourages self-discovery, hands on manipulation of materials, and activities that are meaningful and appropriate for young children.

Regard for children’s development in all areas (social intellectual, emotional and physical) is the heart of our philosophy. Our daily program schedule incorporates many opportunities for children to acquire and build skills in these areas.

UHP Parent Cooperative provides a high quality child initiated program, which is stimulating and safe in a developmentally appropriate environment for young children.

We are justifiably proud of our school’s program, underlying philosophies and dedicated teaching staff. We believe our preschool offers an important first learning experience for young children. Our international population provides many opportunities for learning about and encouraging a natural interest and respect for a diverse range of cultures.

Our school’s small size, home-like setting and mixed age grouping further encourage a supportive familial environment. We find this environment conducive to building a strong self-concept and a positive introduction to life long learning for the children.

As a parent cooperative, we value a strong home/school partnership and give families many opportunities to take an active role in all aspects of our school including: working with professional staff in the classroom, program support and evaluation, center/family social events, and policy making.";"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/University-Houses-Preschool/109391492432389";"8:45am-3pm";;"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/enrollment";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/images/UHP_logo2.jpg";"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/images/pictures/images_kids_blue_playtime.jpg";"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/images/pictures/images_kids_orange_artsandcrafts.jpg";"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/images/pictures/images_kids_blue_costumes.jpg";"http://uhpparentcooperative.org/images/pictures/images_kids_green_painting.jpg";;

Adventures in Learning takes a holistic approach to early childhood education. At the core of our philosophy, we believe that each child is unique and therefore deserves individual attention and care. Because of their innate curiosity, it is up to us,  at Adventures in Learning to develop suitable activities based on our observations of each child's individual needs.

Our curriculum reflects this comprehensive and highly individualized approach. Kids are divided into different groups during one part of the day in an effort to provide them with developmentally appropriate activities. At other times, children of all ages play together in order to learn from one another – the younger ones as learners, the older kids as role models.

In addition to the basic skills required for a lifetime of learning, Adventures in Learning imparts values such as creativity, self-reliance, compassion and respect for diversity. In order to achieve this goal, it is essential for us to work closely with you, the parents, to provide the best possible situation for your children.";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/";;" 7:00 am - 5:30 pm";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/job-opportunities/";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/enrollment-forms/";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/enrollment-forms/";"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/s/misc/logo.jpg?t=1421372975";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/s/cc_images/cache_4086443646.jpg?t=1386778183";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/s/cc_images/cache_4086263865.jpg?t=1385495140";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/s/cc_images/cache_3517673304.jpg?t=1349194210";"http://www.adventures-in-learning.info/s/cc_images/cache_4086263675.jpg?t=1385494273";;

Sara spent 12 years working in corporate childcare in every capacity from teacher to regional director. She realized her beliefs and philosophy for children under the age of 5 were very different from what this corporation was dictating.

Candace Page (mother) a Registered Nurse, was ready to retire her position with the state after 30 years of caring for adults and children.

Together, they bought a farmette, and built a preschool in the perfect spot to offer children an educational program in a natural setting.

We originally began at the Central Campus as a morning program, but soon expanded to morning and afternoon classes. Growth of Good Shepherd to the West Campus necessitated the need for a second location for Little Blessings. This expansion took place in the fall of 2006 to serve families in the Verona area.

We are a private, non-profit, early childhood program that is licensed by the State Department of Health and Family Services. The purpose of licensing is to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of children in childcare centers. Periodic visits are made by a state Daycare Licensing Specialist who inspects the school’s records and facility to maintain state requirements.

Our philosophy is based on the premise that children learn through play. Attention is given to the child's total development with emphasis placed upon developing the child's self-concept and social skills. We use a theme based curriculum in which the teachers direct certain activities and also allow time for children directed activities.

The teachers are warm and caring individuals who have earned Bachelor’s degrees in Early Childhood or related fields. The program is designed to be developmentally appropriate, respecting the uniqueness and diversity of each of its students.";"http://www.gslcwi.com/little-blessings-preschool";;"8:30-3:00";;"http://www.gslcwi.com/little-blessings-preschool";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.gslcwi.com/images/page/specific/little_blessings.jpg";;;;;;

Through small groups, a low staff-child ratio, and dedicated teachers, we get to know the children in our care. We believe in meeting children's needs, rather than merely fitting them into our program. The foundation of Bernie's program is based on the personal relationship between teacher and child. As friends, parent figures, playmates and models, we become an important part of each child's life. Each child becomes an important part of our lives as well.

Developmentally Appropriate Education
We believe children learn by doing. By carefully preparing materials and the surroundings, our teachers use the natural curiosity and energy of a child's own desire to explore. Our teachers plan both small group and free-choice activities designed to meet the individual needs, interests, and learning styles of young children. Our priority is the healthy development of the whole child; physical, social, emotional and cognitive, rather than accelerated acquistion of academic skills. In our experience, emphasizing the former promotes the latter.

A Safe, Healthy and Stimulating Environment
Bernie's Place is located in a large, converted home with two floors and outdoor playground. This provides a wide variety of supportive and challenging environments: wood working, dramatic play, block building, fine motor center, books, games, puzzles, art with a variety of media, indoor and outdoor play and climbing spaces. Our space accommodates active and quiet play as well as large group and individual encounters. Moreover, we provide nutritious, home-cooked vegetarian meals and many opportunities to learn and practice personal hygiene and safety.

4K Program
Bernie's Place is a Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) site that will have a 4-year-old kindergarten program beginning on September 1, 2011. Participation in this 4K program does not change our learning philosophy. To enroll, please refer to information provided on the MMSD web site.";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/";;"Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.";;"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Enrollment.htm";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/BerniesPlace_UW-Madison.jpg";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/home.jpg";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/Art.JPG";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/staff.jpg";"http://www.occfr.wisc.edu/bernies/Images/enrollment.jpg";;

That's why our child care programs are staffed with people who understand the cognitive, physical and social development of kids, the need children have to feel connected and supported in trying new things, and the caring and reinforcement parents and families need to help each other.";"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/child-care";;;;"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/register";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/images/ymca.png";"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/content/images/Programs/Child%20Care/childcare.jpg";"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/content/images/Programs/Child%20Care/photo201005_0603_12_download_3.jpg";"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/content/images/Programs/Child%20Care/20110305_YMCA_0070_download_3.jpg";"http://www.ymcadanecounty.org/content/images/Programs/Child%20Care/ymca-child-watch.png";;

She provided care for 8 children daily from 7 AM till 5:30 PM Monday – Friday.

Our program first expanded into school age care in 1997 by adding the first “Kid’s Club” Before & after School Program, which was named Footville Before & After School Program and held in the Footville elementary school at 121 Janesville Street in Footville, WI. This program cared for children of the Parkview School District and is still in existence today and is owned & operated by Dawn Wells.

The first Belleville site was added in the fall of 2000 when a survey determined that several children were in need of some type of after school care. “Kid’s Club” After School Program / Elem opened in the Belleville Elementary School at 237 Pearl Street, Belleville, WI on September 1st, 2000. This program cared for children, from both the Intermediate & elementary schools, after school until 5:30 PM nightly, as well as additional school days off. “Kid’s Club” received a $25,000.00 grant to start the program from the Department of Workforce and Development. After an increase in enrolment at this site an additional after school program was added and was called “Kid’s Club” After School Program / Int and opened at the Belleville Intermediate School (in the basement / old art room) at 101 South Grant Street in Belleville, WI in September of 2003. Both after school sites currently care for 20-25 children nightly and are still in operation today.

After several years of providing after school care in Belleville the first summer program began on June 11th, 2004 in the Belleville Jr. High School at 625 West Church Street in Belleville, WI. The “Kid’s Club” Summer Day Camp / Belleville enrolled 8 children the first year, and in 2005 enrollment jumped to 32 children daily, and in 2006 enrollment reached 50 children, where it remains today.

The “Kid’s Club” Summer Day Camp / Evansville opened in the Evansville Intermediate School at 340 Fair Street on June 10th, 2012. The Enrollment during the summer of 2012 was 8 children and since has grown to 20 children for the summer of 2013. This program is still in operation today and cares for school age children during the summer months only.

The most recent expansion for “Kid’s Club” Learning Centers Inc. will take place on May 1st, 2013 when it will open “Kid’s Club” Childcare Center at 420 West Highway 11 in Footville, WI. This expansion was brought about since the recent closure of two group centers in the Footville area which opened up a significant need for this type of center in the Footville area. This site will care for infants – school age children 6 AM-6 PM Monday – Friday. It will be open year round.

The staff of the “Kid’s Club” Learning Centers Inc. are excited about what lies ahead for our program. We offer a structured, educational based program with highly educated teachers.

It is our goal to facilitate a child’s transition from the family circle to the larger social circle, and to provide an enjoyable introduction into the educational learning process. We base our program on the premise that a child grows and develops at his/her own rate, but by providing the proper stimulating environment that growth and development will be enhanced. We strive to provide a program to challenge a child’s physical and intellectual abilities, to stimulate curiosity, and to promote self-expression. In these ways, we feel that we are encouraging a child to become a productive person.

Each child is a unique individual with unique needs and contributions. It is our responsibility to recognize and meet these needs and to encourage and respect a child’s contributions. In turn, it is important that children learn to respect each other and work together in harmony within the environment.

Environmentally, it is our responsibility to provide a clean, safe facility in which a child feels secure to explore and comfortably express him/herself. We strongly believe that the environment sets the stage for the child guidance policy. Well-equipped, varied, and stimulating atmosphere can circumvent unacceptable child-to-child interactions. In addition, by providing the proper environment, staff members are able to redirect children to other activities before potential problems occur. When disputes are inevitable, however, children will be encouraged to use proper problem-solving techniques.

We at Ginger Bread House want the best for our children. We want to guide our young children to help them to become productive members of society. Our goal is to foster a sense of commitment and respect for the environment and for each other within each child. We will strive to encourage children to be resourceful and to develop a sense of pride and independence within themselves. We hope through our program to teach children skills which will enable them to meet the challenges of their adult lives.

Pat was working at a childcare center and really wanted to incorporate her visions and dreams into her own center. Always having a passion for children, this would be her chance to make a difference in the lives of the children of Mayville.

Myron was the builder, handyman and pillar of strength to lean on throughout the years. They expanded as their reputation for one of the best quality daycares continued to grow throughout the community. Each year saw the daycare grow more and more to fulfill the needs of the community.

In April of 2010, Myron was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away in June of 2010. Pat was devastated and decided that she could no longer put her whole heart and soul into it without Myron, but didn’t want all they strove hard to accomplish over the years just go to anyone. Tricia Schwechel, Pat and Myron’s daughter, stepped in to keep their dream and hard work alive and strong. Tricia and her husband Larry now own the daycare as of July 1, 2011.

Larry is now the handyman, builder and strength for Tricia. All the same commitment, values, trustworthiness and love for the children is evident as Tricia keeps the quality daycare tradition going strong. The labor of love will go on for many years to come, with the assurance of a safe, loving, learning environment while your most precious children are here at Pattycakes.";"http://pattycakesmayvilledaycare.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/PattycakesDaycareLlc/info?tab=page_info";"Mon - Fri:

Because busy lifestyles require flexibility, we provide scheduling that allows you to schedule your child according to your needs. You pay only for the shifts that you use once you reach at least three hours of care per week, per child, measured in half hour increments.

Our experienced staff is dedicated to the development of each child’s spirit, mind and body. We provide many fun activities to keep children entertained, including arts and crafts, sports and games, imaginative play and time for homework. During summer, we take day trips to farms, baseball games, swimming pools and the library.

Now we offer many different programs from before and after school care, 4 year old kindergarten, 3 and 4 year old preschool, a school-aged summer program, infant and toddler care and a curriculum for all age groups that includes sign language, Spanish, arts, music and more.";"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/?logout=1";;"Monday - Friday, 6:00am to 6:00pm";;"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/enroll-your-child/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/s/misc/logo.jpg?t=1423329135";"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/s/img/emotionheader_1.jpg?1421781614.920px.420px";"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/s/img/emotionheader_3.jpg?1421781614.920px.420px";"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/s/img/emotionheader.jpg?1421781614.920px.420px";"http://s418602897.initial-website.com/s/img/emotionheader_2.jpg?1421781614.920px.420px";;

We offer support to each child as s/he develops emotionally, socially, intellectually and physically in a warm and positive environment. We provide developmentally appropriate activities that focus on the process of learning and help children enjoy successful experiences. We encourage not just learning, but the love of learning.

We believe in providing a physical environment that is safe, clean, healthy and oriented to children. Classrooms are arranged to offer challenging play in learning centers at a variety of developmental levels. Our learning centers allows children the opportunity to explore, to experience, to create and more importantly … to succeed!

We believe the strength or our program is directly related to the dedication of our teaching staff. We support our teachers with training, resources and the freedom to create unique learning experiences for children. We provide various opportunities for our teachers to share ideas and grow professionally. Our teachers create a caring and nurturing atmosphere and foster each child’s creativity and positive self-image.

We believe in using positive guidance techniques to discipline children. We establish consistence, age-appropriate limits to help children function in their world. Our program is designed to develop independence and responsibility in children. We work together to strengthen each child’s own cultural identity as well as teach him/her to respect others who may be different.

We believe parents are the most important adults in a child’s life. We work together to create mutual respect between parents and teachers for the benefit of the child. We encourage daily communication between parents and our staff. Our doors are always open to parents.

Gingerbread values all of the people involved in our center: the children in our care, their parents and our staff. We work hard every day to earn the trust placed in us and to be the best provider of early childhood education in the community.

Our programs focus on developing physical, emotional, social and cognitive skills through a well organized, structured, curriculum designed to stimulate the children's own creativity, imagination and independence.

The development of each child's self-esteem and sense of responsibility is our principal objective. Little Angels Daycare and Preschool understands that children naturally desire to learn and explore at a very young age. We strive to enhance this curiosity while encouraging the children to develop a strong sense of pride and achievement.

Little Angels Daycare & Preschool is the largest daycare franchise in Central Maine. Being the largest has not diminished our ability to cater to the needs of each and every child.

Lincoln School is a diverse and compassionate learning environment where everyone is engaged in a variety of educational opportunities that meet the needs of the whole child.
The school community has high expectations that foster academic success for every student, an intrinsic appreciation for life-long learning, and create socially responsible and globally aware citizens.

Our Beliefs:
Beliefs are core values or guiding principles that drive a school’s everyday actions.  During the 2011-12 school year, the Lincoln Faculty revisited their core beliefs in order to ensure they were clearly stated, and could also be evidenced and measured by our daily intentional actions.    
The following statements are the beliefs of the Lincoln Faculty in regards to students and their performance, school effectiveness, and school and community contexts. ";"http://lincoln.wausauschools.org/";;;"http://wausauschools.org/cms/one.aspx?objectId=3633368";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

At the time the facility was constructed, there were 70 to 90 students per teacher and three students shared each seat. The seating capacity of the six schools in the District was less than 1,100. There were already 2,000 children living in the District. Some children went to school at night because young children could work in the mill during the day. One-fourth of the west side children didn’t even attend school at the time, because the existing schools were too far away; and if they could get transportation to the schools, they were so crowded that they were only allowed to attend for half a day.
The new Franklin School was erected in 1966 on the southeast corner of 5th and Bridge Streets. The old building was still used by the District for overflow from the high school. A tunnel connecting the old school to its playground across the street was closed. The old building was last used for the 1969-70 school year and was then demolished.
The school comprised of 46,316 square feet on 2.57 acres. In 1987, the campus acquired the 500 block of Stark and DeKalb Streets for an enlarged playground. In 1991 and 1996 Franklin School received two building additions.
The school now contains 57,398 square feet and has a campus of 4.16 acres. In 1996 a collaborative effort between the Site Council/PTO, District, and the community provided much needed renovation of the Franklin Elementary School playground. The site was vastly improved and began to be used as a neighborhood park as well as school playground.
At the October 2003 School Board meeting, the Board of Education approved the design development documents for the Franklin Elementary School elevator provided by the architect firm, Seymour Davis Seymour, Inc. Currently, there are 350+ students at Franklin.";"http://franklin.wausauschools.org/after_school";;;;"http://franklin.wausauschools.org/after_school/enrollment_form";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

President, Nancy Buck Ransom, and construction began in 1995. The success of the project is due to the detailed concerns of Mrs. Ransom, along with a well designed building, considerate of its occupants, and the center's outstanding childcare program.

Martinson Architects, Inc. of Green Bay, Wisconsin designed the Crivitz Child Development Center.

The Child Development Center is an 8,750 square foot, state-licensed facility providing daycare for 65 children ages six weeks to twelve years, and is built on the same site as the Crivitz Youth Center.

The Child Development Center's programs are designed for the development of the total child. The staff is loving, caring, and professionally trained to offer quality care and instruction to children and to provide guidance in child rearing for parents.

The Child Development Center provides full day childcare, preschool, and kindergarten readiness programs in which children learn and grow in a warm and nurturing environment.

The Child Development Center and the Youth Center meet the needs of children and youth of all ages. These centers are part of the Crivitz community, not an isolated endeavor. It is the collaborative effort of local citizens, organizations, and the Crivitz Youth Inc. staff.

The Child Development Center is open for operation Monday through Friday 5:45 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. the Center is closed on weekends and holidays.

We encourage open communication between teachers and parents. Positive early learning experiences are important in your child’s growth and development.

We believe that guidance by skilled, trained teachers allows all aspects of your child’s physical, emotional, social and mental development to flourish. Our developmentally appropriate classroom will encourage imagination and natural inquisitiveness for learning. Activities are planned with the understanding that children learn through experience. There are opportunities for sensory exploration, language development, social friendships, and learning by doing. We will use books, songs, and toys to teach each child that God has made each of them special. We encourage the development of friendships, sharing, positive attitudes and self-esteem for each child.

As part of our belief that learning takes place through play and hands-on experiences, children are encouraged to develop creativity and critical thinking skills through a balance of structured activities and interactive play.

Together, our parents and teachers grow and learn about child development, parenting, and Jewish life.

Corinne graduated from UW- Stout with a degree in Child Development and Family Life. Tracy graduated from UWMadison with a degree in Early Childhood Education. Corinne and Tracy’s desire to own and operate a child care center that would provide high-quality, educational care for children, was developed while working together for other child care providers.

The first All About Learning, located in West Allis, was opened in 1991. It is still in operation today. In 1993, we opened our second center in Oconomowoc. Our third location opened in 1997 in Waukesha. Our fourth location is in Menomonee Falls, located right on Silver Spring. This center opened in the summer of 2000. We opened our Hartland center in October of 2000. In September 2003 we opened our 6th location on Main Street in Menomonee Falls. In June of 2005 we moved our West Allis center to a new location which is on 106th and Lincoln. In summer of 2007 we opened a brand new facility in Oconomowoc, which offers a huge indoor gym, Birthday party and training room. This new building also offers a high tech Hepa filter and UV system designed to collect 99.9% of airborne particles and allergens including dust mites, bacteria and attached viruses. In addition to this, we have installed in house video monitors and recorder in all classrooms for observation and training.

As we are growing, we are continually finding that the need for quality childcare centers is expansive. All About Learning is a growing company dedicated to maintaining quality. We are consistently looking for ways to improve our services through new technology, higher education, and individualized care. Through the growth of this company we have learned to improve our facilities to better meet the needs of the children, families, staff and community. All of our centers operate under the strict guidelines of the National Accreditation Credentials (NAC) program requirements. To learn more about the Accreditation process and requirements visit the NAC website at: www.naccp.org

All About Learning respects the parent’s/guardian’s role and influence in the care of their child/ren.

Activities are planned which will encourage the child to explore, question, manipulate and create along with opportunities for self-expression, interaction with peers and free play.

    As a development center we recognize that each child is an individual with certain needs. Our program is designed to meet those needs and to aid the child in his or her development.

    With both our full and half (am only) day programs, we offer activities that utilize language development, self-concepts, storytime, music, art, social studies, math, science, fine and gross motor skills.

They realized it takes both parents and children to make a family, and that parents have needs as well. Their pressures, their emotions, their own growth—yes, parents grow too—are realities of families and they are inseparable from the experience of raising children.

Lightbridge Academy was at the forefront of addressing the needs of working parents by offering features such as extended hours and an optional meal plan. Our commitment to moms and dads inspired our 1998 introduction of ParentView® Internet Monitoring, which keeps parents connected to their children even while they’re at work. It also led to our 2011 launch of the Tadpoles App which allows you to receive daily reports and milestone updates—including pictures and video clips—in your inbox throughout the day.

Lightbridge Academy’s brand of family-centered care has been adopted by many over the years. Today, thousands of parents, children, employees and franchisees benefit from our Circle of Care—our term for the supportive relationships and family values that make Lightbridge Academy so special.

The Falzarano’s remain deeply involved in the Lightbridge Academy family today. They guide the policies that shape Lightbridge Academy’s great work. Their children work alongside them and their grandchildren are now experiencing the warm embrace of the centers they’ve helped to create.

We remain committed to doing more for the working families we care so deeply about. In the coming years, we plan to expand our Circle of Care to even more families and communities throughout the Northeast.";"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/LightbridgeAcademy";;"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/careers/";"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/enrollment/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"y";;"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/wp-content/themes/RainbowAcademy/images/slider-4.jpg";"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/wp-content/themes/RainbowAcademy/images/slide1.jpg";"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/wp-content/themes/RainbowAcademy/images/Slider_2.jpg";"http://lightbridgeacademy.com/wp-content/themes/RainbowAcademy/images/slider-3.jpg";;

The Child Care Centers offer a wide variety of learning experiences that encourage children's emotional, social, intellectual and physical development. All four centers have professional staff and modern facilities. Lunch and snacks are provided.

Children must be enrolled in one of the centers on a regular basis, full- or part-time. Fees vary depending on the age of the child and whether regular services are provided full- or part-time. Rates are comparable to many other local child care centers. Fees are to be paid by cash, check, credit card, financial aid or agency sponsorship.

MATC's Child Care Centers are licensed by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services for Group Day Care. The teacher-to-student ratio meets or exceeds the state requirements.

Our center encourages the child’s intellectual, physical and social-emotional development.  We believe each child is unique and has a natural curiosity to learn about her/his environment.  Our staff speaks with the children on their level and treats all children as equals.  We work with them to help them learn and grow at their own pace.

Here our mission is to provide the best possible care at a competitive price.  Since we have not raised our rates for the past two years we feel it necessary to do so at this time.  We continuously monitor our staff and adjust their wages according to their performance.  Keeping a good quality teaching staff for your children is our priority.  Our goal is to keep a stable environment with familiar faces, to do this we must keep pace with our staff wages.
 
All children are arranged in age appropriate classrooms.  Starting with the two-year-old room, children are in a pre-school structure in the morning. 

Each room provides children to play with trucks, blocks, dramatic play, puzzles, books, fine motor activities, gross motor activities and many more new daily experiences.  Rooms have at least two or more of each toy or similar toy.  The children are encouraged by the teachers to share and play nicely with the toys.  This helps the children to understand guidelines and promotes positive behavior.

 Licensing rules for Group Child Care centers requires that all staff be rated with the Registry.  This program rates the education the staff have taken.  The rating range from 1 (Asstistant teacher in child care) to 17 ( Doctorate)  All our staff have been rated these rating levels are located on the staff page .   

 We also participate in the YoungStar program.  Levels are  1(star) - 5 (stars)

882300;"JCC RAINBOW DAY CAMP";"BOX 653 TRAILS END RD";"FREDONIA";"WI";53021;"OZAUKEE";9209944614;"http://rdc.jccmilwaukee.org/";;"Stand outside a local school on the last day of the school year. Be ready to clear the way for the throngs of happy children racing out the doors. Those children know that summer is the happiest time of the year and for many of them, the Albert & Ann Deshur JCC Rainbow Day Camp is the reason why!

Children as young as age 5 can enjoy a terrific summer day camp experience at the JCC’s sprawling facility in Fredonia, WI. The fun begins the very first morning when campers arrive at one of 9 convenient bus stops. Enthusiastic counselors are waiting to greet each and every child and get them geared up for a full day of new experiences and exciting activities including swimming lessons, group time, songs, games, everything a child and parent could ask for in a summer day camp experience. It’s a healthy balance of structured and free playtime along with plenty of peer interaction. A great group of caring, involved and engaged counselors (all over the age of 18 and with previous experience in working with children) provides constant supervision. Legendary camp guru Lenny Kass is at the helm, coordinating all the activities and leading his professional, highly trained and experienced staff.

As your child grows, so does his or her Rainbow Day Camp experience. In 2nd-5th grade, campers can select “Chugim” or clubs from a wide range of choices: gymnastics, archery, ceramics, chess, drama, dance, computers, basketball, climbing wall, candle making, woodworking, the list goes on and on. A highlight of the Rainbow Day Camp summer is spending an overnight at camp two times during each session. There’s even an opportunity for Rainbow Campers to take a trip to visit Camp Interlaken for 3 nights, sleep in a cabin and get a true taste of the JCC’s popular overnight Jewish camp.

Got a camper who wants to focus on a particular activity like fishing, skateboarding, bugs and swamps, trains, musical theater, sewing, tennis, movie making, etc? We have a camp for that!

Finding it a difficult to occupy your middle schooler or teen? Rainbow has special programs for 6th-11th graders that offer fun camp experiences, leadership training and the right mix of independence and structure as your child makes a smooth transition from camper to Counselor-In-Training (CIT).

Giving all parents a piece of mind knowing their child is safe and in a nurturing environment.
Ever child is a unique individual and is our most precious resource. They are our future.
Our goal is to provide a Creative Curriculum learning program.
The program will center on all aspects of child development, including physical, intellectual, social and emotional developments.
We provide a nurturing, caring atmosphere with friendly and warm teachers who understand young children and their needs.

~Developing Children for Future Success! ~

Teachers facilitate play activities and help supply words for concepts and feeling children express in their play as they learn how to interact with the various elements which comprise their world (situations, environments, and other persons).
In group play, children learn to share, consideration and tolerance for other children, and develop meaningful relationships with others. Importance is placed on overall development of all ages.

Our co-constructed curriculum emerges from the interests and ideas of the children in collaboration with the teachers. We strive to provide a happy and relaxed learning situation that emphasizes the process of learning and the pleasure of discovery.

As part of our belief that learning takes place through play and hands-on experiences, children are encouraged to develop creativity and critical thinking skills through a balance of structured activities and interactive play.

Together, our parents and teachers grow and learn about child development, parenting, and Jewish life. Being a part of a diverse community, we build connections that enrich our everyday living and learning.

We believe that each child is a member of God’s family. We strive to help develop the spiritual growth of each child by modeling manners, courtesy and respect for staff and their peers.

Children will learn through exploration of their learning environment that are developmentally appropriate for each age group. Learning centers are child-oriented to encourage a hands on approach to learning. In this, we guarantee that each child is stimulated at his/her own level of cognitive processing. We use predominately manipulative materials so that the children are actively involved in the thinking and learning processes. The process is facilitated with a professional teaching staff and low student teacher ratio.

Through the close communication and interaction between the parents, teacher and child, we will reach the primary objectives of their child developing creative cognitive skills, acceptable social /emotional behaviors, increased physical skills, an interest in language and literacy and moral responsibilities through the love of God .

The center is open Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  In 2011, FLF collaborated with the Janesville School District by adding the P4J (Preschool for Janesville) program as the part of Faith Lutheran Church’s newest ministry. The Center offers flexible scheduling, accepts State Assistance (W-2) and provides a breakfast, lunch and afternoon snack at no additional charge. At Faith’s Little Friends, our staff is dedicated and focused on curriculum in the classrooms that are fun, clean and most importantly safe.

The teacher’s primary role is to be one of facilitator, planner and designer, not solely the giver of information. Children are encouraged to explore, experience, and actively learn in order to develop a joyful and self-motivating desire to keep growing in every way.

We care for children ages 6 weeks to 12 years, and also operate a before and after school program with bus service to Central-Denison Elementary, Eastview Elementary, and St. Francis Catholic School. Our goal lies in education of the whole child by providing learning opportunities for cognitive, physical, and social-emotional growth. Our mission is to provide quality early childhood care and education in a safe and nurturing environment. We strive to strengthen the bridge between work and family life by creating a special place that supports them both.

Our philosophy is that every child shall be cared for, nurtured, and guided as is needed for that child to grow physically, mentally, and emotionally. The children’s basic needs shall be cared for with TLC and the curriculum shall be presented through the philosophy of learning through play. Rooms are set up with learning centers so that children are able to learn and experiment at their own pace.  Children are allowed to choose activities that interest them and move from center to center as their interests dictate or lead them.

 We believe that it is vital that young children have a rich and nurturing environment in which to spend their days. Our vision to accomplish this:
- A facility that offers warm, safe and engaging areas with adequate space.
- Materials that will stimulate the child's play and development.
- Curriculum that will enrich the child's day and help them to achieve their full potential.
- Quality teachers that are educated and compensated so they can continue to give their best to the children and families they serve.";"http://lakelandslillearners.wix.com/little-learners#!Contact/c24vq";;;;"http://lakelandslillearners.wix.com/little-learners#!blank/c1okx";"http://media.wix.com/ugd/bb90b4_51cc5eedd5424a4e942d5eacbf759c15.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/bb90b4_ccf0c96854f94815b4312d6dc5000d44.jpg_srz_p_702_525_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/bb90b4_cd41c42178af46c5937e60555a39d23f.jpg_srz_p_370_555_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/bb90b4_4bf2ca34ef664dad8b873ef6cc47bf56.jpg_srz_p_441_587_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/bb90b4_7b85702ff035439e90f0bdd4a871666f.jpg_srz_p_370_555_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";;

The campus includes a butterfly garden, wooded area and remnant prairie that serve as outdoor classrooms for our students. Remnants of the original Magee schoolhouse embellish the front foyer to remind all who enter of our rich history. Magee staff honors the principle of old-fashioned school values as we invite parents and community members to visit and engage in children's day-to-day learning. The importance of teaching the whole child is evident in Magee's Mission and Belief Statements. ""The mission of the Magee Community is to inspire students to ""Think, Reflect, Achieve, Create and be Kind.""

At Magee, the positive learning environment works in tandem with strong academic rigor to produce excellence in our students. Their academic performance includes consistently earning some of the state's highest scores on standardized tests. The innovative use of technology through personalized learning opportunities challenges students to advance as readers, writers, problem solvers and thinkers.

The dedicated staff all work together to make Magee worthy of Blue Ribbon status. There is a high level of collegiality among the staff that includes all adults in the building from support staff to classroom teachers to specialists to the principal. Students are the beneficiaries of this common purpose and shared respect, for all in the building are striving for the same purpose. Our purpose is our kids!

As caring professionals, we understand the importance of the early years. We are aware that a child's love for learning will be influenced by the experiences in which they are exposed to in their early years.  With that belief, we commit ourselves to provide stimulating activities and experiences that assist in the developmental process. We incorporate literature, music, dramatic play, and developmentally appropriate activities.
Children have opportunities to play and interact with other children, which helps them build friendships and develop social skills, such as working together and taking turns.
We are very proud of the longevity of our staff - our lead teachers have been with us from 3+ to 20+ years. Many have children who have grown up with the Wee Welcome Inn family!

It is one of 15 elementary schools in the School District of Waukesha. Summit View opened in the fall of 1992. It is a large elementary school that strives to know and enhance each child's unique qualities.

Summit View's physical structure offers students the best of all educational settings. Input into the design of the building was sought from educators, students, parents, and business leaders. There are seven teaching pods which house approximately 650 students in grades kindergarten through fifth. Within each pod there are opportunities for individual as well as small and large group instruction. A teacher planning area, surrounded by a computer area, opens out into four classrooms in each of the pods in grades. Movable walls offer teachers opportunities to vary the learning environment. There are computers located in classrooms, on movable carts, the lab, and in the media center. Other technologies available to students and staff include data projectors, visual presenters, smart boards, Elmo projectors, and digital cameras.

The staff at Summit View embraces a variety of teaching strategies and philosophies. Best practices such as Reader's and Writer's workshop are utilized. Using the district Response to Intervention (R.T.I.) model, interventions occur to provide additional support to students. Students are encouraged to develop independence, be creative and critical thinkers, appreciate and respect individual differences, and become effective problem solvers. We want all of our students to become life-long learners.

Using a Professional Learning Community model, Summit View's staff collaborates to share ideas, analyze data, and plan lessons to help all students succeed. Open communication between home and school is vital. Parent input is one of the keys to the success of students.

We are proud of Summit View and the children who attend it. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to contact the principal, Mr. Peterson.";"http://www.summitviewelementary.com/";;;;"http://www.summitviewelementary.com/documents";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.summitviewelementary.com/_/rsrc/1409093717423/config/customLogo.gif?revision=1";"http://www.summitviewelementary.com/_/rsrc/1409094525027/home/Summit-View.jpg";"http://www.summitviewelementary.com/_/rsrc/1411923071468/photos/SummitView_4462.png";;;;

Corinne graduated from UW- Stout with a degree in Child Development and Family Life. Tracy graduated from UWMadison with a degree in Early Childhood Education. Corinne and Tracy’s desire to own and operate a child care center that would provide high-quality, educational care for children, was developed while working together for other child care providers.

The first All About Learning, located in West Allis, was opened in 1991. It is still in operation today. In 1993, we opened our second center in Oconomowoc. Our third location opened in 1997 in Waukesha. Our fourth location is in Menomonee Falls, located right on Silver Spring. This center opened in the summer of 2000. We opened our Hartland center in October of 2000. In September 2003 we opened our 6th location on Main Street in Menomonee Falls. In June of 2005 we moved our West Allis center to a new location which is on 106th and Lincoln. In summer of 2007 we opened a brand new facility in Oconomowoc, which offers a huge indoor gym, Birthday party and training room. This new building also offers a high tech Hepa filter and UV system designed to collect 99.9% of airborne particles and allergens including dust mites, bacteria and attached viruses. In addition to this, we have installed in house video monitors and recorder in all classrooms for observation and training.

As we are growing, we are continually finding that the need for quality childcare centers is expansive. All About Learning is a growing company dedicated to maintaining quality. We are consistently looking for ways to improve our services through new technology, higher education, and individualized care. Through the growth of this company we have learned to improve our facilities to better meet the needs of the children, families, staff and community. All of our centers operate under the strict guidelines of the National Accreditation Credentials (NAC) program requirements. To learn more about the Accreditation process and requirements visit the NAC website at: www.naccp.org

All About Learning respects the parent’s/guardian’s role and influence in the care of their child/ren. We appreciate any input and information that you can share with us regarding your child and your expectations.";"http://www.aalchildcare.com/locations/menomonee-falls-silverspring.html";;;;"http://www.aalchildcare.com/registration/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.aalchildcare.com/images/west-allis.jpg";"http://www.aalchildcare.com/images/gallery/Cute-multi-cult-pic.jpg";"http://www.aalchildcare.com/images/gallery//ocon-parachute-play.jpg";"http://www.aalchildcare.com/images/gallery/266060_150148828442749_1072623826_o.jpg";;

Federally funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, this early childhood program for income eligible and special needs pre-school children and their families provides comprehensive services in the areas of early childhood education, health, and family and community partnerships. Both center-based and home-based options are available.

Parents are a child’s first teacher and have the longest lasting influence on their lives; therefore, parent involvement is a vital part of the program. Families with children ages three to five are encouraged to apply anytime throughout the year. Families whose children have special needs are also encouraged to apply.

Research shows that Head Start produces long term benefits and significant cost savings by reducing grade retentions, school dropouts, delinquency, substance abuse, and referrals to special education.

CAP Services provides Head Start services in Marquette, Portage, Waupaca, and Waushara counties.";"http://capservices.org/programs/early-childhood-development/head-start/";"https://www.facebook.com/CAPServicesEarlyChildhoodDevelopment";;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://capservices.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CAP-Services-logo1.png";"http://www.capservices.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hs-1.png";"http://www.capservices.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/new_london-1.png";;;;

Children learn through hands on play and structured activities in our well organized classrooms.  We strive to keep a positive and nurturing atmosphere in the classroom.  We continuously work on social development, emphasizing respect, kindness and getting along with others.  We use ""teachable moments"" as opportunities to reinforce the children's academic and social skills.  Our classrooms are organized into ""learning environments.""   These are areas where the children can find toys and materials related by theme, interest, and skills. These activities may be used independently by the children, or with teacher direction, to reinforce and enrich skills and concepts necessary for early childhood development. Learning environments are an excellent way to individualize the curriculum to meet the varying needs of young children.   
Music, dance, art, literature, and play are integrated into our curriculum as well as reading, writing, and math readiness skills.  Social studies and science are also incorporated through our thematic units.  Everything we do is based on the latest research in early childhood development.

The vision for Tiny Green Trees grew from this belief. Together they wanted to find a way to grow environmentally conscious children by connecting them to their natural environment through creative play and exploratory activities.

To manifest this vision, Kelly and her husband Jeremy purchased a dilapidated bar just a block away from their home, gutted it completely and have renovated it into a beautiful, sun-filled center for young children. The backyard has been transformed into a natural playscape. Through their incredible amount of hard work, financial investment and creativity, the community now has a vital resource in Tiny Green Trees, a center serving families who care about their children’s healthy growth and development in relationship to nature and the environment.";"http://www.tinygreentrees.com/contact/";;"7 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday ";;"http://www.tinygreentrees.com/enrollment/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.tinygreentrees.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/puddle-jumping-along-the-trail-e1400695043525.jpg";"http://www.tinygreentrees.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/climbing-vertical-e1398362653727-187x300.jpg";"http://www.tinygreentrees.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Story-time-with-Stephanie-e1393017249488-300x129.jpg";"http://www.tinygreentrees.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/planting-flowers-Owen-w-Katie-300x225.jpg";;

Our school offers a high quality education, dedicated teaching staff and unique learning opportunities to our students, families and community. The MPS Citywide Montessori Council, a leadership group of Montessori teachers and administrators, led this great initiative from the beginning, and the council will continue to support its successful organization.

The Montessori method of education is based on the philosophy that children reach their fullest potential through multi-age interactions in an inquiring, cooperative and encouraging atmosphere. Our staff focuses on fostering competent and responsible students who demonstrate creativity, concentration, coordination and independence in their work. The Montessori environment and teachers ensure that our young learners build confidence in their abilities, feel good about their school experience and develop peaceful relationships with their peers.

Dr. Maria Montessori believed that the work of education is shared between the student, teacher and environment. The curriculum and learning that takes place at Lloyd Barbee Montessori is not the typical teacher to student interaction. Teachers collaborate with children while they learn, creating a communal environment. Students participate in interactive, hands-on learning that leads to high self-esteem and a deep-rooted love for learning. When you observe a Montessori classroom, you will see learning taking place in its purest form – a truly beautiful thing to watch!

Parents and families are central stakeholders at Lloyd Barbee  Montessori School and there are a multitude of opportunities for parent participation that keeps families involved in their child’s education. Young children rely on a strong support system as they develop into confident, responsible elementary scholars. With a variety of events taking place within the school environment throughout the year, families have the opportunity to experience the Lloyd Barbee MPS Montessori atmosphere firsthand and to build a strong connection to their school community.

We also partner with DentaQuest, Uniting Garden Homes and Common Ground.";"http://www5.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/school/barbee/";"https://www.facebook.com/LloydBarbeeMontessori";"Mon - Fri:

Both school boards then passed a resolution that called for a referendum to be placed on the November 2005 ballot to ask the community if they favored consolidation. Over 70% of the voters in Trevor and over 70% of the voters in Wilmot voted for the consolidation. The final Trevor total showed 194 ""Yes"" votes and 78 ""No"" ballots and Wilmot results were 148 ""Yes"" and 51 ""No."" Wisconsin's newest school district, the Trevor-Wilmot Consolidated School District was created on July 1, 2006.

FrontTWSAfter the consolidation in November 2009, the taxpayers approved a million referendum to construct an addition to Trevor Grade School which will enable all the District’s students to be housed on the Trevor site. State Superintendent Tony Evers even called to commend the District for passage of the referendum in a tough economic time. He felt this reflected well on our residents and their commitment to the children. The 65,000 square foot addition will house the primary students, a new gym, computer lab, library, art rooms, and office space.

Contruction of the new addtion began in August 2010 and was completed in August 2011. The school was once again renamed and became Trevor-Wilmot School.

Children must attend all four days.  Head Start promotes school readiness by providing a learning environment that supports children's growth in:
- language and literacy.
- cognition and general knowledge.
- physical development and health.
- social and emotional development.
- approaches to learning.

Head Start emphasizes the role of parents as their child's first and foremost important teacher. The program builds relationships with families that support:
- family well-being and positive parent-child relationships.
- families as learners and lifelong educators.
- family engagement in transitions.
- family connections to peers and community.
- families as advocates and leaders. 

The Head Start program on the Nicolet College Campus operates 32 weeks out of the year that closely coincide with the Fall and Spring semesters at the college. In order to be eligible, families must meet federal low-income guidelines, however, 10 percent of the children enrolled may come from families that are over the federal low-income guidelines. The Head Start program also provides a learning lab setting for students in the Early Childhood Education associate degree program. Head Start does not discriminate against children because of race, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, color, handicap, or disability.

1047881;"KIDS CLUB SUMMER DAYCAMP EVANSVILLE";"420 S 4th St";"Evansville";"WI";53536;"ROCK";6084901233;"http://www.kidsclubinc.net/history.html#";;" “Kid’s Club” began in 1993 as a family childcare site AKA; Country Home Family Daycare in the home of the owner, Lisa Nyman. She provided care for 8 children daily from 7 AM till 5:30 PM Monday – Friday.

Our program first expanded into school age care in 1997 by adding the first “Kid’s Club” Before & after School Program, which was named Footville Before & After School Program and held in the Footville elementary school at 121 Janesville Street in Footville, WI. This program cared for children of the Parkview School District and is still in existence today and is owned & operated by Dawn Wells.

The first Belleville site was added in the fall of 2000 when a survey determined that several children were in need of some type of after school care. “Kid’s Club” After School Program / Elem opened in the Belleville Elementary School at 237 Pearl Street, Belleville, WI on September 1st, 2000. This program cared for children, from both the Intermediate & elementary schools, after school until 5:30 PM nightly, as well as additional school days off. “Kid’s Club” received a $25,000.00 grant to start the program from the Department of Workforce and Development. After an increase in enrolment at this site an additional after school program was added and was called “Kid’s Club” After School Program / Int and opened at the Belleville Intermediate School (in the basement / old art room) at 101 South Grant Street in Belleville, WI in September of 2003. Both after school sites currently care for 20-25 children nightly and are still in operation today.

After several years of providing after school care in Belleville the first summer program began on June 11th, 2004 in the Belleville Jr. High School at 625 West Church Street in Belleville, WI. The “Kid’s Club” Summer Day Camp / Belleville enrolled 8 children the first year, and in 2005 enrollment jumped to 32 children daily, and in 2006 enrollment reached 50 children, where it remains today.

The “Kid’s Club” Summer Day Camp / Evansville opened in the Evansville Intermediate School at 340 Fair Street on June 10th, 2012. The Enrollment during the summer of 2012 was 8 children and since has grown to 20 children for the summer of 2013. This program is still in operation today and cares for school age children during the summer months only.

The most recent expansion for “Kid’s Club” Learning Centers Inc. will take place on May 1st, 2013 when it will open “Kid’s Club” Childcare Center at 420 West Highway 11 in Footville, WI. This expansion was brought about since the recent closure of two group centers in the Footville area which opened up a significant need for this type of center in the Footville area. This site will care for infants – school age children 6 AM-6 PM Monday – Friday. It will be open year round.

The staff of the “Kid’s Club” Learning Centers Inc. are excited about what lies ahead for our program. We offer a structured, educational based program with highly educated teachers. We feel that offering a high quality program will benefit the children in our care and since the YoungStar Program was established in 2010 we have made “quality programming” our main goal!!!";"http://www.kidsclubinc.net/history.html#";;"7 AM till 5:30 PM Monday – Friday";;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";;"http://www.kidsclubinc.net/evansville_pics.html";;;;;

We built our facility  to provide a quality environment for our children.  The facility is constructed using green built practices and materials that are energy efficient; for example we are a geothermal building.  The entire building is heated with in-floor radiant heat, for a cozy feeling.  We provide many windows for natural lighting, use natural colors and have open classrooms.  We have invested in advanced indoor air quality systems to provide a healthier environment.  The rooms are designed to be uncluttered and calming, and encourage exploration.  The philosophy for the building design was to create an environment that does not feel like a school or institution, we want the children to feel at home and comfortable when they are at The Growing Tree.   The building along with our curriculum will facilitate children's natural curiosity to explore and learn. Our interests are not only to provide education but to assist our parents in bringing up the whole child.  Our focuses are developing quality characteristics in our children.  The curriculum and the general way of how we conduct our center will help to teach and model virtues such as perseverance, curiousty, self-control, respect for others as well as themselves, conscientiousness, and optimism.   Our teachers and staff respect our students so that the students can learn to respect themselves.  We encourage and focus on all the positive attributes a child has rather than focus on any negative behaviors.

BUILD A SIMPLE SYSTEM FOR THE FUTURE
Look for the simplest and smartest way to get a result, and then leave a written record of what you have done so others can learn from you.
CONSERVATIVE MINDED
Value the conservative views of our community and be a role model of that mindset.
BE TEACHABLE

BE INNOVATIVE
The Academy is ALWAYS striving to improve. Give your creative ideas freely to help improve the overall employee and customer experience. Always growing!
DELIVER WOW
Give customers of all ages a WOW experience every time through preparation of lesson plans, asking for help when needed, giving prompt and accurate information and creating a safe and caring environment.
DELIVER POSITIVE ENERGY
Bring your positive energy to students, customers and other employees. Answer with more “yes” than “no”, give more compliments than corrections, have more positive suggestions than criticism and show that you value each person.
BE RESPONSIBLE
Take ownership of the work you do and make it your best work. Know when to ask for help. When you make a mistake, go above and beyond to correct it.
BE HONEST
We only make promises we can keep, and we always keep those promises; customer can count on our staff
making recommendations that they really need. We are honest with our customers, even if it means that honesty will cost us money. We act with integrity at all times.
MAKE THE CHANGE HAPPEN

She provided care for 8 children daily from 7 AM till 5:30 PM Monday – Friday.

Our program first expanded into school age care in 1997 by adding the first “Kid’s Club” Before & after School Program, which was named Footville Before & After School Program and held in the Footville elementary school at 121 Janesville Street in Footville, WI. This program cared for children of the Parkview School District and is still in existence today and is owned & operated by Dawn Wells.

The first Belleville site was added in the fall of 2000 when a survey determined that several children were in need of some type of after school care. “Kid’s Club” After School Program / Elem opened in the Belleville Elementary School at 237 Pearl Street, Belleville, WI on September 1st, 2000. This program cared for children, from both the Intermediate & elementary schools, after school until 5:30 PM nightly, as well as additional school days off. “Kid’s Club” received a $25,000.00 grant to start the program from the Department of Workforce and Development. After an increase in enrolment at this site an additional after school program was added and was called “Kid’s Club” After School Program / Int and opened at the Belleville Intermediate School (in the basement / old art room) at 101 South Grant Street in Belleville, WI in September of 2003. Both after school sites currently care for 20-25 children nightly and are still in operation today.

After several years of providing after school care in Belleville the first summer program began on June 11th, 2004 in the Belleville Jr. High School at 625 West Church Street in Belleville, WI. The “Kid’s Club” Summer Day Camp / Belleville enrolled 8 children the first year, and in 2005 enrollment jumped to 32 children daily, and in 2006 enrollment reached 50 children, where it remains today.

The “Kid’s Club” Summer Day Camp / Evansville opened in the Evansville Intermediate School at 340 Fair Street on June 10th, 2012. The Enrollment during the summer of 2012 was 8 children and since has grown to 20 children for the summer of 2013. This program is still in operation today and cares for school age children during the summer months only.

The most recent expansion for “Kid’s Club” Learning Centers Inc. will take place on May 1st, 2013 when it will open “Kid’s Club” Childcare Center at 420 West Highway 11 in Footville, WI. This expansion was brought about since the recent closure of two group centers in the Footville area which opened up a significant need for this type of center in the Footville area. This site will care for infants – school age children 6 AM-6 PM Monday – Friday. It will be open year round.

The staff of the “Kid’s Club” Learning Centers Inc. are excited about what lies ahead for our program. We offer a structured, educational based program with highly educated teachers. We feel that offering a high quality program will benefit the children in our care and since the YoungStar Program was established in 2010 we have made “quality programming” our main goal!!!";"http://www.kidsclubinc.net/history.html";;"7 AM till 5:30 PM Monday – Friday";;"http://www.kidsclubinc.net/forms.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.kidsclubinc.net/history.html";;;;;;

We know that there are a lot of other childcare centers here in the greater Milwaukee area but we want to thank you for choosing us to love, care, educate and nurture your child!
Now we would like to take the time to tell you a little about us.  We have been in business since February 2008.  Our first location was located at76th/Becher.  We out grew the center and relocated to 1627 S. 44 Street in July of 2011.  We also have (2) other locations at 3343 North 35th Street and our newest location at 7330 West Lincoln Avenue that is currently open and accepting enrollment.  The centers are owned and operated by Tangie Cokes with the support of her husband Michael Cokes.
 
We believe that a child's first school experience is vitally important in shaping a child's approach and attitude toward learning.  At Tangie's Just Like Mommy Childcare Center LLC, each child will have the opportunity to be a child.  Each child will have the chance to gain self-esteem, confidence, independence and self-discipline at his/her own individual pace.  Our program has been established to provide a safe, stable and nurturing environment with an academically appropriate education curriculum that prepares them to be successful! 
 
Our professional and caring staff will provide your child with an atmosphere where each individual will know they are special and loved.  We see each child as a unique individual therefore by respecting and responding to each individual needs.  Teachers create a developmentally appropriate learning environment that addresses the needs of your child at each developmental stage. 
 
We teach according to the belief that children are active learner, and learn best through play and hands on opportunities.  Your child will be encouraged to play, discover participate, inquire, experiment,and interact with others.  Families come to us for many reasons, but largely because they recognize that, we will treat their child, just like mommy!

Centerpiece utilizes Applied Behavioral Analysis, which is a science that develops methods of changing behavior.  In the most basic terms, ABA therapy seeks to change behaviors by extinguishing undesirable behaviors and reinforcing the good behaviors. 

Centerpiece LLC offers clients a unique opportunity to excel and progress through:

    One on one individual teaching time with highly trained and experienced therapists
    Facilitated group activities within the center that allow children the opportunity to immediately practice the skills and behaviors mastered in one on one sessions and interact with their peers.
    Access to therapy tools, toys, and equipment that may not be available to children who receive therapy in home.
    Direct and immediate access to senior level staff and center director when problem behaviors or questions arise.
    Emphasis on providing a wide array of therapy activities to all clients including gross and fine motor activities, structured and unstructured play opportunities, and equipment and activities designed to meet the sensory needs of clients of all ages.

The staff at Centerpiece uses an eclectic approach to therapy, bringing a wide range of ideas, styles and strategies together and harnessing these approaches into a consistent and measurable ABA program.  Centerpiece believes that the child should be at the center of everything we do, not the program!  Our staff have an emphasis on respecting a family's right to choose other complementary therapies (HBOT, special diets, craniosacral, neurofeedback, etc) because we believe that no one therapy or treatment is the answer and it takes an entire toolbox of approaches to get the best results for a child and to change with the child over the years as they grow and progress.
