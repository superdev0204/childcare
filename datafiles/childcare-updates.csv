Parents are respected as the primary educators and nurturers of their children and are encouraged to be actively involved in their child’s education and growth.

South Dakota Head Start programs are federally funded with no State funds appropriated for support. Programs are monitored intensively to assure quality and adherence to provisions of the Head Start Act. 20% of the total funding for Head Start programs must come from the community. 90% of children enrolled in Head Start must meet Federal Poverty guidelines. 10% of enrollment must be available to children with disabilities.

The dollar investment in Head Start programs has a high rate of return. For each dollar invested in Head Start, there is an economic gain of $7-$10. Some research suggests it could be as much as $17. This is realized in reduced expenses of grade retention, special education services, and a higher earning potential and economic success in adulthood, thus reducing dollars needed for welfare and the criminal justice system.

The educational philosophy of Koch Elementary School reflects the overall educational philosophy of the Milbank School District 25-4. That philosophy states: 
The Board believes that education should be shaped by purposes rather than forces. 
Therefore, the education system of this district, while maintaining flexibility in adapting to an ever-changing society, will be dedicated to the personal development of each student to the full potential of his/her abilities and interests in a sequentially coordinated curriculum which allows for individual differences. 
To this end, staff members will strive to aid in each student's intellectual, physical, moral, emotional, aesthetic, and social growth so that he or she may become a useful and responsible member of home, community, and society while leading a personally rewarding life. 
The board believes that the ultimate goal of an education in the district schools should be to prepare the students for a world of rapid change and unforeseeable demands. 
The Koch Elementary School staff believes in the development of each individual child to their fullest potential. To accomplish this, we realize that close communication must be 
maintained between the student, home, and school. We also realize that individual programs may need to be developed to meet the needs of certain students. 
Discipline is also a major component of a good school. The discipline at Koch Elementary School is directed toward providing each student with firm guidelines where they can l
earn to accept personal responsibility for their actions and decisions. 
It is also the goal of the Koch Elementary School staff to treat each student in a personal, humanistic manner, addressing the self-worth of each individual student. We believe that positive interaction with students and parents is the only way to provide the best possible education for each individual student";"http://www.milbankschooldistrict.com/schools/koch/index.php";;;"http://www.milbankschooldistrict.com/schools/districtinfo/employment.php";;"http://www.milbankschooldistrict.com/schools/koch/handbook.php";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.milbankschooldistrict.com/images/milbank_bulldogs.png";;;;;;

From 1973 through 1984 the Boys & Girls Club served its purpose of keeping kids busy and out of trouble at its downtown location. Then in 1984, the Board of Directors raised $526,000 in order to construct a new facility adjacent to the high school and indoor swimming pool. This facility not only housed the Boys & Girls Club, but also included a fitness facility operated by the City.  For ten years the new facility was large enough. But as community needs increased, the usage of the Boys & Girls Club grew from 101 youth per day in 1993 to over 133 per day in 1997. This growth coupled with a need for a place for teens to gather was the driving force for the expansion that was completed in 1998. The $1.8 million expansion included a teen center, gymnasium, youth locker rooms, running track, offices and an early childhood develop area.

Not only has the Boys & Girls Club grown on-site, but also in the number of sites programs are offered at as well. The Boys & Girls Club administers programs in each of the elementary schools during the school year, as well as a summer program at one elementary school.  This program is called Kidscope.  Many parents enjoy the convenience of having services in their neighborhood.

Arrow Prep began at the main facility at the start of the 2001 school year to provide a program for 4 through 6 year olds. This program allowed the facility to be utilized while school age youth are in school during the day.

2013 marked 40 years of service to the youth in our community and continued organizational growth. Because of numerous partnerships with local, state and federal entities, we are proud to provide quality child care programs, early childhood development programs, youth development programs and teenage programming to youth in seven different locations across the Watertown community.

N.";"HURON";"SD";57350;"BEADLE";"(605) 352-7737";"http://jvcs.org/";;"James Valley Christian recognizes the extraordinary gift that God has given to you, your children, and we offer something priceless in return: an education where Christ-likeness is modeled in every area; from academics to fine arts to athletic competitions.

For over 5 decades James Valley Christian School has been training students. After several years of prayer, research and planning, the school doors opened in 1957 with a completely accredited, corporately sponsored, board run Christian school. In 1979, 7th & 8th grades were added, two years later we expanded to grades K-6th and in 2000, after a move into Huron a preschool was added.

Each teacher at James Valley is a committed Christian who desires to see the children grow in their personal walk with Jesus Christ. Teachers start every morning with prayer and lead devotions in their respective classrooms. Chapel is held weekly and challenges students to be extraordinary in how they act, think, and live.

The goal of James Valley Christian School is to endeavor to lead each student to a voluntary commitment of his or her life to the Lordship of Christ; to develop each student’s God-given spiritual, physical, mental, social and artistic gifts to their fullest potential; and to lead each student to a spiritual maturity that glorifies God.

Academically, James Valley Christian school offers a challenging curriculum that prepares students to enter colleges and universities with confidence and the ability to excel. Science is taught from a Christian worldview while helping students understand and refute the modern science that they will encounter when they study at secular institutions. It provides them with a strong basis for their faith as well, understanding God’s creation and how it was intricately designed.

Math and English are advanced and stretch young minds to reach for their potential. While teachers desire to challenge their students, they are also available to encourage and help beyond their required work hours.

James Valley Christian School has a strong arts program. From music to theater to public speaking, students have opportunities to grow, learn and develop their artistic abilities. Kindergarten to 12th graders are involved in concerts, oral interp, contests and ministry programs. Excellence is strived for and reached at both local and state competitions.

Overall, James Valley Christian School is where you want to be! Why not consider sending your child to a place that will reinforce your Christian values and challenge your child to be the very best that they can be? Call us today and schedule a visit!

First Adventure opened in 2010 at our Benson Road Location on the Northwest part of Sioux Falls.  Jessie Holte had been running her own in-home daycare for five years prior to that, before expanding into the center.  With the experience as an in-home provider, the owners are able to take steps to assure a small, family oriented facility.  Our classrooms are divided at the many stages of development, not just their age, so that we can have a focused and nurturing classroom feel.

Both of our centers offer a large indoor gym that is separate from the classrooms to offer a place that the children can play and interact in with balls, toys, and games.  With the weather not always cooperating, they still have a place to enjoy and get out of the classrooms.  We also have a large outdoor playground that each age group take turns using throughout the day.  It is very important to give the children space that they can run around and be kids.

Learning Center was not just something that we put in our name.  Our focus on learning and development starts in our infant rooms with each classroom required to have a weekly newsletter updated to state what areas of fine motor skills, sensory activities, arts and crafts, music, and literacy they are going to be working on.  Our staff loves to incorporate fun ways to get each age group involved in these.  Our Preschool Curriculum is ""Handwriting Without Tears,"" which is used in many of the area Elementary Schools, including Sioux Falls and Harrisburg School Districts.  We felt it would be great to have children already familiar with the basic skills and techniques, that they will need once they begin Kindergarten. 

Our gyms are also used for meals, including breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snacks.  The meals are included in our weekly prices for care.  Each location has its own Full-time Cook!  Each month they create a menu, and are encouraged to have new meals added each month.  We follow the state and federal guidelines for healthy and nutritious meals, while going the extra step to make sure the children like what they eat and are getting enough to be full and satisfied.

The staff at First Adventure Learning Center are required to go through an extensive background check including state and federal criminal history, and the sex offender registry.  Everyone must go through CPR and First Aid courses, and maintain a yearly certificate.  We also have a long orientation and training process to make sure they not only know what to do in the case of emergencies, but know how to keep a classroom organzied, properly sanitize toys and surfaces, fun ways to interact and teach the children, and communicate with parents.

First Adventure Learning Center is owned by Jessie and Ryan Holte.  We have two beautiful daughters of our own; Taylor, who attends Endeavor Elementary; and Hadley, who is in our Pre-Kindergarten class at the center.  If you are considering First Adventure Learning Center for your child, or already bring them to us, we would like to thank you for the opportunity to care for them.  We do not take that lightly.

God's Word is the foundation of learning, a core value of Christian Center Elementary School in Sioux Falls for more than 30 years.

Since its founding in 1980 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Christian Center Elementary School has been helping students excel in reading, writing and arithmetic while they learn the importance of respect, kindness and integrity taught in God's Word.

We are the only LOCKED facility in Vermillion, and the only facility that prepares and serves fresh, home made food with a full-time cook on staff! The Center also recently upgraded it’s security system to include cameras around the perimeter of the property and at the front desk. These additional security measures allows the Center to continue it’s mission of a secure and safe learning environment!

The Center for Children and Families is a non profit childcare and preschool facility.  The Center began as a joint venture pairing the non profit Vermillion Daycare with the for profit facility Little Yotes.  The merger took place in 2001 when the Center for Children and Families opened in August of that year.  The Center has been providing high quality child centered education since it’s inception and continues their mission with the USD Head Start program in a preschool and early Head Start partnership. 

The Center for Children and Families provides services for infants 4 weeks to 12 months of age in our Caterpillar Room.  The Butterfly room is home to our 12 month to 23 1/2 month old mobile infants.  Our toddler rooms cares for our little ones ages 2-3 years of age.  Finally, our preschool program is home to our 3-5 year old kiddos.  The Center for Children and Families also offers before and after school care for school age children 5-10 years of age.  We have a bus stop located next door to the Center.

The goal of the Center for Children and Families is to provide excellent care to all children while helping to stimulate their social, physical, emotional, and cognitive skills.  We strive to make the environment fun and educational: an environment which allows children many opportunities to grow and learn.  The Center believes that the family network is the foundation from which all children learn to love and grow.  We strive to implement family values throughout our daily activities.";"https://centerforchildren.wordpress.com/about/";;;;"https://centerforchildren.wordpress.com/85-2/";"https://centerforchildren.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/center-for-children-and-families-parent-handbook-9-30-2014.pdf";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

From 1973 through 1984 the Boys & Girls Club served its purpose of keeping kids busy and out of trouble at its downtown location. Then in 1984, the Board of Directors raised $526,000 in order to construct a new facility adjacent to the high school and indoor swimming pool. This facility not only housed the Boys & Girls Club, but also included a fitness facility operated by the City.  For ten years the new facility was large enough. But as community needs increased, the usage of the Boys & Girls Club grew from 101 youth per day in 1993 to over 133 per day in 1997. This growth coupled with a need for a place for teens to gather was the driving force for the expansion that was completed in 1998. The $1.8 million expansion included a teen center, gymnasium, youth locker rooms, running track, offices and an early childhood develop area.

Not only has the Boys & Girls Club grown on-site, but also in the number of sites programs are offered at as well. The Boys & Girls Club administers programs in each of the elementary schools during the school year, as well as a summer program at one elementary school.  This program is called Kidscope.  Many parents enjoy the convenience of having services in their neighborhood.

Arrow Prep began at the main facility at the start of the 2001 school year to provide a program for 4 through 6 year olds. This program allowed the facility to be utilized while school age youth are in school during the day.

2013 marked 40 years of service to the youth in our community and continued organizational growth. Because of numerous partnerships with local, state and federal entities, we are proud to provide quality child care programs, early childhood development programs, youth development programs and teenage programming to youth in seven different locations across the Watertown community.

She has educated and nurtured children at all levels in Elementary schools both in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and in the British Virgin Island of Tortola. In 1996, she migrated to the United States and two years later -- in the summer of 1998 -- she joined the Friends of Crown Heights family as a Group teacher’s aide in our 671 Prospect Place facility. In October of that year, she was promoted to the position of Assistant Teacher at our former Rogers Avenue facility.  And it was there, she says, “while working alongside the talented and knowledgeable Group Teacher Ms. Virginia Somera, and under the caring and professional leadership of the then-director Mr. Daryl Davis,” that she developed her insatiable passion for Early Childhood Education.

Buoyed by the collegial support and encouragement of her peers, Ms. Nichols set off for Brooklyn College in the fall of the year 2000, graduating three years later with the Bachelor of Arts Degree in Early Childhood Education with an additional concentration in Political Science. She also obtained the New York State Department of Education Provisional Certificate for Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten and Grades 1 through 6. These accomplishments earned her a promotion to the position of Group Teacher in a Pre-Kindergarten Classroom.

Ms. Nichols continued her educational quest by enrolling in the graduate program at Brooklyn College, from which she later graduated with the Master of Science degree in Education. She now holds the New York State Department of Education Permanent Certificate for Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten, and Grades 1 through 6, as well as an Initial Certificate and a Professional Certificate for Birth to Grade 2. Further, Ms. Nichols has been initiated as a member of the Eta Theta Chapter of Kappa Delta Pi, the International Honor Society in Education which encourages the highest professional, intellectual and personal standards of its members and recognizes outstanding contributions in the field of education.

Ms. Nichols shares the view famously articulated by the noted developmental psychologist and educational philosopher Jean Piaget who said, “The primary goal of education is to create people who are capable of doing new things, not simply of repeating what other generations have done----- people who are creative, inventive, and discoverers.”

When not on the job constantly seeking new ways to improve her center, Ms. Nichols goes home to her husband, three sons, daughter-in-law and her granddaughter.

There are many aspects of this center that sets it apart from all of the rest. CosmoKidz is a brand new facility with eco-friendly environment, spacious classrooms, and a safe private enclosed outdoor playground.  We believe that our teachers are our students' role models.​

​        As concluded by Piaget, caregivers can encourage problem-solving and can promote creativity ""by making problem-solving opportunities available with a wide variety of materials, by encouraging infants and toddlers to experiment with solutions, by not jumping in too quickly to solve problems for them, and by helping them notice the results of their experiments.""  Here at CosmoKidz the curriculum is developed with this psychology in mind, so that in the classroom the theory is in motion.

         Each day consists of circle time where children and teachers get together to discuss the days events, read stories and discuss stories, be entertained by puppet shows and also learn and sing new songs!  Another important aspect of the day is center time; this is where your child will work on his/her sensory-motor, social, language, and problem solving skills. We offer several different learning centers such as: arts and crafts, blocks, dramatic play, language, mathematics, and science.

         We believe in creating a nurturing and welcoming environment for our young scholars in our efforts to provide a culture for learning. Children are supported by their teacher through positive reinforcement and learning is an on-going experience through a child's social interactions with his or her classmates to praises from a teacher for doing great work during arts and crafts. Throughout your youngster's journey through early childhood, teachers will support your child's growth in persistence and taking initiative as well as inspire your youngster with creative and engaging planned play and curriculum.";"http://www.cosmokidzpreschool.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/CosmokidzPreschool/info?tab=page_info";"Mon-Fri:

That’s why your child’s days here at Rainbow will always start with warm hellos and end with loving goodbyes.

The early years of your child’s life are a time of tremendous development and learning. Our curriculum are specifically designed to cultivate children’s independent thinking, encourage their curiosity to learn, and support their physical development.

Here, at Rainbow, we believe in child-centered pedagogy or student-centered learning. Our program focuses on the children’s needs, abilities, interests and learning styles with the teacher as a facilitator of learning. We also strongly believe that young children learn best when they are provided with meaningful instructional experiences that build upon and connect with previous experiences in their everyday life. Hence, by relating math, science, social studies, and art experience to a child’s everyday life, the child will find the information much more interesting and stimulating. We strongly believe that a daily schedule of self-exploration and academic learning will help your child excel in the challenging world that she will face tomorrow.

We are thrilled to have state-of-the-art centers in the culturally-diverse borough of Queens, NY, and we take pride in our bilingual educational programs. All of the children at our Flushing location are exposed to both English and Chinese instruction throughout the day. At our new Fresh Meadows location, we are also offering free Chinese and Spanish lessons in our programs. You will be surprised at how much your child will learn!

It is an important decision that you are making today, please give us an opportunity to make a difference in your child’s life! Please call us today to schedule a free tour.

Ready to have some fun!

This year we have a new site opening at the Texas Leadership Charter Academy. We are fortunate to have partnerships with local organizations to bring the excitement to YOU through Enrichment Programming which brings unique adventures to the After School Care site for expository learning experiences! This grants our students participation in programs in which they may not otherwise have access to. We have also revamped our Character Building Curriculum. Its goal is to enhance the children’s inter and intra-personal awareness while educating them in the areas of Generosity, Perseverance, Gratitude, Respect, Compassion, Self-Control, Responsibility, and Patriotism. We are committed to providing a positive, nurturing after-school experience at a reasonable price – After School Care is $140 per month, or less than $8 per day!

Startup funding for EAC was provided by the Urban Council. Volunteers joined forces as board members, fundraisers, and unpaid staff to assist in Extend-A-Care’s development.  Demand for geographic expansion became so great during the late 80s to early 90s that EAC spread to more sites in two years than it had in the previous ten.

Extend-A-Care’s primary objectives are to enhance the cognitive, social, and physical development of our children, to assist working families in becoming self-supporting, and to reduce the number of Central Texas children who fall victim to or commit crimes due to inadequate adult supervision.  This year, over 3,500 children will participate in our school-year program and 900 in our summer program, forging positive and meaningful relationships with peers and adult role models as they engage in activities that boost self-esteem, promote physical fitness, and support academic development.";"http://www.eackids.org/locations/preschool/anderson-high-infant-and-preschool";"https://www.facebook.com/ExtendACareATX/info/?tab=page_info";;"http://www.eackids.org/careers";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.eackids.org/public/images/logos/eac-logo-white.png";;;;;;

Through their extensive history with the Montessori business they were able to not only serve as owners, but as guides and teachers as well. They had one overlying goal: to create a school with qualified staff and a curriculum that created a strong foundation for the child. To achieve this, they utilized their prior knowledge and experiences to create an environment that kept students, teachers, and parents happy. They stayed on school grounds everyday, hoping to be equally involved in creating strong relationships with the students and parents.

It’s multi-generational and stretches back over a century and a half, long before there was a Buda or Kyle, and when the more well-known communities in the area were known by names like Science Hall, Mountain City and Elm Grove. Many stories surround the family that gave its name to Carpenter Hill but, for the sake of clarity, consider the family’s first three generations, the time line stretching from a pre-Civil War arrival here to the 1970s.

Among the earliest settlers in the area west of today’s Buda was W.H.H. Carpenter, who in 1855 bought the property that, because of the family’s occupation on the high ground, came to be known as Carpenter Hill. Indians still roamed this area when the Carpenters settled. It’s situated within a few stones’ throws of where Carpenter Hill Elementary students attend school today. Carpenter had taught earlier in his life and neighboring settlers briefly employed him at what was known as the Kellyville School one mile north of Buda.

Most prominent among the second generation of the family here was W.H.H. Carpenter’s son, Cyrus Milton Carpenter. Twenty years of age as the Civil War broke out, he was among the many Hays County boys who volunteered for the Confederacy. He was turned down for service, the result of a medical physical, and ended up serving as a Methodist circuit preacher and, later, a local minister in the Buda area. He also published The Buda Star in the early 1900s.

It does no justice to this pioneer family to abbreviate their stories, but it was a locally-born son of Cyrus, Fred, whose third generation contributions permanently reinforced family heritage. He was born just after Buda (nee Dupre) and Kyle were founded and he lived into the 1970s to be a family and community icon.

Born in his family’s still-standing log cabin, Fred was a life-long cowboy and epitomized everything that profession represents. He was what historian Mary Giberson called “an impressive presence.” She called him “a pleasant, handsome, gentle, strong and vibrant man—good humored, witty, and an entertaining person with a strong sense of community spirit who remembered past events and loved to spread his stories of Buda to others.” A graduate of the one-time Elm Grove School, Fred Carpenter’s favorite place to spin stories of Buda’s past was on the bench in front of Cecil Clark’s grocery store (today’s Raby’s Roots).

As with ancestors, Fred Carpenter’s life represented much more than told here, but it was in his name that his family members and others most fervently presented their case for the school’s naming. Many family members were at the dedication and today’s Carpenter Hill Elementary family now has a heightened appreciation for the heritage they share.

By Kindergarten, children have a solid grasp of the concepts they need to be successful learners in the classroom. All activities are differentiated to meet every child's individual needs.

Beginning in Junior Pre-K (3 year olds), children are exposed to numbers, letters, shapes and colors, with the understanding that they will not be expected to master these concepts.  Children at this age do not understand that shapes, letters and numbers are symbols that we use to communicate.  However, exposing children to these concepts builds up their background knowledge and sets the foundation for future learning.

The following year, in Pre-K (4 year olds), more time is spent on these concepts, as children at this age begin to understand that letters and words are symbols that we can use to communicate ideas.  They understand that shapes and colors can be used to create things.  They are also ready to begin using pencils and crayons to write letters and numbers, as their fine motor skills are more developed than their predecessors in Junior Pre-K.  We begin to show children how to write numbers and letters, and provide them ample opportunities to practice with them using a variety of mediums: crayons, markers, colored pencils, magnetic letters, paints, stamps, books, etc.

By Kindergarten (5 year old), children are able to synthesize what they have learned in the years prior and are ready to use these numbers and letters at a higher level, understanding how they use these numbers and letters to communicate.   In Kindergarten, our focus becomes on teaching children how to read and write by combining these numbers and letters that they have learned.  We teach children how to add and subtract using real life objects.  We provide them with opportunities to use these skills in real life situations: post office, restaurant, bakery, grocery store.";"http://greatergrace4u.com/grace-academy/";;"6:30am-6:30pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://greatergrace4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/grace-academy.jpg";;;;;;

Physical activity in toddlers and preschoolers brings physical benefits such as increased muscle strength, coordination and bone density. Along with obvious exercise benefits, these activities can boost physical well being later in life by reducing the risk of injury and diseases like osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease - so it's important to encourage your toddler into active play early.

Not only that, the confidence that active play teaches in gross motor movements leaves toddlers free to enjoy, and challenge themselves in physical activity both now and long into adulthood.

Guidelines from the National Association for Sport and Activity suggest toddlers and preschoolers should engage in at least two hours of physical activity and active play every day.

Happy Tyro’s Toddler Fun Center helps you achieve this in a fun, safe, friendly, environment.

Stay for an hour or two and your little one will be tuckered out and ready for bedtime.

Only pass holders are permitted on the premises, to become a pass holder just come on in. You can purchase an all day pass or a 20 day pass.";"http://www.happytyros.com/";;"06:00am - 6:00pm Monday-Friday ";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.happytyros.com/uploads/3/4/4/3/3443173/1418735363.png";;;;;;

Heritage is where children come to learn, play and socialize. All children at Heritage are given the opportunity to explore, experiment and create in a safe and nurturing environment.

 

Heritage was opened with the idea that a preschool could be a second home for kids. Hugs are just as important as the ABCs here.

 

At Heritage, we offer a well-rounded educational program in a warm and happy environment. Our teachers are educated and well trained to work with young children. Our staff work very closely as a team because they have passion about working with children.

 

We provide a family type environment where all the children know all the staff and all the staff know all the children. This makes the transition from class to class run smoothly and makes your child feel very much at home.

 

Small classes with low teacher/child ratios, experienced staff and a superior program based on helping each child develop as an individual are just the beginning. More importantly, everyone at Heritage loves what they do!

Children are our passion! During this time we have studied child development in great depth.  We have learned that no two children are the same.  Each child is a unique individual and each child has their own unique learning style, therefore it is imperative not to try to fit children all into the same mold by teaching only one curriculum or method. Our focus is on helping each child develop to his/her full potential through a healthy, balanced, mixture of educational, and recreational activities.

 

We use a combination of curriculums and teaching methods to ensure each child developes to his/her fullest potential. 

 

We begin by teaching our babies Infant Sign Language and the ""Your Baby Can Read Program.""  We use the High Reach Learning Curriculum along with some Montessori Methods.  We teach English and Spanish to all of our children.

 

Together, we can prepare your child for the wonderful life that lies ahead!

 

If you are looking for QUALITY child care at an AFFORDABLE price, look no further! When it comes to your kids, nothing less than the highest standard will do.  We pride ourselves on our unique home style comfortable atmosphere partnered with a school-type environment giving our children the best of both worlds.

 

Our children feel at home as soon as soon as they enter our school and discover our beautiful 60 gallon fish aquarium filled with colorful fish.

The creative academic approach taken by each Ivy Montessori Academy is a true Montessori curriculum integrated with the Reggio Emilia Project approach and additional instruction in Spanish, Technology, Music, Art, Yoga and so much more. This is how we deliver traditional Montessori instruction that has been modernized and prepares today's students for tomorrow's challenges.

Our facilities include an outdoor classroom for environmental studies, science experiments or creative/splash play art projects. When it is warm enough we also have structured splash play outside. We also offer an exciting program during the summer months for children of all ages!

Early Education should be fun and educational, and that's what you will find at Ivy Montessori Academy.

We accept children starting at 6 weeks and immediately begin our work to prepare every child academically, socially and emotionally for elementary school and a lifetime love of learning.

Every child enrolled in our schools receives morning and afternoon snacks as well as lunch prepared on-site to strict nutritional guidelines. The health and safety of each child is our primary concern.

Currently we have 4 schools: Coppell, North Dallas/Plano, Garland/Fire-wheel and Irving/Valley Ranch. We have limited spaces available at each school and as always, we are constantly on the look out for teaching talent.

All our schools open at either 6:30am or 7:00am and all close at 6:30pm. For confirmation of the hours of the school you are interested in, please call us.

Miller Elementary opened as a school within a school for the 2015-16 school term. Students and staff will share space with Glenn Harmon Elementary (2015-16) and Charlotte Anderson Elementary (2016-17) while their facilities are being rebuilt. Miller Elementary is scheduled to open as its own independent campus the fall of 2017.

MISD Administration put the school-within-a-school initiative in place as an effort to prevent overcrowding at the neighboring campuses of Elizabeth Smith and Cora Spencer Elementary.  As these campuses reach capacity, student overflow could be moved to Judy K. Miller Elementary.

In April 2015, Mansfield ISD opened up a limited number of enrollment spots for students zoned at Smith and Spencer Elementary. This option allowed parents, in close proximity of Miller Elementary, an opportunity to pre-enroll their child at the school they would most likely be zoned to when Judy K. Miller opens as an independent campus. Parent meetings were held at both campuses to discuss details about the intra-district option.";"http://www.mansfieldisd.org/page.cfm?p=5805&newsid=286";;"7:30 A.M. - 3:30 P.M";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.mansfieldisd.org/uploaded/elementary/judy_miller/images/judyk_logo.png";;;;;;

Celeste Barretto serves the school’s community, including over 840 students, as the School Leader.

KIPP Dream’s Mission Statement follows, developed by the faculty and staff:  “We will do whatever it takes to provide our students with a world class education that develops the knowledge, character, and critical thinking skills necessary to excel physically, academically, and socially, on their journey to and through college and in the competitive world beyond.”

At KIPP Dream, teachers and staff include KIPP alumni, native Houstonians, musicians, artists, actors, poets, readers, writers, singers, KIPP parents, native speakers of Spanish and Vietnamese, and loving members of the community. Big Dreamsters play to their strengths, holding students and staff to world-class standards in order to keep our promise of to and through college for every single little KIPPster. 

KIPP Dream serves over 840 students in grades Pre-K3 through 4th grade.  We execute upon aligned curriculum and standards, character education based in the work of Martin Seligman, and create socially intelligent, independent, critically thinking students.  KIPP Dream offers world-class and up-to-date instruction in Language Arts (Literacy), Writing, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Spanish-language and Culture, Health, Wellness & Physical Education, Dance, Visual Arts, Music and Innovation.  Students have the opportunity to choose electives, named IGNITE classes for our values, later in school year.  Every student has the opportunity to learn their passions and strengths at KIPP Dream, while also using grit and tenacity to develop their areas for growth.

Enrichment programming currently includes our almost-famous IGNITE Dance Team, our accomplished Math Club, our Saturday Reading Fluency Boot Camp, and our extended day programming (3I – Intensive Intervention Implementation Program).  Not only do we provide training and instruction to students, administrators, and teachers; at KIPP Dream, families come together 3 Saturdays per year at Parent Workshops, to learn techniques to assist their students on the journey to and through college. Families, teachers, and staff all work closely together toward college-readiness.  We look forward to adding sports (especially soccer!) and partnering with Waterworks Aquatics for swim lessons in the near future.

Students at KIPP Dream have an incredible daily experience, they interact with technology, engage in small group instruction, workstations, language and sophisticated vocabulary development, Family Fun Nights, daily recess, weekly Team & Family meetings & award ceremonies, and achieve recognition for their achievements in academics, character, attendance, and performance. 

KIPP Dream works closely with the Neuhaus Education Center, Region 4, and other high quality local training centers to provide teachers with world-class training.  Our talented faculty and staff works tirelessly every day to ensure that every single Dreamster not only achieves their greatest potential academically, but that each is instilled with our IGNITE values:  Integrity, Give, Never Give Up, Imagine, Trust, Explore.";"http://kipphouston.org/dream";"https://www.facebook.com/KIPPhouston/";;"http://kipphouston.org/careers";"http://kipphouston.org/lottery";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://kipphouston.org/sites/default/files/KIPP-Dream-Header-General-Page.jpg";;;;;;

Our highly trained teachers use the most current, research-based methods to deliver learning in a manner that is most appropriate to the child’s developmental age and stage.

Our philosophy is rooted in widely accepted early-childhood research that indicates the deepest, most effective learning is ingrained through play-based learning. Our strong academic curriculum supports free and structured learning in both the group, and individual setting, by providing a cognitive, physical, social, and emotional framework to play-based learning.  Play is an essential part of childhood. It offers the freedom children need to explore their surroundings, develop new ideas and concepts, and build a sense of competence, autonomy, and a positive self-concept.   Play based learning allows children to apply what they have learned to different situations, and practice decision making in each scenario.

We believe children learn how to form positive, caring, cooperative relationships by interacting with children and adults. Our low teacher-to-student ratio facilitates such interactions in a safe, secure, and nurturing environment.  Through these interactions, children build valuable social and emotional skills, and learn to get along with others.

We view our children and families as our partners.  We believe open and honest communication builds a partnership that ensures the full needs of a child are met.  We also recognize parents as the most important adults in the lives of their children. It is, therefore, our goal is to involve our parents and families in creating a successful learning experience for each child, and assist in the task of providing a strong foundation for their child’s future development.";"http://learningmindsacademy.com/";;"Monday to Friday

Sound familiar? What if you found out the working mom stumbled upon a way to stop rushing and start spending more quality time with her family? Would you be interested in knowing how she did it?

She enrolled her kids in After-School Taekwondo program at Martial Arts America in Lake Jackson. Designed for kids ages 5-14, After-school Taekwondo was developed to ease your after-school load by…

1. Picking up your kids from school…in properly insured vans. 

2. Satisfying their need for an after-school activity…daily Taekwondo classes will reduce their excess after-school energy AND teach them skills such as teamwork, leadership, better focus and concentration. 

3. Day and week camps when school is out for holidays.

We know that young children are active learners; therefore, we encourage each child to discover the world through hands-on, interactive learning and the richness of open-ended, purposeful play.  This creates a solid foundation for a child’s formal education and a love of learning in the years to come.

In an atmosphere of love and acceptance children develop positive self-esteem and confidence in their place in the group.  Families are supported by our philosophy of sharing God's love, resulting in a community where we work together to create a wonderful place for children to thrive.

We believe that well planned classroom environments are paramount to the success of a child’s growth and development.   In order to meet the unique needs and interests of the children we teach, our curriculum is designed by our own staff with a balanced focus on spiritual development, readiness skills, pre-writing skills, motor skills, social skills, cognitive development, and self-help skills.

Activities are designed to be age-appropriate and developmentally challenging. Our day consists of both teacher-guided and child-initiated indoor and outdoor activities. While at school your child will have the opportunity to build relationships and develop appropriate academic and problem-solving skills.

We incorporate ideas from the Reggio Emilia, Jean Piaget, Montessori, and Waldorf philosophies about basic early childhood development learning in our activities.

Our school believes in the holistic development of children. Therefore, the school curriculum provides wide array of activities with focus on nature, science, environment, music, art, computers, and physical education. We facilitate such learning through hands-on exploration, experimentation, crafts, music, and outdoor activities. Our setting inspires curiosity, wonder, and creativity. By providing an open environment with wide array of experiences to young children, we hope to foster a life-long relationship with nature.

We provide an environment in which children cherish time spent at school. Our educational materials are multisensory and our kids follow natural path to reading, writing and problem solving.  Our compassionate, well-trained, equipped, and motivated staff is prepared to help the children grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially.

Our classes are held in a variety of nature-oriented settings, both inside and outside. Our outdoor environment is carefully prepared for kids to explore their surroundings under the watchful eyes of adult supervision. We introduce children to a variety of art, science, math, and language theme surroundings to promote focused learning.

Our children enjoy eating their lunches outdoors, like many of us dream doing each day as we sit in our offices. For us at Nature School, nature play is important aspect of our daily routine. New findings indicate that children who regularly play and spend time in nature grow up healthier, smarter, and happier.

In Nature School, children pursue their own interests at the pace of their choosing. The Nature School Guides watch and provide guidance to steer and spawn interests on individual basis. Before they start any activity, children learn to prepare their environment. Our children work in multi-age group setting.  Our multi-age grouping provides children with opportunities for broad social development. The younger children receive stimulation from the older children’s activities. The older children, in turn, benefit from helping the younger ones. They develop confidence, while solidifying their own concepts/knowledge, by teaching younger children. Our school in many ways resembles a family. Parental involvement adds to the Nature School community spirit. Nature School teaches kids to be independent, focused, motivated, curious, inquisitive, passionate, compassionate, tolerant, conscious of their surroundings, and above all – Love nature and be happy!";"http://natureschoolofaustin.com/";;" 7:30 am until 6:00 pm";;;"http://natureschoolofaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Nature-School-of-Austin-Parent-Guidebook-061715.pdf";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

We also have an extensive CACFP program, serving Early Head Start, Head Start and unaffiliated child care centers.

We’re very proud of the many programs we have to offer our children and families in San Antonio and Bexar County. PCI is a great place to work, to learn how to support your child in their early years and to send your child for a quality program.

With 13 Early Head Start/Head Start locations collectively in Bexar County, PCI offers a quality Early Childhood education program. Education, health, mental health, nutrition, infant/toddler, disabilities, family support, job training and professional development, literacy training, parent involvement, transition, wellness, and substance abuse education are just some of the many services provided.

Because of the richness in diversity we have here in San Antonio, we are surrounded by thousands of neighbors who all share a common interest in growing San Antonio's tomorrow. To that end, we are in the planning stages of forging a positive promotions campaign to bring awareness to the San Antonio community of the many facets of PCI. When you hear PCI, we want you to know – who we are, what we do and why we exist. We’re confident once you've heard and seen all that takes place within PCI, the quality things we do for children and families and how we impact the San Antonio community, you will want to partner with us in some meaningful capacity. The community will be kept informed throughout the process through our Website, Parent Gazette and word of mouth.

We work hard every day to ensure quality services for all of our children. In fact, PCI is highly recognized for its model program, quality services, committed staff and willingness to go that extra mile to prepare our children and families for tomorrow.

Working as a partner for the quality services we provide for our children and families is our Board of Directors, PCI Policy Council, and the Early Head Star/Head Start Center Parent Committees. We also have many business partners who act as volunteers that underscore the support of PCI.

PCI children are provided quality comprehensive services through the expertise of highly trained staff and educators. We invite you to support PCI and encourage you to become a partner in the effort to close the gap in educational preparedness and readiness. Parental Involvement and volunteer services are just a couple of ways to become more involved in the lives of our children. There's no better way to help further a child's education than to partner with PCI.

We present a unique opportunity for students to excel in both academics and fine arts. Stephanie's Dance Studio One West is a full size dance studio located inside the Preschool of Performing Arts West. This provides a daily, real dance studio experience for all our preschool students. Come and see the technique difference!

All of our academic instructors are certified teachers with a degree and experience teaching children. We teach an accelerated curriculum that provides challenging thought provoking lessons while still allowing children to work at their own rate. We allow students to soar above and beyond the group!

We are a private, Christian preschool academy for girls. As part of an all-girl school, students can focus on learning with fewer distractions. Our girls build self confidence, social skills & leadership skills while excelling in academics and the arts. We strive to create a positive, supportive, nurturing environment where learning is exciting and fun! 

Our curriculum is research based & systematic, helping our students grow intellectually and socially while building a solid foundation for future academic success. Skills are taught through small group instruction and literacy centers with a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 7. Certain lessons are also taught through large group instruction to reinforce new skills, teach group cooperation and leadership skills. Students will enjoy challenging lessons in phonics, emergent reading readiness, math concepts, language development, writing technique, social skills, problem solving, creative thinking, science experiments and hands on Smart board technology. 

Our Fine Arts program is technique based. We teach real technique in every subject to every age group. Dance is not just about learning the steps. Dance begins with total body conditioning. Strength and flexibility increase with time spent correctly using the science of stretching. Brain to muscle neurological connections are necessary for building coordination and balance as well as enhancing academic potential. It is so important to get the right start during the preschool years so that the child builds a strong network of neurological connections that will be there for a lifetime. 

Our Christian values are evident in our family friendly, age appropriate choice of music, choreography and costumes. We believe our dancers should be dressed for the stage, not the beach.  Our academic and fine art curriculum both strongly reinforce our commitment to teaching children manners and the value of sharing, caring for and helping others. We teach our students to be supportive and respectful of one another. We know that families have very different approaches to how they view religion so we do not teach religion classes. We do not provide a religious curriculum. We do provide a positive atmosphere where children are nurtured and encouraged to meet their full potential.

The founders of spilled milk social club each have extensively diverse experiences working with kids, and have come together, combining their super-forces to not only provide summer and after-school care for Central Austin families, but have also built a curriculum rich with thought provoking activities to encourage (for each child) the realization of their most prominent philosophy: EVERYONE HAS THE CAPACITY TO BE CREATIVE.
﻿
So, what’s all the hype about creative capacity, you may ask? We at smsc believe that no one has an excuse to utter the phrases “I’m not creative,” or “I can’t.” By providing youngsters with a variety of opportunities to create, craft, play, and  cooperatively experience success, we will aid in the development of strong, independent, and clever life long learners. In promoting creativity as an expectation rather than unattainable dream, our program fosters a sense of independence, critical thought, and empowerment. And we have lots and lots of fun in the process!
​
As founders of spilled milk social club, Stella Maxwell and Ali Epperson form a duo of super-creative, super-exciting, super-dedicated grown-ups-who-refuse-to-“grow-up.” Both graduates of the University of Child Craft with PhDs in general awesomeness, we share a common gratitude to Harma and Ken Jordan, who have owned and run Child Craft Schools since the dawn of time, and have contributed a great deal in our own growth and learning. While it isn’t our first foray into the world of awesomizing, (<- totally a word) kids, spilled milk social club is a big deal for us, as we’ve been building toward it for some time now. We’re two friends who love learning, imagination and creativity, but most of all, we love working with kids.

 spilled milk social club is a licensed child-care facility, under the standards put in place by the Department of Family and Protective Services (Operation #1565957). Ask us to show you a copy of our certificate when you come to visit, if you'd like!

The challenge for education is to support these strengths and abilities so that each child can grow and develop lifelong skills for problem solving, independence, curiosity, cooperation and a positive attitude towards learning.
 
Our goal is to join with families in the education of their children.  Together we create a community of learners in a supportive, nurturing environment that values our diversity and celebrates our differences.
 
We guide with love and understanding because one of the most important gifts we can give a child is the gift of a healthy self-esteem.  We respect each child, nurture his/her spirit, and embrace every culture so that everyone feels included.";"http://www.sunshine-academy.us/#!contact-us/c1gzt";;"Monday -Friday

We strive to develop the whole child through programs that build a healthy spirit, mind, and body for all, including the following:

Healthy Spirit -We offer daily devotion time, and a group discussion time, where youth have the opportunity to reflect on their day, talk about issues and concerns impacting their lives. Youth also develop a stronger understanding of the core YMCA values of Honesty, Respect, Responsibility, and Caring.

Healthy Mind -We know how important homework time is. We provide a structured study room where youth have 30-45 minutes of homework time. Staff are on hand to support youth as they work on their assignments.

We want our students to become independent, confident and lifelong learners with a strong sense of self. We want every child that enters through our front door to enter into a positive child centered preschool experience where they can develop their personalities and abilities through interconnecting with their parents, teachers and peers.  The goal for every child is to foster a love for learning in a warm and nurturing environment where students yearn to learn!

Children learn based upon their individual needs, and we at Little Scholars Preschool want to ensure that every child is provided with the opportunity to thrive. In order for our children to be successful lifelong learners, our curriculum is based on well researched practices and a structured routine environment. Our curriculum is based on the Rhode Island Early Learning and Development Standards. These standards allow our educators to provide quality lessons that are age appropriate and critical for school readiness. Ongoing assessments throughout the school year will be administered to confirm students are making progress. Assessment results are used to plan program improvements and to tailor ongoing curriculum for the individual child as well as the class as a whole.

Research shows that learning through play, using hands on multi-sensory activities, allows children to learn about the world around them and themselves. As children actively engage in play, they acquire new skills, make discoveries, determine how things work, learn rules and solve problems. It also provides opportunities for positive interactions with their peers and teachers. At Little Scholars Preschool, children will have adequate space to play, discover and explore in each domain. They will have access to many hands on manipulatives and materials to ensure that every student is having fun and is engaged at all times.

Parent participation is a very important part of our program. Open communication and relationships between parents, teachers and students is fundamental to a child’s success in school. This connective piece allows children to engage to their fullest and allows them to have a positive learning experience.  We encourage parent participation in our Parent Reading Program, volunteering or becoming a member of our Parent Advisory Council.

Together, we will make your child’s preschool experience one that they will cherish and never forget!";"http://www.littlescholarsri.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/littlescholarsri";"Mon-Fri:

here to provide all of your early care and education needs. We begin early care for children as young as six weeks old, transitioning them out of our school-age program at 12 years of age. As a participant in Delaware Stars, we are constantly aiming to improve our quality services to all of our children in every capacity of their development into young adults. 

 We are concerned with the development, guidance and well being of each and every child. Our children  are encouraged to reach their full potential in every aspect of development. Given the opportunity to express themselves creatively through hands-on, developmentally appropriate activities, children are learning to express pride in their play and work experiences.

 Children as young as six weeks will begin to work on accomplishing and learning developmental milestones, including fine motor skills (such as pointing, grasping & pulling on toys), and gross motor skills (to include sitting up, standing, eventually walking and running). Throughout their days at Little Sprouts, they will also work on social emotional skills (self-feeding & emotion regulation, etc.) and cognitive skills like recognizing safe adults, peers, and eventually preschool skills (counting, reading, recognizing colors and shapes). 

 All children will be provided with three balanced and nutritious meals through the USDA CACFP (Child & Adult Care Food Program), to include breakfast, lunch and an afternoon snack. As well as nutritious meals, children will participate in at least one hour of outdoors physical activity (weather-permitting) each day, so please dress them accordingly in order to have the most fun outdoors with their friends.

Other philosophies of education are man-cenered. Christian education is centered in the person of  Jesus Christ as revealed in the Word of God. The Christian philosophy holds that God, as the Ultimate Truth, becomes real to each person–man, woman or child–when that person accepts Christ, the crucified, risen Lord, through faith (“I am the way, the truth and the life” John 14:6). In keeping with these convictions, the school administration builds, and the teacher teaches, a curriculum that is God-centered. The entire educational program is designed to bring glory and honor to God and to encourage reverence for all of God’s creation in the heart and mind of each student. The student does not learn reverence for God through the intellectual process alone, but through accepting Jesus Christ as personal Savior. The student will then be open to guidance of the Holy Spirit in the learning of  skill, knowledge, and values. Teaching does not become Christian because we teach biblical truths alone, but rather because these truths are exemplified and practiced in the curriculum, activities, and everyday lives of students and staff. True Christian education is discovering and applying truth, seeing God revealed in truth, and recognizing that God alone is the Creator and that we are made in the image of God. The Bible is very clear in the establishment of the family unit as the primary social structure (Deuteronomy 11:19, Deuteronomy 6:1-9, Ephesians 6:1-4). MCA views itself as an extension of home; therefore, we exist to help parents meet their God-given responsibility to train their children to know and serve God.";"http://www.mcminnvillechristianacademy.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/McMinnville-Christian-Academy-402709306994/timeline/";"Mon-Fri:

Our curriculum weaves together the arts, academics and movement, with a reverence for the developing child. We nurture our children’s spirituality, cultivate their ability to think imaginatively and inspire them to seek the truth.

Our curriculum covers a full spectrum of traditional academic subjects and integrates artistic activities into the academics. This allows students to engage in learning at the emotional level. Painting, music and story are integral parts of academic lessons so that art becomes a conduit of knowledge, not an optional add-on. Kinesthetic learning is also interwoven through movement and crafts. Cedarwood cultivates a love of, and respect for, nature and the rhythms of the seasons through seasonal celebrations and daily time outdoors.

Cedarwood School first opened in October 1997 with one teacher and four students. Now, with over 280 students and a full array of subject classes, we have a thriving program. This has been further enhanced and enabled by the recent completion of a newly renovated wing on our beautiful building. In addition to two new classrooms, this renovation has given us a community kitchen, a spacious faculty room, a gorgeous performance space, an art display hall, and a fantastic music room. We can now truly serve our full pre-kindergarten-through-Grade 8 program and better share the fruits of this education with the Cedarwood community.";"http://www.cedarwoodschool.org/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/CedarwoodWaldorf/info/?tab=page_info";;;"http://www.cedarwoodschool.org/enrollment/";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.cedarwoodschool.org/wp-content/img/cedarwood-waldorf-school.jpg";;;;;;

The Willamette Infant Toddler Center (ITC) & Little Wolverines Preschool/Child Care Center believe child care can and should be an opportunity for education, with children learning their best through play, interactions and experiences.

    The ITC is open to infants ages 6 weeks -24 months and toddlers 24-36 months who are children of current Bethel School District employees and current Willamette students.
    The Little Wolverines program welcomes children from the public at-large who are ages 3-6 years old.

Children in the ITC and Little Wolverines have the opportunity to learn through a data-proven, play-oriented approach to early childhood education. Our staff values, honors and respects the diversity and developmental differences in all children. It is our desire to meet each child where they are in their life’s journey and to add rich and meaningful experiences during their time with us.

The professional educators in the ITC and Little Wolverines programs provide opportunities for affectionate, nurturing, stimulating, and age-appropriate activities. Through developmental screening, evaluations, daily observations, and parent/family input we build the foundation for developing individual and group activities for children. We believe that all children should be allowed to develop and grow at their own pace.

The ITC and Little Wolverines programs foster an environment where children can succeed and where parents and staff work together to provide the very best experiences for their children.

We recognize that children have a natural curiosity and a predisposition to enjoy the unexpected. Children engage in active exploration and investigation to make sense of their world. We strive to fuel children’s investigative impulses and encourage discovery, promote questioning and challenging of ideas, and formulate connections of experience.

We respect children’s multiple ways of demonstrating their intelligence. Children are encouraged to develop their individual strengths and each child’s unique contribution to their community is appreciated. Strengths are celebrated and valued while opportunities are created to provide exposure to, and enhancement of, other talents and skills. Children will be given the opportunity to express themselves through music, painting, drama, song, movement, and play.

A Journey School’s program draws from several models of child development including the Reggio Emilia model to create an inclusive, child-led, emergent program steeped in the belief that children are strong, capable, creative thinkers who can explore their ideas in myriad ways. Components which will be incorporated into our program include:

    Classrooms that are beautiful, inspirational spaces

•An appreciation and respect for the child’s natural stages of development

•The belief that children build knowledge through personal experiences

•The recognition that the years of early childhood possess within them the capacity for life-long habits, behaviors and attitudes

The WorldKids Montessori curriculum introduces our young students to culture through music, dance, food, language and dress, children expand their knowledge and understanding of the world.

Our curriculum introduces children to an excellent preschool curriculum that prepares them for the upcoming school years and immerses all students into Mandarin Chinese & Spanish! New cultures and traditions are explored monthly!

WorldKids students are learning new things every day by having fun and exploring the world by using their senses! Our young World citizens are developing their social, emotional, physical and cognitive foundations they need to succeed in their elementary school years- and throughout their lives!

At WorldKids-School we strongly believe in the approach of teaching in an ""Immersion"" learning environment! Students are immersed into Mandarin and Spanish! Enrolling your child in an immersion preschool or daycares can be more advantageous to your child's foreign language development than a program that offers a foreign language as a subject.

Children in total immersion programs work toward total fluency in the foreign language. They are more likely to ""think"" and function naturally in the language. ""Normally, they are able to achieve an extremely high level of overall competency.
Full immersion is less confusing than a translation-based curriculum, which is more appropriate for the adult learner. In addition, in a full foreign language immersion program, children have an opportunity to pro-actively use and rehearse foreign language in a challenging, intimate, emotionally supportive environment that stimulates all their senses.

The​ WorldKids​ culture is devoted to helping each child grow toward independence by building confidence, competence, self-esteem and respect for others. More than an approach to education, ​we use a ​Montessori approach to life. ​
​

WorldKids ​classrooms ​follow the Montessori ​multi-age mix ​class-room philosophy and encourage children to learn from each other and take on different roles while they grow within their group.";"http://worldkidsschool.com/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://worldkidsschool.com/images/logo.png";;;;;;

It is described as having been a positive influence on the entire school and surrounding community, an excellent organization, and responsible for fostering many good friendships among parents and teachers.

 
Edith Rasmusson, a parent, recalls, ""All working together to raise money to buy stage curtains and other extras to complete the 1946 building."" This organization also sponsored a ""Mothersingers"" group in the 1940s and 1950s, which numbered between 40 and 50 members. All were mothers of Finch students and enjoyed performing around Spokane, including the Spokane Music Festival.
 
During the 1970s and 1980s, the PTO almost died from lack of support from a charging society. However, in recent years, there has been a new effort to revitalize the or organization. Once again, parents unite in a variety of projects to support the students of Finch. Students are especially fond of wearing PTO-designed sweatshirts, T-shirts, hats, and sweatpants in the school color of red with the school mascot, the mustang, outlined in white.
 
The time that our Finch families contribute to our school is invaluable! If you are interested in volunteering at an event for in the classroom please see our Volunteer Opportunties page for more information.

We can provide these experiences through a nuturing, well planned environment that encourages play, exploration, curiosity, and problem solving.

Based on Catholic values, teachers and parents work together to offer learning that will develop skills necessary to make decisions regarding spiritual relationship with God, respect for life, fostering of diversity, and life-long health and sense of well-being.";"http://school.assumption.org/";;"8:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.";;"http://school.assumption.org/admissions.html";"http://school.assumption.org/uploads/Phoebe%20File/Parent%20Student%20Handbook%202015-2016.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://school.assumption.org/uploads/images/assumption_logo.jpg";;;;;;
