What do we believe?? We believe there is one God who exists in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We believe Jesus is the Son of God, was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, shed His blood and died in our place as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind, was buried, arose bodily from the grave and ascended into Heaven.

Her theories are based on observations of standard education practices. She felt that the traditional teaching method — based on repetition and memory, restraining and silencing students and relying on reward and punishment – were detrimental to child development. In its place she developed an alternative system called scientific pedagogy. She believed that all children possess an innate desire and ability to learn and that they simply needed an encouraging environment in which spontaneous activity could also be an educational tool. The Montessori method advocates hands-on activities rather than lecturing and is strongly reliant upon parent and community participation. These ideas have not only yielded highly positive results when put into practice, but have proven to be far superior in terms of brain development and fostering independence, self-reliance and personal responsibility. Montessori classrooms are organized in three-year age increments and emphasis is placed on age group interactions as part of the educational experience. Teachers are there to facilitate and guide individual interests and curiosity.";"http://ourvillagemontessori.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/ourvillagemontessori";"7:30am – 5:30pm

Following the seed-to-table concept, children have a blast as they plant, grow, and taste berries and veggies.

Children delight in feeding animals and gathering eggs as they learn in a healthy, natural setting. Teachers guide children to count, increase their vocabulary, and leave an intentional foot print as they learn to take care of the garden and animals on the farm. Children learn in small groups with only 7 children in each preschool classroom.

We care for children age 6 weeks to 12 years of age.

We believe that the preschool years should  be a time of joy and learning for children.  In our centers your child has the opportunity to mature and progress with guidance from our loving staff.

Agape Academy opened its doors with an enrollment of nearly 50 students in K5 through 3rd grade.
In the early days, the academy shared space within the church. In 1995, Agape Academy moved into their own Educational Building next to Agape Church and became a member of the Oral Roberts University Educational Fellowship (ORUEF). In 2002, another building was added on campus, which houses a full size gymnasium, lunchroom, auditorium, game room and more! Students have access to this beautiful facility throughout the year.
Because of a steadily increasing enrollment in 2004, Agape Academy made the decision to include K3, K4 and K5. In 2005 Agape Academy was granted accreditation status through International Christian Accrediting Association (ICAA). Today, Agape Academy provides Christ-centered bible-based curriculum that spans from K3 year olds through 5thgrade.
What once began as an educational opportunity for church members only, now encompasses the greater communities of Central and North Central Arkansas.
Agape Academy offers tuition payment on a monthly basis. Families that have more than one child can expect discounts, and we also offer scholarships / financial assistance where needed. Agape Academy has over 120 students that grace its doors each day. We have chosen the Christ-centered, bible-based ABeka curriculum to dispense the Word of God on a consistent and continual basis as each child is admonished and encouraged to seek God with all his or her heart.

We utilize integrated classroom settings to facilitate a learning environment where children that are typically developing and those with developmental needs share in the activities of the day; learning from each other, sharing in social interaction and individual learning opportunities, as well as, group activities provides for an all-inclusive experience.

There are a multitude of services that we provide at Beginnings, such as:  Speech Pathology/Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Nursing, Early Intervention, Transportation and Nutrition.  Due to the fact that NO two children do things at the same rate, each child will have a specific plan designed just for them.  This plan begins with an assessment.  In conjunction with the child’s primary care physician, a team of professionals will evaluate the child to determine their unique needs and develop an appropriate plan to meet these needs in the classroom, as well as, at home.  Once the plan has been formulated and put in action, the child will periodically be re-evaluated.

Something that you may not know about Beginnings is, if a child qualifies for services with us, they are provided at NO cost to the parent.  As a division of the Conway County Center for Exceptional Children, we help carry out the mission of the Center by enabling all persons served to achieve their individual potential through the implementation of developmental and age appropriate activities.";"http://centerforexceptionalchildren.org/beginnings/";"https://www.facebook.com/cccec";;;;;"not mentioned";"not mentioned";"not mentioned";"not mentioned";"not mentioned";"not mentioned";"http://centerforexceptionalchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cccec-header-small.jpg";;;;;;"Thursday"

 UCP Butterfly Learning Center is proud to offer a professional and caring staff, individualized instruction and developmentally appropriate practices.

BLC maintains low child to staff ratios of 1:4 for children ages six weeks to three years and 1:7 for three to five years.

 Learning environments are warm and inviting, encouraging children to explore and experience the world.  BLC has worked carefully to equip the classrooms with age appropriate materials and furnishings. BLC offers your child a nurturing environment which features a curriculum that focuses on thinking and reasoning, motor skills, social skills, self-help skills and language development. The use of children’s literature, muscular development through indoor and outdoor play, art activities, and music are major vehicles in helping children master new skills and gather information.

Responding carefully to the needs of children and their families in an always changing world requires flexibility and commitment.  Butterfly Learning Center is dedicated to these values.

Through the work of the Counseling and Education Center, Inc. the dire need to expand services soon became apparent.  

Our services are offered without cost to disenfranchised individuals who have often received fragmented services.  The Family Center, Inc. seeks to integrate services and uses a coordinated community response to promote the prevention and treatment of domestic violence. The Family Center, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 and opened Angels of Grace Battered Women’s Shelter in 1998. In 2007, a second shelter, Anna’s Place, was opened to address the lack of services available along the eastern border of the Arkansas delta region.  In order to address the issue of domestic violence in the Delta of eastern Arkansas, The Family Center, Inc. provides a broad range of services that include support groups, individual and family therapy, crisis counseling, assistance with compensation claims, legal advocacy, outreach, follow-up after leaving the shelter, medical and substance abuse advocacy, as well as assistance with personal care, food, clothing, and employment.

My name is Mollie Moore, and I am the Academy Director. With a degree in education as well as other early childhood education programs and 34 years of teaching and managing experience, I am committed to making your toughest decision in selecting child care/preschool much easier. Based on my extensive experience and education, I can confidently say our infant care, preschool and other age-specific programs are the best in the Fayetteville community.

Since being director of this school since 2008, I have treated everyone involved as if they were my own family - the children, parents and teachers alike. We want our learning center to be warm and welcoming and have an open-door policy for anyone who would like to talk. Monthly events encourage everyone to participate to ensure our families meet each other and develop strong relationships.

Our center here in Fayetteville is working towards accreditation at both the state and national levels. The standards we follow are higher than the State of Arkansas's Child Daycare Licensing Standards. Teachers have selected to follow these higher standards when implementing curriculum, maintaining the classroom, and communicating with you.

I find it rewarding when I overhear children telling their parents about the great day they had how much fun they had with their teachers and classmates. We are fortunate to have an outstanding staff dedicated to our children and families. More than half of our teachers have at least four years teaching experience. All of our teachers receive monthly training as well as ongoing training provided by our state's central professional registry program.

The purpose is for each child to grow and develop at his or her own pace. Each child is considered an individual. Our staff strives to nurture growth in feelings by loving, accepting and approving of the children for what they are. Good personal relationships are also encouraged so that the child gains independence and learns cooperation. Our program is designed to give your child a safe, stimulating environment in which to learn and grow. All classes have a structured day, with many learning activities taking place. These learning experiences are planned to challenge your child without exerting undue pressure to perform. We want your child to enjoy the time spent with us. We plan five holiday parties a year: Fall Festival, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's and Easter. Birthdays may be celebrated if the parent coordinates with the teachers in advance.Our Director of Mother's Day Out is the very experienced and loving Sarah Ables. We are a fully licensed facility and follow all state regulations pertaining to the welfare of children. Our program has been inspected and approved by the Arkansas Child Care Facility Review Board and by the local fire department. Fire and weather drills are practiced monthly. All staff members obtain continuing education requirements yearly and most are trained in CPR.

The goal is to provide the best and most professional care for each child. Young children learn best when they have hands-on activities. Each child will be provided with experiences in social development, music, art, science, math, and practical life skills. These activities will be presented to each child on a developmentally appropriate level. Each child will be stimulated, challenged, and never put in the position of possibly failing to accomplish a task.

We want to maintain a good relationship with each child. Including the parents, so they can be successful. We, as caregivers and parents, need a good rapport with each other in order to provide an enriched stimulation environment so children will have a secure relationship with parents. We can gain the child’s trust and confidence, which will allow us to help them use self control and create a great learning environment.

Our personal goal is to try to educate parents, especially young parents, about children. In doing this, I hope to instill in parents the very important job they have, that they need to provide a safe and stress-free (as possible) environment at home, and to also understand and support their children. As child care professionals, our creed to the parents, with their help, is to shape and mold children’s minds by using a variety of positive guidance methods.";"http://littledumplingschildcarecenter.com/contact/";"https://www.facebook.com/littledumplingschildcarecenter";"Mon - Fri:

The Montessori method of education is basically a unique approach to learning.  Unlike preschools which ""teach"" the child concepts, the Montessori preschool allows each child to learn as they work independently with the many materials in the classroom.  The Montessori teacher guides the classroom activity and carefully plans the environment in the interests of the children.  The teachers are trained to deal with each child individually, allowing each one to choose from many activities within their range of ability  This prepared environment encourages children to proceed at their own pace from simple activities to more complex ones.  As the children grow by satisfying their natural curiosity, they develop pride in their ""work"", gain confidence,  self-direction, respect for others and develop self discipline.  These attributes are invaluable as they enter other educational systems later in life.

Although individualized learning is important, socialization is very much a part of Montessori education.  Children interact continuously, often choosing to work on projects together.  Group activities and outside play are part of each day's schedule.";"http://www.montessorijonesboro.com/";;" 7:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m

We offer classes for all grades, preschool, kindergarten, elementary, and secondary.  All students learn the same subjects taught in the public schools, but from a Christian perspective.  The most important class, which we require every student to study, is Bible. 

As we grow, we plan to extend the preschool to include nursery.  If you drive by our facility, you will notice the construction behind the playground where four new classrooms will be housed.  We invite you to come by to view our facilities  and meet our staff.";"http://www.nhacademy.org/";;"M-F 6:00AM to 6:00PM

The direction, desire, and movement of North Hills have been to provide services and programs for children with disabilities. North Hills Services Inc., was established in 1957 out of the need for a program to educate and train the developmentally delayed in Pulaski county. North Hills was organized to fill the need for education and training of a child with a developmental disability and to awaken parents and educators to the fact that these children have their places in life, and under proper guidance, can find happiness. Our children range in developmental disabilities such as Autism, Down’s syndrome, Prader-Willi, and Global Developmental Delays.

At North Hills Services Inc. CDC All children are taught the skills necessary for daily life at home and in the community, as well as preparation for kindergarten. Our curriculum provides for development in all domains of learning. If determined by a multi-disciplinary team, a child may receive specialized therapy in Occupational Therapy addressing the child’s fine motor and sensory development. The child may also qualify for Physical Therapy addressing gross motor development and Speech Therapy addressing communication and oral motor concerns. Day Habilitation (another form of treatment offered) takes place in our classrooms and addresses all areas of development including gross motor, fine motor, communication and socialization, cognition, and self-help skills.

Our program stresses parental involvement since most of our families are perplexed due to inexperience of handling a child with a developmental delay. We are here to try to help parents understand their child’s disability and its impact on normal childhood development. The mission of North Hills Services Inc. exists to provide a vehicle to enable persons with developmental disabilities to achieve to their maximum potential. This has been our mission throughout our years and continues to be.

    The core academic program is further enhanced by each teacher being called to teach as Jesus did with love, respect, and strong Christian values.
    Our religious program follows those precepts of the Catholic faith on which we as a school are founded, realizing that religious foundation begins and continues in the home first, also keeping in mind that each person is to be respected for his/her beliefs.
    We follow the teachings of Jesus in every approach we take with the children entrusted to us, thus incorporating our faith in Jesus Christ into the daily task of teaching.

Salem Lutheran School is a part of the heritage of Christian education in the Lutheran Church that goes back to early colonial times in America.  By the 1870’s, some 40 years after the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod was organized, over 400 Lutheran schools served 25,000 children.  Today, there are more than 2,200 Lutheran early childhood centers, elementary and secondary schools serving over 280,000 students.  God has charged us to serve Him by providing children a quality education that meets the needs of young Christians living amid change in our society today.  Salem Lutheran School is an outstanding blessing of God, educating children in the truest and most meaningful sense of the term – providing learning experiences that are both quality and Christian. We offer personalized instruction in a caring Christian family atmosphere.  As Christian educators, we consider it our responsibility and privilege to serve the spiritual, intellectual, aesthetic, emotional, social, and physical needs of God’s children.  Together, with the Christian home and church, we nurture and provide admonition in the Lord.  We trust that our efforts, blessed by the Spirit, will allow our students to grow up to be blessings to all whose lives touch theirs.

The hours of operation are 7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for holidays, Christmas break and spring break as prescribed in each child’s individual service plan (IFSP or IEP). The areas of Habilitation will be gross motor, fine motor, language, social/emotional and self-care. Each child receiving habilitation will be assessed using a criterion-based developmental assessment and other pertinent information. A team consisting of parents, guardians, teachers, psychologists, therapists and any others requested will determine the needs of each eligible child. Due process will be adhered to for each eligible child and each will be eligible to receive developmental, occupational, transportation, physical and speech therapies as determined in the service plan. Preschool habilitation services for eligible children will be provided at no cost to the parent/guardian.

Breakfast, lunch and one snack will be provided. Persons responsible for this component are the Executive Director and Preschool Administrator. The Preschool Administrator will be a certified teacher with/or working on certification in Early Childhood Special Education. Ratio requirements for ages 0-3 are 1:4 and for ages 3-5, 1:7.

The preschool will strive to create an educational system that closely relates to the natural environment of all children, with or without disabilities by providing an integrated preschool that allots a selective number of slots to children without delays or developmental disabilities.

Pre-school service is a facility-based program desgined to provide specialized services to children who have been diagnosed as developmentally disabled or developmentally delayed and who are not school age.  School age is defined as having reached the age of five years on or before the date set by the Arkansas Department of Education.  A child reaching age five after that date is not considered school age until the next school year.

Services must be provided for the purpose of teaching habilitation goals as set forth in the plan of care.  Services are established on a unit-of-service basis.  Each unit of service equals one hour.  A maximum of five units per day is allowed.

Time spent in transit from the person’s place of residence to the provider facility and from the facility back to the person’s place of residence is not included in the unit of service calculation.";"http://www.advantageseark.org/discovery-childrens-center/";;"7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.advantageseark.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DCD-logo-pink-242x300.jpg";;;;;;

Shiloh’s mission is to “Develop Godly leaders who engage their culture and change it.” Shiloh believes that Christian education is the process of teaching and learning conducted by born-again Christian teachers in an environment where God and His Word are the highest authority. From individual classroom attention, to a championship athletic tradition, Shiloh prepares students to reach their full potential in a distinctly Christian environment. Unmatched in college preparation, students who graduate from Shiloh are prepared to attend college anywhere, including some of the most prestigious academic institutions of higher learning in the country.

Southwest Christian Academy is an independent, interdenominational, educational institution dedicated to academic excellence and the care and development of the total child.

Southwest Christian Academy began June 1, 1987, with 27 students for summer day care and leased Charity Community Church’s facility at 11111 Geyer Springs Road in Little Rock, AR. As the student body grew, three portable buildings were purchased by the school to accommodate the increased enrollment. In 1995, new facilities were completed on the adjacent lot, north of Charity Community Church to house approximately 200 students. Five new classrooms were added to the main facility in 1997.

 This purpose is directed toward a deeper acceptance of holiness from God in affiliation with the Sacraments, the doctrines, and the structures of the Catholic Church.

We believe that education includes not only the attainment of knowledge, but also the acquisition of values and the discovery of truth. To that end, Saint Boniface Catholic School strives to create a unique setting in which instruction in religious truths and values is an integral part of the school program.

The development of the whole person of the student (spiritual, intellectual, personal, social, and physical) is the focus of Catholic education. We serve children regardless of race, color, national or ethnic origin, gender or handicap. Saint Boniface Catholic School strives to educate the students and prepare them for their place in life as adults, instilling in them the knowledge that as adults they will be called upon to serve and to be responsible for others.

The teachers, as partners with the parents, play a significant role in this educational ministry as they daily bear witness to the meaning of mature faith and Christian living through their instruction and by their example. They teach about faith and values and openness to Christ in many ways beyond formal activity.";"http://stbonifaceschool.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Boniface-Catholic-School/171192922902590";"7:30 AM - 4:00 PM, Monday - Friday";;"http://stbonifaceschool.org/admission/";"http://stbonifaceschool.org/uploads/handbook15.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://stbonifaceschool.org/uploads/layout/stbo-logo.png";;;;;;

Our mission is to provide and to promote a high quality, developmentally appropriate child development program for economically deprived children three to five years of age, thus reducing the potential for school failure.

Our vision is for all children to have the right to be healthy and live in a safe and nurturing environment. Recognizing diversity, and that a child's family is his or her primary teacher.

As a ministry of Grace Church of Bryant, Sunshine Academy was opened with the idea that daycare and preschool could be a second home for kids. Hugs are just as important as the ABCs here.

At Sunshine, we offer a well-rounded educational program in a warm and happy environment. Our teachers are educated and well trained to work with young children. Our staff have an intense passion to work with children and are encouraged to impart the knowledge of God’s infinite mercy and love.

We have a family environment where all the children know all the staff and all the staff know all the children. This makes the transition from class to class run smoothly and makes your child feel very much at home.

Small classes with low teacher/child ratios, experienced staff and a superior program based on helping each child develop as an individual are just the beginning.

We believe all children have unique gifts and potentials. We encourage the participation and collaboration of the children and we respect and appreciate the ideas, suggestions, and creativity of each child. We design our activities carefully to stimulate children’s thinking, creativity, problem-solving and decision-making skills.

At that time, however, there were two separate programs being operated: The Cottage of Hope and the Dr. John T. Gray Memorial School. In 1990, these two consolidated and formed what is presently known as The Learning Center. Currently, The Learning Center provides facilities and services for children with disabilities from birth to five years of age on two campuses in Jonesboro. Home-based and community intervention services are also provided in Northeast Arkansas. Physical, occupational and speech therapy are critical components of the services system as well as a variety of other support programs.

The Learning Center also provides adult development services for adults with disabilities. The Administrative offices are located at 2808 Fox Meadow Lane in Jonesboro.

The Learning Center receives funds from Arkansas Developmental Disabilities Services, the Department of Human Services, United Way of Northeast Arkansas, and UCP. Donations from individuals, civic groups and other organizations are also welcomed.

The Learning Center is always pleased to provide appropriate acknowledgments for all memorial gifts. These funds permit us to continually upgrade our program and more effectively meet the needs of individuals with disabilities.

The LA process seeks to engineer a quality-learning environment that goes far beyond an academic experience. LA provides students with the knowledge and experience that will endure throughout their lives. The LA student must be drawn by a clear picture of a preferred future and not necessarily shaped by the past or present circumstances. To build this strong future we rely upon time-tested principles, values, and methods. LA is built upon a value-based system of education and development as outlined by the Word of God. This system is especially relevant in the environment of the 21st century, which is global, technological, fast paced, and very challenging. LA provides an environment and culture that is able to provide not only academic excellence but also develops students of integrity, character, and confidence who are aware of their individual purpose, worth, and societal responsibility. LA students will emerge well prepared and thoroughly equipped for any mandate or purpose that may be upon their individual lives. LA focuses on the holistic development of each child. Students will be developed in an environment that focuses on academics, spiritual, social, as well as physical development. Education is a tool for human development and it must shape the understanding and mentalities of students. It is a journey from ignorance to knowledge, depravity to understanding, and folly to wisdom. It is a deliberate move from self-centeredness to community-mindedness.";"http://www.legacyacademyonline.com";;;;"http://legacyacademyonline.mediabyrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/LA_Registration_Form_Submittable.pdf";"http://legacyacademyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Student-Handbook-2014-20153.pdf";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://legacyacademyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/header-01b-cut.jpg";;;;;;

Out of that vision, Victory Baptist School was born.

Over the years, Victory Baptist school has emerged as a leader in private Christian education to the central Arkansas community. To this day, Victory Baptist School seeks to challenge our students to be thinkers with a solid Christian foundation to stand on.

Our school is built on a four-fold partnership with the school, home, church and community to instill the values necessary for a successful life. Starting in preschool, our expectations are high and our students consistently test beyond their current educational level. The environment of Victory Baptist School is one of order and structure to ensure teaching and learning takes place.

This is a place where faculty, students and parents work hand in hand as one team. We have provided a solid educational system for over 41 years, and are thankful to have a school that has provided countless students a strong Christian education; a school that has not lost its vision; and a school whose parents and supporters are committed to providing the best education for future generations.

Our aim is to provide a Christian perspective on the total world view from which will produce a balanced personality and a proper understanding and acceptance of a person’s role in life at home, at work, at play and worship — all grounded in the Christian concept of love. The spiritual must permeate all areas, else we become textbook-oriented rather than student oriented. 

This philosophy channels our energies to promote high academic standards while helping the student to achieve skills in creative and critical thinking using the best integrated curriculum available.  The objective of our instructional program is to enable the student to pursue the post-secondary education of his or her choosing, whether in college, university or in vocational training areas.

These issues provide the basis of West Side Christian School’s Mission Statement:  “ … to teach a Christian world view in spiritual and community life, inspire and equip students to reach their potential in academics, and help develop well-balanced members of society.""";"http://www.westsidechristianschool.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/West-Side-Christian-School/140522242695994";"7:55 a.m.-3:15 p.m.";;"http://www.westsidechristianschool.org/#!student-application/c1htp";"http://www.westsidechristianschool.org/#!warriorhandbook/c212k";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/102be8_d5fdaff954b944eb96a867abeb22a74b.png_srz_p_102_139_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_png_srz";;;;;;

Chronological age should be 5 years to 21 years. Students who exhibit an IQ lower than 65 may not be considered due to the intense academic nature of this program. The child's total language age of 2.5 years or higher is required. Students should be independent in feeding and toileting. Students should not exhibit aggressive behaviors that would cause danger to others. Any student whose primary barrier to learning is a behavior disorder will be referred to an appropriate setting to address those needs. The LEAD program currently admits students in kindergarten through high school who meet established criteria without regard for race, religion, ethnic origin, gender or disability.
Each applicant is individually interviewed and tested by the admissions team. The test and interview results are used to determine the best placement for every student. If it is determined that LEAD cannot meet the educational requirements of a certain student, the admissions team will meet with the parents to explain why the school cannot place their child.

We are brought together by shared goals for our children, both spiritual and academic.

Young children find an environment where they are loved because they are viewed as gifts from God. Students learn every subject from teachers who are constantly seeking to share a biblical perspective. Parents find new allies in their efforts to raise their children as young Christian men and women.

At Liberty we envision a school where students find an environment where peer pressure works toward education and Christian citizenship, not negative behavior. We work to create an atmosphere where academic achievement and spiritual growth is valued and doesn't conflict with social acceptance. We join with parents in establishing a proper foundation for a lifetime of success, hand-in-hand with a lifetime relationship with God.

Roberts uses the Common Core standards to prepare each student to be college and career ready in literacy and math at the end of high school.

Our mission  is that through ongoing collaboration, innovative technology, and an enriching curriculum, in partnership with our families and community, Roberts Elementary is committed to establishing a distinguished tradition of excellence in a diverse environment by nurturing, inspiring and challenging each student to value learning, respect and to always do the right thing.

Don R. Roberts Elementary is the newest school in the Little Rock School District.  It opened in August 2010.  Named after Dr. Don R. Roberts, former Director of the Arkansas Department of Education from 1979-1984.  After his retirement he returned to the Little Rock School District as interim Superintendent and led the district through the selection process of a new superintendent. 

While working for the Little Rock School District, Dr. Roberts was recognized for his leadership and was noted as ""well-respected"" by members of the community and media. Dr. Roberts is known for his ability to build bridges between businesses and schools in the communities where he has led school districts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette characterized his superintendence as ""serious business."" The Arkansas Times noted his tenure as ""an uncommon period of tranquility."" His legacy we most choose to follow is to “always do the right thing”.  This is a quote heard often from Dr. Roberts during his years of working in the field of educating all students, and it is this quote we have chosen for the motto of our school.  Roberts elementary school consists of dedicated high performing students, parents and staff that believe in always doing the right thing.

The two story, 147,431 square-foot building features two art rooms, two music rooms, a gymnasium, large dining room, an EAST lab and a state of the art media center.  A unique learning environment that provides for community learning in multipurpose areas for gatherings and specials projects.";"http://schools.lrsd3.org/?q=content/don-r-roberts-elementary";;;"http://www.lrsd.org/drupal/?q=content/human-resources";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

We offer a wide variety of services and strive to provide our clients and their families with tools tailored to meet their individual needs.  These needs are determined through an assessment made by the child’s primary care physician and a team of professionals.

Once the client’s needs are defined, a custom plan outlining the distinct services needed is provided.  Since each child is different, their plans are too.  Some plans will encompass all services offered by Step by Step while others will include only a select few.  Services like Occupational, Physical & Speech Therapies, Nursing, Early Intervention, Transportation & Nutrition can become quite costly; however, the beauty of Step by Step is that if your child qualifies for our programming, it is provided at NO cost to the parent!

As a part of the CCCEC, we aim to help carry out the mission of the Center by enabling all persons served to achieve their individual potential through the implementation of the above stated services and age appropriate activities.";"http://centerforexceptionalchildren.org/step-by-step/";"https://www.facebook.com/stepbystep.cccec/info?tab=page_info";"Mon - Fri:

The hours of operation are 7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for holidays, Christmas break and spring break as prescribed in each child’s individual service plan (IFSP or IEP). The areas of Habilitation will be gross motor, fine motor, language, social/emotional and self-care. Each child receiving habilitation will be assessed using a criterion-based developmental assessment and other pertinent information. A team consisting of parents, guardians, teachers, psychologists, therapists and any others requested will determine the needs of each eligible child. Due process will be adhered to for each eligible child and each will be eligible to receive developmental, occupational, transportation, physical and speech therapies as determined in the service plan. Preschool habilitation services for eligible children will be provided at no cost to the parent/guardian.

Breakfast, lunch and one snack will be provided. Persons responsible for this component are the Executive Director and Preschool Administrator. The Preschool Administrator will be a certified teacher with/or working on certification in Early Childhood Special Education. Ratio requirements for ages 0-3 are 1:4 and for ages 3-5, 1:7.

The preschool will strive to create an educational system that closely relates to the natural environment of all children, with or without disabilities by providing an integrated preschool that allots a selective number of slots to children without delays or developmental disabilities.

Pre-school service is a facility-based program desgined to provide specialized services to children who have been diagnosed as developmentally disabled or developmentally delayed and who are not school age.  School age is defined as having reached the age of five years on or before the date set by the Arkansas Department of Education.  A child reaching age five after that date is not considered school age until the next school year.

Services must be provided for the purpose of teaching habilitation goals as set forth in the plan of care.  Services are established on a unit-of-service basis.  Each unit of service equals one hour.  A maximum of five units per day is allowed.

Time spent in transit from the person’s place of residence to the provider facility and from the facility back to the person’s place of residence is not included in the unit of service calculation.

The program is administered by Central Kentucky Community Action Council, Inc. serving a six county area. The counties are Hardin, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, and Washington.  The Head Start Central Office is located in Lebanon. 

The Head Start program operates a full-day, full year program in the service area.  The program is funded to serve 543 Head Start families through center-based programming, depending upon the circumstances of the family and other criteria. 

Children who attend the Head Start program participate in a variety of activities that help them grow mentally, socially, emotionally and physically. They also receive the following: medical and dental care, healthy meals and snacks, and enjoy playing indoors and outdoors in a safe setting. Daily learning activities are planned and carried out by a qualified teaching staff who emphasize each child’s individual development in the areas of language development, literacy (pre-reading skills), math, science, creative arts, and social and emotional development. 

Head Start’s mission is to provide quality comprehensive services to income eligible preschool children to enhance their readiness for school. Family involvement in education, self-sufficiency and parent education is also emphasized. 

Recognizing that parents are the primary educators of their children, the program will provide opportunities to enhance their growth and well being by serving as a vehicle to promote self-sufficiency through collaboration with community resources. 

The program is designed to maximize the strengths and unique experiences of each child. The family, which is perceived as the principal influence on the child’s development, is encouraged to be a direct participant in the program. 

The three major content areas are: Program Design & Management involving Governance of Program Operations; Early childhood Development & Health involving Education, Health/Dental/Mental Health, Special and Disability Services, and Family and Community Partnerships involving Family/Social Service, Parent Involvement and Transportation.

The program is administered by Central Kentucky Community Action Council, Inc. serving a six county area. The counties are Hardin, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, and Washington.  The Head Start Central Office is located in Lebanon. 

The Head Start program operates a full-day, full year program in the service area.  The program is funded to serve 543 Head Start families through center-based programming, depending upon the circumstances of the family and other criteria. 

Children who attend the Head Start program participate in a variety of activities that help them grow mentally, socially, emotionally and physically. They also receive the following: medical and dental care, healthy meals and snacks, and enjoy playing indoors and outdoors in a safe setting. Daily learning activities are planned and carried out by a qualified teaching staff who emphasize each child’s individual development in the areas of language development, literacy (pre-reading skills), math, science, creative arts, and social and emotional development. 

Head Start’s mission is to provide quality comprehensive services to income eligible preschool children to enhance their readiness for school. Family involvement in education, self-sufficiency and parent education is also emphasized. 

Recognizing that parents are the primary educators of their children, the program will provide opportunities to enhance their growth and well being by serving as a vehicle to promote self-sufficiency through collaboration with community resources. 

The program is designed to maximize the strengths and unique experiences of each child. The family, which is perceived as the principal influence on the child’s development, is encouraged to be a direct participant in the program. 

The three major content areas are: Program Design & Management involving Governance of Program Operations; Early childhood Development & Health involving Education, Health/Dental/Mental Health, Special and Disability Services, and Family and Community Partnerships involving Family/Social Service, Parent Involvement and Transportation.

In 1964, the Federal Government asked a panel of child development experts to draw up a program to help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. The panel report became the blueprint for Project Head Start.

Project Head Start, launched as an eight-week summer program by the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1965, was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing preschool children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional and psychological needs. Recruiting children age three to school age entry, Head Start was enthusiastically received by educators, child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the Nation.

In 1969, Head Start was transferred from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Office of Child Development in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and has now become a program within the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Head Start has evolved into a program that provides education, health and social services. Education includes preschool education to national standards that have become de facto standards for all U.S. preschools. Health services include screenings, health check–ups, and dental check–ups. Social services provide family advocates to work with parents and assist them in accessing community resources.

KRFDC’s Head Start program began in 1966. The earliest records indicate that in 1974 Head Start was funded at $435,424 and served 330 children (95 in Clark, 60 in Estill, 115 in Madison, and 60 in Powell County. At the time, the program employed 73 people.

Since 1966, KRFDC Head Start services have expanded into Garrard, Jackson, Laurel, and Rockcastle counties. In 2009 KRFDC Early Head Start was funded to serve children in Clark, Estill, Madison, and Powell counties.

Today, KRFDC’s Head Start funding is $6.7 million to provide Head Starts services to 856 children ages 3-4 in Clark (210), Estill (53), Garrard (46), Jackson (102), Laurel (117), Madison (175), Powell (128), and Rockcastle (25) counties; as well as Early Head Start services to 84 children birth-3 years-old in Clark (10), Estill (8), Madison (38), and Powell (28) counties.

In 1964, the Federal Government asked a panel of child development experts to draw up a program to help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. The panel report became the blueprint for Project Head Start.

Project Head Start, launched as an eight-week summer program by the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1965, was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing preschool children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional and psychological needs. Recruiting children age three to school age entry, Head Start was enthusiastically received by educators, child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the Nation.

In 1969, Head Start was transferred from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Office of Child Development in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and has now become a program within the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Head Start has evolved into a program that provides education, health and social services. Education includes preschool education to national standards that have become de facto standards for all U.S. preschools. Health services include screenings, health check–ups, and dental check–ups. Social services provide family advocates to work with parents and assist them in accessing community resources.

KRFDC’s Head Start program began in 1966. The earliest records indicate that in 1974 Head Start was funded at $435,424 and served 330 children (95 in Clark, 60 in Estill, 115 in Madison, and 60 in Powell County. At the time, the program employed 73 people.

Since 1966, KRFDC Head Start services have expanded into Garrard, Jackson, Laurel, and Rockcastle counties. In 2009 KRFDC Early Head Start was funded to serve children in Clark, Estill, Madison, and Powell counties.

Today, KRFDC’s Head Start funding is $6.7 million to provide Head Starts services to 856 children ages 3-4 in Clark (210), Estill (53), Garrard (46), Jackson (102), Laurel (117), Madison (175), Powell (128), and Rockcastle (25) counties; as well as Early Head Start services to 84 children birth-3 years-old in Clark (10), Estill (8), Madison (38), and Powell (28) counties. Currently, the program employs 115 people.";"http://www.foothillscap.org/Services/HeadStartLocations.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kentucky-River-Foothills-Head-Start/732197740195838";;"http://www.foothillscap.org/JobOpportunities/JobOpportunities.html";"http://www.foothillscap.org/Services/HeadStartHowtoEnroll.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.foothillscap.org/Services/Images/foothills-logo2.png";;;;;;

The program is administered by Central Kentucky Community Action Council, Inc. serving a six county area. The counties are Hardin, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, and Washington.  The Head Start Central Office is located in Lebanon. 

The Head Start program operates a full-day, full year program in the service area.  The program is funded to serve 543 Head Start families through center-based programming, depending upon the circumstances of the family and other criteria. 

Children who attend the Head Start program participate in a variety of activities that help them grow mentally, socially, emotionally and physically. They also receive the following: medical and dental care, healthy meals and snacks, and enjoy playing indoors and outdoors in a safe setting. Daily learning activities are planned and carried out by a qualified teaching staff who emphasize each child’s individual development in the areas of language development, literacy (pre-reading skills), math, science, creative arts, and social and emotional development. 

Head Start’s mission is to provide quality comprehensive services to income eligible preschool children to enhance their readiness for school. Family involvement in education, self-sufficiency and parent education is also emphasized. 

Recognizing that parents are the primary educators of their children, the program will provide opportunities to enhance their growth and well being by serving as a vehicle to promote self-sufficiency through collaboration with community resources. 

The program is designed to maximize the strengths and unique experiences of each child. The family, which is perceived as the principal influence on the child’s development, is encouraged to be a direct participant in the program. 

The three major content areas are: Program Design & Management involving Governance of Program Operations; Early childhood Development & Health involving Education, Health/Dental/Mental Health, Special and Disability Services, and Family and Community Partnerships involving Family/Social Service, Parent Involvement and Transportation.

By providing the best possible daycare to children, we are contributing to the happiness and the security of their parents and to the community they live in.

First and foremost, Youthland Academy provides children constant and alert supervision in a safe environment, screened from hazards. The large classroom with designated area for learning centers provide for both quiet and active play. Our entire program is designed to enable children to have a positive self-concept and to know success and fulfillment through programs of positive self-concept and to know success from the beginning. This is possible because our Academy environment provides children the opportunity to be safe in their quest as natural leaders.

Youthland Academy isn't merely a childcare center, it's a ""learning center"" that assists children to realize success and fulfillment through programs of positive self-image. Children experience the joy of learning; they feel loved and accepted. Our program is our attitude.

Our Teachers and Directors are provided monthly themes that ignite each child's unique pleasure in learning. The monthly curriculum suggests proven ways to include these themes in a variety of ""discovery centered"" activities. Using the curriculum's themes, each teacher designs individualized lesson plans. We do not adhere to the standardized lesson plan because we feel there is no standard child or standard class. This is why we keep our teacher-child ratio at the level that comfortably supports personal attention.

Included with classroom discovery and stimulation are field trips. At some of our Academies, we also provide activities such as gymnastics and dance classes. These services enable parents to further enrich their children's lives without cutting into the quality time parents and children share after working hours.

Progress reports are given to parents to keep them up-to-date on the total growth of their children. Formal conferences are scheduled yearly to discuss a child's progress. However, parents are encouraged to meet their child's teacher and director, and visit the Academy at any time they feel necessary.";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/";;"Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.  ";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/careers";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/attachments/14/enrollment1.pdf";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/attachments/124/ParentHandbook2k14.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

They come into town greeted with smiles and praise. Taking nature walks and finger painting, is how they spend their days. Where knowledge is king and playtime his queen, it takes a town to grow a child if you know what we mean.

Our philosphy is simple and we think you''ll agree, the children come first just like A before C.  Our town is a family full of teachers and tots, that grow together and take naps on comfy  blue cots. Now this rhyming may seem silly, but we promise you this, when your child leaves town they'll be ready for K-6.

A home away from home is what we hope to be.  Bright brilliant children is exactly what they'll be. You should take a trip into town today, to see how we seek fun in learning and hide knowledge in play.";"http://www.thetoddlertown.com/#!contact";;;"http://www.thetoddlertown.com/#!documents/forms";"http://www.thetoddlertown.com/#!documents/forms";"http://www.thetoddlertown.com/#!documents/forms";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

It is the philosophy of the school that early childhood should be a time of fun, warmth, security, exploring, and discovery. Children are creative and receptive; the staff strives to nurture and encourage these qualities in children who attend the school. The preschool purpose is to provide an atmosphere to encourage social, emotional, physical, and intellectual growth.

We are  a licensed child care center that provides care and education to children ranging in age from 6 weeks to 12 years of age.  We offer full time care to children 6 weeks to 6 years of age with a before and after school program and summer camp for school age children.  Our hours of operation are Monday-Friday 6:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.

 We offer many special features that go above and beyond what is required by state licensing.  We have lower child to teacher ratios and smaller class sizes.  This allows our teachers to provide more individualized care, education and better capability to meet children's specific needs.  We recognize that each child learns and progresses at his/her own speed and incorporate that into our daily curriculum.  Our teachers are required to attend a higher number of professional development trainings on an ongoing basis and have higher levels of education. 

St. Benedict Center uses Creative Curriculum which provides a hands-on approach to learning which research has shown, is the way children learn the best.  Creative Curriculum stresses the importance of individualized attention and developmental goals.  We also work on all aspects of children's growth including social/emotional skills, physical  and fine motor development, early literacy and math skills, science and discovery, music and movement, and the arts.

 The teachers of St. Benedict have recently engaged in a study of the philosophy of Reggio Emilia, Italy.  The schools in Reggio Emilia have been touted some of the best in the world. This particular teaching approach puts children at the heart of the philosophy, believed children are beautiful, powerfuland competent and should be given the potential to develop their potential.

​St. Benedict Center provides breakfast, lunch and an afternoon snack. We are part of the federal food program which requires higher quality and nutritional foods to be provided to the children.  We offer a wide variety of healthy food choices and introduce children to new foods.

We are committed to helping your child grow and progress over time. Following the Kentucky Early Childhood Standards, our curriculum invites children to learn, explore, and thrive.

Curriculum includes thematic units with hands-on exploration. Teachers incorporate art, music and movement, learning centers, circle time and story time. We provide physical education in our full size gym and play time on our courtyard enclosed playgrounds.

Daniel S. Warner and several associates sought to forsake denominational hierarchies and formal creeds, trusting solely in the Holy Spirit as their overseer and the Bible as their statement of belief. These individuals saw themselves at the forefront of a movement to restore unity and holiness to the church. Their aim was not to establish another denomination but to promote primary allegiance to Jesus Christ so as to transcend denominational loyalties.
 
This movement is not historically related to the several Church of God bodies rooted in the holiness revival of Tennessee and the Carolinas in the late nineteenth century. Although it shares their holiness commitment, it does not emphasize the charismatic gift of speaking in tongues generally associated with Pentecostal churches.
 
Deeply influenced by Wesleyan theology and Pietism, the church’s generally accepted teachings include the divine inspiration of Scripture; forgiveness of sin through the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of the believer; the experience of holiness; the personal return of Christ, unconnected with any millennial reign; the kingdom of God as established here and now; the resurrection of the dead; and a final judgment in which there will be reward for the righteous and punishment for the wicked.
 
Within the church, baptism by immersion is viewed as a witness to the new believer’s regeneration in Christ and inclusion in the family of God. The Lord’s Supper reminds participants of the grace experienced in the life of the believer. Foot washing is practiced in acknowledgement and acceptance of the servant ministry of all Christians to each other and to the world. These symbolic acts are understood to be affirmative reminders of what God has done in Christ. None of these practices, termed ordinances, are considered mandatory conditions of Christian experience or fellowship.
 
There is no formal membership. Individuals are assumed to be members on the basis of personal conversion and conduct that supports that conversion experience. This is consistent with the church’s understanding of how Christian unity is to be achieved—a unity based on spiritual experience rather than creedal agreement.
 
The Church of God is congregational in its government. Each local congregation is autonomous. Ministers meet in voluntary state, regional, and national assemblies, and other associations. In North America, the General Assembly, composed primarily of ministers but also including lay congregational delegates, meets in connection with the movement’s annual North American Convention held in Anderson, Indiana.
 
In 1996 and 1997, the General Assembly initiated a restructuring of the work of the national ministries of the Church of God within the United States. The result was the formation of Church of God Ministries Inc. Priorities for the work of this organization are identified by representatives selected from the grassroots church.
 
In 1891, the movement’s first missionary was sent to Mexico. Since those early days, the Church of God has continued to grow into a multinational community of faith. At present, the largest concentrations of U.S. churches are in the Midwest, along the Pacific Coast, and in western Pennsylvania. Average weekend attendance in the congregations of the United States and Canada totals approximately 250,000. There are approximately 2,300 congregations in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, the movement has work in eighty-nine countries and territories representing approximately 7,300 churches and more than 750,000 believers.";"http://www.plcog.org/daycare";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://plcog.org/images/library/daycare_logo.jpg";;;;;;

There were few resources or supplies specifically for toddlers or preschoolers. there was little educational requirements for teachers. We learned what we needed and designed our curriculum and activities as we went along. Now there are unlimited resources and programs available that our staff uses to their full advantage.

We are very proud of Our House today and our accomplishments since 1978. We’re still as excited to welcome new students into our school as we were when we began.

We are better prepared now with associates’ degrees in early childhood education, annual training, and feedback from children and parents.

Today, Chrysalis House is a comprehensive agency with three residential facilities, a forty-unit apartment complex, eighteen scattered-site apartments, a 18,000 square foot, multi-purpose community center, and two playgrounds.

In addition to substance abuse treatment, Chrysalis House provides mental health treatment, case management, domestic violence counseling, computer training, GED tutoring, vocational training and job placement assistance, access to medical care, housing assistance, and children’s services. Chrysalis House believes in collaboration and maintains over seventy contracts or agreements with community partners.

Chrysalis House specializes in treating pregnant and parenting women.  We allow mothers to keep their newborns and toddlers on-site with them while in residential treatment. Admission of pregnant women is prioritized to ameliorate the effects of alcohol or drugs on the unborn child. Almost 33% of women entering Chrysalis House are pregnant and deliver babies while in the program.

I don’t think I could have ever called myself a mom before I came here. I actually want to be a mom again. For a long time I would come home and didn’t want to feed the kids and bathe the kids and do everything that I had to do. And since I am here I am clean again and I have the energy and the desire to do the things that I need to do on a daily basis for my kids.Helping women achieve the capacity to provide for themselves and their children is our focus.  Continuing care is imperative and graduates are provided with support services on an ongoing basis and may always come back for assistance.  Chrysalis House is making a difference in so many ways! Graduates are staying sober, working in jobs that support their families, earning their GEDs, living in their own homes, and giving back to their community as their lives come full circle.";"http://www.chrysalishouse.org/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/ChrysalisLex";"Tuesday 12am (midnight) – 8am

As a parent, you want nothing more than the best for your child.  It is always a comfort to know while you have to be away from your loved ones that they are in good hands.  At Lexington Baptist Temple Daycare, our staff is committed to providing top quality care in a loving, Christian environment.  LBTDC strives to be a ""home away from home"" for you child while you have to be away.  We see childcare as a partnership with the home, and seek to stay in close communication with parents and guardians on a daily basis regarding your child's educational and social progress.  Come by or request a tour today and discover the difference at LBT Daycare.
Quality Staff Makes A Difference.
The staff at LBT Daycare are committed to excellence.  Each teacher and staff member has either obtained or is pursuing advanced continuing education credentials through the Kentucky Child Development Associates Program, which is a hands on higher-level training program where staff are taught the fundamentals of child development, child safety, teaching techniques and enhanced communication skills. 
Along with enhanced training, the majority of our staff have long tenures at our center.  This provides stability and ensures that your child will see a friendly familiar face for the years he or she is enrolled at LBTDC.  
Quality Teaching Makes A Difference.
LBTDC considers it a core value to be much more than just a ""babysitting service.""  For this reason, preschool education programs begin as early as 2 years of age in our center.  Each classroom operates on a daily structured schedule that integrates play, social skill enhancement, educational time and manipulatives (crafts & projects).  No child leaves a day at LBTDC claiming to be bored!
As students advance into our 4K program, they are introduced to the A Beka Course of Study.  A Beka is an accelerated academy-style curriculum that focuses on the foundational principles of mathematics, language, phonics, social studies, science and writing, as well as creative outlets and social skills.  Most of our outgoing students score beyond Kindergarten levels when entering elementary school after completing the 4K year.  
Quality Facilities Make A Difference.
LBTDC has 16,000 square feet of licensed space, as well as two outdoor play structures and a gymnasium which keeps kids active during the cold winter months indoors.  Each classroom is outfitted with age-appropriate fixtures, play items and educational materials, and our commercial kitchen allows our chef to prepare delicious, fresh meals each day which meets all the standards of the state and federal foodservice programs.";"http://www.lexingtonbaptisttemple.org/daycare.html";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

The first director of the Day Care Center was Sr. Mary Mercy an Ursuline Sister.  The Day Care was located in the west wing of the school building.  In 1989, the Kindergarten Program was taken over by the Owensboro Catholic Consolidated School System. 

When Sr. Mary Mercy retired in 1978,  Ms. Juanita Fogle became Director and served in that capacity until June, 2003.  Micki Brantley Howard is the current director of the day care center.  The Day Care Center has recently expanded its services to include infants and toddlers.  The Day Care Center has an outstanding reputation as a Christian based, quality child care center that strives to meet the needs of parents and children.   Referrals for Day Care Services can be made by contacting the Day Care at 684-7456.  Days and hours of operation are Monday - Friday,  6:30 A.M. - 5:30 P.M.

Day Care Advisory Council:   The Day Care Advisory Council was formed in 2003.  Additional volunteers with an interest in this ministry are needed.   Nine individuals will serve as the Advisory Council with each serving a three year term.  Advisory Council members are appointed by the Pastor.";"http://www.stpiustenthparish.org/day_care/index.html";;"Monday - Friday,  6:30 A.M. - 5:30 P.M.";"http://www.stpiustenthparish.org/day_care/index.html";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.stpiustenthparish.org/images/daycare/header.jpg";;;;;;

As the principal of SOES, it is my responsibility to ensure that we are indeed doing just that!  I believe we must celebrate and cultivate the whole child.  Therefore, our emphasis at SOES is to build knowledge through many avenues.  Each child has a strength that we need to find and capitalize on so that each and every child feels successful at school.

To do this, we need to not only focus on our teaching, but on our student’s learning as well.  We will implement the use of specific learning targets in our classroom and the use of specific feedback on student work.  We will celebrate small successes each day through Stallion Salutes.  We will offer a club day each month to give students the opportunities to explore and find new areas of interest and strengths. In addition to Club Day, we will offer after school clubs such as Art Club, Archery Club, Running Club and Lego Club. 

Our staff believes in our mission and pledges to give 100% each day to celebrate the Success Of Every Student!";"http://www.daviesskyschools.org/school_home.aspx?schoolID=17";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Cook, superintendent of Christian County schools, held a meeting in the Sinking Fork area to discuss the possibility of consolidating three schools. In the fall of that same year an attractive four room building had been constructed and two buses had been purchased to transport students.

Sinking Fork school held its first high school graduation in 1926. In 1939 a gymnasium was built and in 1941 a modern brick building was constructed around the gymnasium. In 1951 a new wing of classrooms was added and another wing in 1954. In 1959 students in the 10th, 11th and 12th grades were moved to the high school on Glass Avenue in Hopkinsville. Ninth grade students were moved to the high school in 1969. By 1991 all 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students were moved to middle schools in Hopkinsville.

Sinking Fork Elementary moved to a new building in the fall of 1998. Students in preschool through fifth grade attend. ";"http://sinkingfork.christian.kyschools.us/";;"7:20am-2:20pm";;;"http://sinkingfork.christian.kyschools.us/?PageName=%27Handbook%27";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

Philosophy:  Southside Preschool joins with the Christian family to provide for the individual needs of each child entrusted to our care.  We strive to focus on the individual needs of each child in the light of God’s Word.  We desire for each child to learn about Jesus and how HE wants us to live.

Curriculum:  We believe that young children learn best by doing.  Children are taught from the biblically based Abeka curriculum.  This curriculum is based on the understanding that young children’s play is their “work”.  Southside Preschool trains children to develop through a balance of child-initiated and teacher directed activities to help prepare the children for future academic growth and development.  Many other resources are used to make sure your child has a good beginning.";"http://www.southsidebaptist.com/Preschool";;"6:30 AM – 4:30 PM";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

For part of the hour they will join together in our worship room to sing and study our story.  This hour uses Lifeway’s Bible Studies for Life Digital Curriculum.  Each week they will play games, hear the Bible story in a unique way, and study lesson with Brianna and Simon (who our kids know as the stinky sock).

In 1964, the Federal Government asked a panel of child development experts to draw up a program to help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. The panel report became the blueprint for Project Head Start.

Project Head Start, launched as an eight-week summer program by the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1965, was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing preschool children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional and psychological needs. Recruiting children age three to school age entry, Head Start was enthusiastically received by educators, child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the Nation.

In 1969, Head Start was transferred from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Office of Child Development in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and has now become a program within the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Head Start has evolved into a program that provides education, health and social services. Education includes preschool education to national standards that have become de facto standards for all U.S. preschools. Health services include screenings, health check–ups, and dental check–ups. Social services provide family advocates to work with parents and assist them in accessing community resources.

KRFDC’s Head Start program began in 1966. The earliest records indicate that in 1974 Head Start was funded at $435,424 and served 330 children (95 in Clark, 60 in Estill, 115 in Madison, and 60 in Powell County. At the time, the program employed 73 people.

Since 1966, KRFDC Head Start services have expanded into Garrard, Jackson, Laurel, and Rockcastle counties. In 2009 KRFDC Early Head Start was funded to serve children in Clark, Estill, Madison, and Powell counties.

Today, KRFDC’s Head Start funding is $6.7 million to provide Head Starts services to 856 children ages 3-4 in Clark (210), Estill (53), Garrard (46), Jackson (102), Laurel (117), Madison (175), Powell (128), and Rockcastle (25) counties; as well as Early Head Start services to 84 children birth-3 years-old in Clark (10), Estill (8), Madison (38), and Powell (28) counties. Currently, the program employs 115 people.";"http://www.foothillscap.org/Services/HeadStartLocations.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kentucky-River-Foothills-Head-Start/732197740195838";;"http://www.foothillscap.org/JobOpportunities/JobOpportunities.html";"http://www.foothillscap.org/Services/HeadStartHowtoEnroll.html";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.foothillscap.org/Services/Images/foothills-logo2.png";;;;;;

Our child centered environment focuses on the development of the whole child. By nurturing the natural curiosity found in children, and guiding them to explore their creative potential, we have the privilege of watching them grow intellectually, socially, emotionally, and spiritually.

At Georgetown Baptist Preschool we make it our commitment to offer a wide variety of readiness experiences which help foster a love of learning that lasts a lifetime. Through music, movement, language, art, dramatic play, science, math, and literacy activities, children are given opportunities to increase independence and self-expression.
 
With a presence in the community for over 25 years, Georgetown Baptist Preschool prides itself on developing lasting relationships with the families we serve. When you enroll in our preschool, you become a part of a community of caring individuals offering support, encouragement, and friendship. Thanks to the many who continue to make our school a place where families and staff can learn and grow with one another.

The ministry quickly recognized that a critical step on the road to steady employment and family stability was reliable and affordable childcare.
 
God's Little Lambs now provides childcare largely for children from low-income families, allowing mothers and fathers to work, save money and support their families. Most children in low-income families have parents who are employed, but generally lower-income employees pay a higher share of their pay for childcare than upper-income families. Lower-income workers often have no paid leave. Today, qualifying families pay on a sliding scale and tuition is supplemented with scholarships.
 
The God's Little Lambs SERVE Team at Christ Church, led by George and Karen Hunsaker, wants to grow so there are more regular volunteers to read, interact with, and share easy craft projects with these precious children. Other opportunities to serve are available throughout the year. ";"http://www.echristchurch.org/GLL";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

We strive to provide a fun, loving and enjoyable atmosphere for your children.

Students are provided with a nutritional snack and drink after school, followed by a quiet, structured homework period. During this time, a majority of the students are able to complete all of their homework, study, work on school projects, read, and complete IXL assignments. The children are divided into groups according to age to better facilitate homework time.

After homework is completed the students are taken outside for supervised free play. This involves foursquare, basketball, pretend play, chalk art, soccer and simply socializing with friends. This is a relaxed, fun time. During inclement weather, the children can play in the gym, where they are provided with basketballs, jump ropes etc. We also provide many indoor activities in the school including puzzles, games, play-dough, painting, movies and supervised computer time.

For more information contact Heather Long at the YMCA.

Our pre-school program is located at First Baptist Church of Mayfield. We follow the Graves County School Calendar and operate from 7:00am to 5:30pm. We have a cap of 20 children as we believe that it is important for a smaller child to teacher ratio in order to prepare our pre-schoolers for Kindergarten.

We presently enroll children ages 2 to 5 years old. The Montessori curriculum and environment permits the child to learn at his or her own pace while fostering confidence and independence that will inspire a life- long love of learning.

Heartland Montessori School is a private Montessori School for children 2 to 5 years of age and serves students in the greater Hardin County area. We believe that each child should be loved and appreciated as an individual and that learning is best achieved within a loving, positive social atmosphere that nurtures and facilitates each child's unique development. We offer an encompassing curriculum by providing a strong academic foundation with important aesthetic experiences. Our ultimate goal is to encourage children to become responsible citizens who have the ability and desire to fulfill lifetime educational and social goals.";"http://www.heartlandmontessori.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heartland-Montessori-School/219163391448603";;;"http://www.heartlandmontessori.com/HMS-Enrollment.asp";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

We are distinctively classical in approach, meaning we see learning as integrated, hands-on, and oriented towards developing students’ abilities to think critically, communicate persuasively, and live virtuously.

More importantly, however, Trinity’s entire culture is thoroughly integrated around a Christian worldview. Many Christian schools claim this as a core value, but a scan of our curriculum and a visit to our community will reveal the significance this carries in our approach. The Christian worldview teaches all truth is God’s truth; skillfulness is worthless without moral grounding (the ability to know and live a good life); and every student has been given both a particular calling and set of gifts from God to utilize for the common good and for His glory. This shapes the unique nature of our educational community, which is to help students discover more and more of God, His world, themselves, and their part in His Grand Story.";"http://www.trinitylex.org/about-trinity/contact-us/";;"8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.";"http://www.trinitylex.org/about-trinity/employment-opportunities/";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

We have a camera system which allows our parents to log in and view the daycare online. This allows for an ease of mind during the day.

It is going to be an exciting year ahead. We look forward to working together to ensure our students are college, career, and citizenship ready for their futures.

The finishing touches are being put on our beautiful new building. Our gym is already decked out in red, white, and blue. We are named for the Honorable Representative Jody Richards, so we have chosen these patriotic colors as our new school colors. The students have voted for the Rockets as this new mascot!  

We plan to communicate, connect, and celebrate with students and families during this transition time. We will be using this website and emails as our way of communicating unless we know a family needs a hard copy mailed to them. Please visit this site often as we will be adding many updates.


To start making connections and celebrate our new building, we are planning many family events to help us join together as a new school community.  Part of this goal is for the students to become very comfortable with the physical space before the school year actually begins in August.  Therefore, several exciting evenings are being planned for the next few months. The first was a special Scavenger Hunt of Jody Richards Elementary on March 13th which was a huge success!   We will have other events throughout the summer.

The future of Jody Richards Elementary School is wide open!  We know the students will continue to grow and achieve as we work to maintain the high standard of excellence already established at both Rich Pond and Natcher.  We look forward to this exciting adventure of becoming the new Jody Richards’ school community. We welcome your participation as we prepare our future leaders.
