Reaching the Whole Child through the Reggio Approach

Community Preschool is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. We use the term “inspired” because we see this Italian approach as a fascinating guide rather than a curriculum blueprint. We feel that our values of education, childhood, and community are deeply reflected in the Reggio Emilia approach and we hope to use that as a basis for our ever-evolving program. As staff, we are continuously learning with the children, with parents, and with other early childhood educators to gain a deeper understanding of education.

We offer an emergent curriculum that allows for flexibility, spontaneity, and in-depth exploration. It is most often child-directed and teacher-guided. This means that teachers offer provocations to stimulate the learning process, allowing children to investigate their own interests and theories. Sometimes these explorations turn into long-term projects where children experience the research process of questioning, hypothesizing, testing theories, learning from experts (ie: parents, community members, books), and exploring ideas through symbolic languages. Through these child-initiated experiences, children learn a variety of concepts and skills that will stay with them throughout their lives. Not only do they develop skills in literacy, art, science, and math, but they also develop the ability to communicate, to collaborate, and to think critically. We believe that children have the right to an educational program that values and nurtures these skills.";"http://www.communitypreschools.com/";;"8:30am-4:30pm";;"http://communitypreschools.com/blog/enrollment-and-wait-list/";"http://communitypreschools.com/blog/enrollment-and-wait-list/parent-handbook/";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://communitypreschools.com/blog/wp-content/themes/atahualpa/images/logo.gif";"http://communitypreschools.com/images/top_image_small.jpg";"http://communitypreschools.com/blog/?getfile=111";"http://communitypreschools.com/blog/?getfile=47";"http://communitypreschools.com/blog/?getfile=117";;

Since 1982, founders Frances Alascano and Amy Brown have dedicated their professional careers to the field of education and the creation of a unique and exceptional school.

We have gathered a team of dedicated teachers with appropriate credentials who share our vision of education. The curriculum and textbooks observable in all classrooms reflect the standards established by the State of California. Each teacher is responsible to be knowledgeable on grade level standards, and to challenge students to exceed all benchmarks. In addition to an excellent faculty, and the commitment to California State Standards, the Phoenix mandates small group teaching as the primary tool of effective instruction. In each classroom, students are arranged in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups to facilitate the teacher in meeting individual needs.

All students enjoy the enrichment program that the Phoenix Ranch School offers. Music classes are presented to all grades. Spanish and physical education classes for students in kindergarten through middle school are part of the core curriculum. A qualified teacher conducts each program, using quality materials and supplies. Our school facility includes comfortable and well-equipped classrooms (incorporating computer technology), a library, play equipment, basketball court, swimming pool, playing fields, outdoor lunch areas, and more.

Small group instruction within the classroom allows your child the necessary teacher interaction needed for success. Classroom size is limited to 12:1 in preschool, 20:1 in lower division (kindergarten through second grade), 22:1 (third through fifth grade) and 24:1 in middle school (sixth through eighth grade).

The Phoenix offers a myriad of programs to meet the needs of our students and families. Extended care hours assist working parents, and winter, spring, and summer day camps present families with wonderful options during times when school is out of session. Lunch and snacks are provided for students in preschool and an option to purchase lunch is available for all students in kindergarten through eighth grade. After-school activities are abundant and include workshops and sports leagues, as well as participation in our school orchestra or choir.

The Phoenix Ranch Summer Day Camp is an outstanding program for children ages 5-13 years old. Well-supervised activities include go carting, sports, archery, crafts, ceramics, swimming and more.

If children are given a variety of activites to choose from, ranging from fine motor play to large motor play, and fantasy play, music and the discovery of nature, they will choose the kind of play that. feeds and fosters their own personal growth. Young children should not be forced to sit down and work on writing letters and numbers, when what they want to do is build sand castles and ride bikes. At Rocking Horse Ranch, they will be constantly exposed to letters and numbers and other concepts within the framework of our thematic curriculum, and will pick up that knowledge as they are ready. Children learn from their play. Each form of play is a building block on which all of their elementary school work will be based. Until a child has satisfied himself/herself in one phase of development, they cannot successfully move on to the next. Children instinctively know what they need to work on, and as long as there is a wide variety of activities to choose from, their choices need to be respected. We truly trust that each child will successfully move through their pre-kindergarten stages of development if they are in an atmosphere of support and stimulation. And that is our job. We give children the opportunity to feel successful at whatever they attempt. With each accomplishment, children gain more and more confidence to tackle more and more challenges. Building a-positive self-image is probably our most important task . When a child has that, there is nothing they can’t do!

Trinity Christian School was first established as a Preschool in 1969. Ten years later in 1979 an Elementary School was added. Our Junior High was added in 2004. TCS provides a Christ-centered learning environment teaching an integrated Biblical Christian world view.

Small class sizes and a beautiful campus centrally located on top of a hill draw families from all over east county.

Curriculum includes a phonics-based early reader program, integrative technology and stimulating after school clubs. Moral character and leadership development are encouraged through chapels, student council and a dedicated staff.

Our instruction supports our ESLR's (Expected Schoolwide Learning Results). Each student is challenged to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ, a responsible learner, a critical thinker, an effective communicator, and a person of strong, Christ-like character.

Trinity Christian School recognizes that God created the whole child, body, soul, and spirit. We believe that the education process is dependent upon this basic philosophy in providing the right viewpoint, basic truths, principles for interpreting life, and the study of all subjects. We desire to teach that all truth is God's truth, that Jesus Christ is central in the truth, and the Holy Spirit is the discerner of the truth.

Our school opened in 1958 and is named for a career oil man who dedicated much of his life to supporting and nurturing the development of boys and girls through youth clubs and the currently operational R.M. Pyles Boys Camp located in the High Sierras. Robert M. Pyles was a kind man who continually demonstrated genuine concern for others. Currently, we serve a diverse population of approximately 800 students and their families.

We are very proud of our school and staff. Our talented teachers have met California Teaching Criteria and are considered ""highly qualified"". To support students who are learning English, we have a team of dedicated bilingual Para-Educators who work with individuals and small groups. We strive for excellence in all that we do! Teachers use research based ""best practices"" to meet the rigor of the California Standards. Teachers are also supported by our ambitious and energetic Instructional Practices Coach and English Learner Coach. Through the Panther Tutoring Program (PTP), we offer before and after-school intervention for students needing additional support in Language Arts and Mathematics.

Exemplary behavior and good character is expected each and every day at RMP! In order to achieve this goal, we follow our Panther P.A.W.S. rules. P - Proud, A - Always respectful, W - Working hard, S - Safe. Students who demonstrate excellent Panther behavior are rewarded with Panther PAWS tickets which are used for a weekly raffle for prizes donated by the local business and community members.

We are pleased to have the support of our parents who are involved in their children's education via participation in committees such as PTA, School Site Council (SSC) and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC). Additionally, families attend monthly recognition assemblies, grade level performances and family literacy and math nights. Finally, we enjoy a strong partnership with the City of Stanton and local businesses.

On behalf of the students and staff of Robert M. Pyles Elementary School, you are cordially invited to attend an activity or performance held on our campus. Come visit ""RMP, Home of the Panthers,"" so that you can fully appreciate all of the learning taking place here each and every day - you will be glad you did!";"http://www.msd.k12.ca.us/index.php/schools/robert-m-pyles-rmp";;"8am-3pm";;;"http://www.msd.k12.ca.us/index.php/parents/2013-14-parent-student-handbook";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";;;;;;;

A wide assortment of courses is offered to meet the needs of all students, from support and intervention to Advanced Placement.  The school is also the home of the Career Pathway Program (formerly the Magnet Academy of Mathematics and Science) and five Smaller Learning Communities (SLCs).

Students at Edison have the opportunity to recover credit deficiencies through APEX, an online credit recovery program that is available on the campus after school.  AVID is another influential program on campus that has successfully prepared students for college year after year. 

The strong Edison athletic program and the YMCA program give students numerous opportunities to develop talents and interests outside the regular school day.  All extra-curricular enrichment activities help students make positive choices and focus on achieving both personal and academic goals. 

The faculty of Edison High is committed to providing meaningful educational opportunities to every student on campus.  We thank you for your interest in our school and in the welfare of the young adults we serve, whom we regard as Soul Vikes.

Dr. Maria Montessori was an Italian physician, educator, innovator and noted humanitarian, acclaimed for her educational method, that builds on the way children naturally learn. Her methods and educational materials, developed over a century ago, have withstood the test of time and are used in private and public schools throughout the modern world.

Many of today’s most successful people were Montessori educated. They include Sergey Brin & Larry Page (founders of Google), Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon.com), Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft). Others include, Anne Frank, Julia Child, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Sean “P Diddy” Combs, and Taylor Swift. These are only a few, the list goes on and can be easily researched.
The school is located off West Lane near Costco and Kaiser with easy access to Hammer Lane.  Our facility includes 3 playgrounds and a large indoor play space. Classroom areas are bright, spacious and colorful.  We provide a separate, supervised room with soft music and dim lighting for napping. Older children have afternoon class time from 1:00 to 4:00 pm. Children who nap rejoin their class upon waking.";"http://stocktonstanfordmontessori.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/stockton.montessori";;;"http://stocktonstanfordmontessori.com/?page_id=439";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://stocktonstanfordmontessori.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A-Stockton_Tahoma-7B1.jpg";"http://stocktonstanfordmontessori.com/wp-content/gallery/home/dscn0468.jpg";"http://stocktonstanfordmontessori.com/wp-content/gallery/home/dscn0436.jpg";"http://stocktonstanfordmontessori.com/wp-content/gallery/home/dscn0440.jpg";;

Children at play are actively involved in creating themes, exploring and establishing environments, solving problems and developing shared understandings.

The more creative their play, the more opportunities they have to learn. Children thrive when they have choices to make in their learning. We facilitate children's choices within a carefully planned environment. We create the environment to allow each child, ages 2 to 5, to choose activities that are developmentally appropriate for his or her age. Our teachers offer a variety of learning experiences by setting up a creative environment filled with choices including, art, music, stories, reading readiness, number concepts, small and large muscle development, dramatic play, language development, social skills and so much more!

Our staff, community and students work together to encourage responsibility, integrity and an enthusiasm for learning. Our primary mission is to provide a quality educational program to all students in a safe, caring and supportive environment.
Truckee Elementary  became the district’s first “green” school starting in 2012 with the help of our  PTO, the district, and the Shane McConkey Foundation as well as many community partners, including Sierra Watershed Education Partnerships.
Along with being the first TTUSD school site for composting, using reusable trays in the cafeterias, and testing energy-saving light bulbs and hand dryers, our Green Team students are continually brainstorming ways that we can reduce energy consumption and waste. Students actively participate in recycling, reusing, and composting.  They see real results while learning about science, the environment, and becoming models of environmental stewardship for our schools, their families, and the community.
Our students also participate in many outside of school learning experiences, including fine art and music events, thanks to support from Measure A. Our active and strong PTO works hard to provide even more hands-on learning opportunities. Truckee Elementary students recently participated in the Tahoe Food Hub’s Grow Dome Harvest. Currently, Truckee’s PTO is fundraising with the goal of purchasing a Grow Dome near the school where students can plant, care for, and harvest their own food using their own compost from the school, further incorporating science and nutrition into their daily studies.
Parents play a very important role at Truckee Elementary through their active participation in the Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO), the School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), and in our important parent volunteer program. Nearly 60% of our parents volunteer in the classroom, as tutors, sources of transportation for field study trips and extra hands helping students work on special projects and activities supporting our academic curriculum.";"http://te.ttusd.org/pages/Truckee_Elementary";;"9:05am-3:15pm";;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://te.ttusd.org/dynimg/_zDAAA_/docid/0x09DA063A60524424/8/TruckeeElementaryLogo1.png";"http://te.ttusd.org/files/_tWDZt_/76e34502581c139f3745a49013852ec4/truckee-elem-middle-pic.jpg?isPlacedWithSiteDesigner=true";"http://te.ttusd.org/dynimg/_zDAAA_/docid/709886845856558050/ea/false/cci/1396584287887";;;;

Currie’s school wide implementation of Positive Behavior Intervention Support has reduced its office referrals and truancy rate over the past 3 years. This year Cougars and Panthers return to school with a new motto and core values.  Big Cats are ALERT!  ALERT stands for Attentive, Likeable, Eager, Reliable, and Thoughtful.  As students apply these core values in all areas, they will continue to find success in their personal and academic endeavors.

When Currie Middle School and Thorman Elementary School were built in 1973, they were one school.  Forty years later, we now operate as one school once again.  Mrs. Christine Matos will serve as principal of the Currie/Thorman schools, and our students are lucky to have two assistant principals on campus, Mrs. Heather Bojorquez (Jenkins) and our new assistant principal, Mrs. Kimberly Thompson.  Please be sure to introduce yourself and welcome Mrs. Thompson to the Currie/Thorman community.

Because we believe that your child has been hand-crafted by God with his or her own set of talents and strengths, we have moved beyond a “one size fits all” philosophy.  We understand that children learn differently; one child might be an auditory learner, while others are visual or tactile learners.   In order to accommodate these different learning styles, our teachers have been trained to employ multiple, creative teaching techniques. We know that this one important action will provide an equal opportunity for each of our students to succeed and grow. Our belief that learning should be fun motivates us to continually create new “learning through play” concepts, which keep our kids engaged and our program fresh and vibrant.  We believe that learning is a life-long adventure and that the world is an amazing place with new and exciting discoveries around every corner.  We hope to inspire our students to fall in love with learning and grow in their imagination.

Safety is our first priority at Mountain Green Preschool and we take security very seriously.  All teachers and support staff are clearly identified by the bright green aprons worn at all times, as well as the official name badges issued by the school.  Exterior doors of the school building remain locked during school hours and visitors much check in at the front office.  The parking areas for the campus are clearly visible to our front office staff and every visitor is greeted immediately upon arrival.  We currently use mounted cameras to monitor the school grounds and we have plans to install several new cameras this year.";"http://mtgreenchristianschool.com/";;" 6:30 AM – 6:00PM";;"http://mtgreenchristianschool.com/registration/";;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://mtgreenchristianschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Soccer-Shots-2-470x290.jpg";"http://mtgreenchristianschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Healthy-Teeth-470x290.jpg";"http://mtgreenchristianschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Soccer-Shots-470x290.jpg";"http://mtgreenchristianschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Feature-Game-Kids.jpg";;

The program was created in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty. The program was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing a comprehensive program that would meet the emotional, health, nutritional and psychological needs of preschool children from low-income and disadvantaged families. Our central premise is that “family” is the most fundamental factor influencing the lives of children. Aside from children’s educational needs, they also need a supportive, healthy home environment combined with stable and reliable relationships with adults and caregivers. In short, if you strengthen families, you automatically strengthen children.";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/";;;"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/employment/Default.aspx";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/enrollment/Default.aspx";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_home/Logo_rtPhoto.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos_2kids.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos_girl.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos_volunteer.jpg";;

We strive to provide a loving, nurturing, and creative environment for all children. Our philosophy is based upon the principal that play is a significant mode of learning. Therefore, in our curriculum planning we strive to provide developmental appropriate experiences that encourage growth cognitively, emotionally, socially, creatively, physically, and spiritually leading to a strong sense of self-esteem within each child.

     We believe in providing a physical environment that is safe, clean, and healthy and child friendly. Classrooms are arranged to offer challenging play and learning choices at a range of developmental levels. Learning centers allow children the opportunity to explore, to experience, and most importantly…to succeed. Various centers include areas for creative expression through art, music, and crafts; role-playing, dramatic play and socialization; story telling; story writing; language development; and the development of pre-reading and pre-math skills.

     We know that outdoor experiences are vital to the growth and development of children as well. These experiences include sand and water play, arts and crafts, riding toys, climbing structures and a variety of choices, which foster large muscle skills. We also introduce teamwork experiences in the form of small and large muscle activities.

     The strength of our program is the experience, expertise, and dedication of our staff. We support the teachers with training, resources and the freedom to create a unique learning environment. We provide many opportunities for the teachers to share ideas and grow professionally. Our teachers create a caring and nurturing atmosphere that fosters each child’s creativity and positive self-image.

     We believe in positive methods of discipline. We establish consistent and appropriate limits to help children function in their world. Rather than being punitive, the goal of discipline in our program is to develop the child’s sense of independence and responsibility. We strive to strengthen each child’s own cultural identity while instilling a respect for others.";"http://churchofthechimes.org/Preschool_2.html";;"8:50 am -- 1:00 pm or

Each develops at his or her own particular pace, marching to the beat of their own distinct drum. An effective preschool program stays in step with the rhythms of each child, gently guiding toward security and sound development.

First Years offers a very personal program. It is designed to nurture each child through every aspect of development- emotional, social, physical and cognitive-at his or her own rate of readiness. We start with the cornerstone of separation and attachment. As parents, you are their safe haven, their protectors. We are new and unknown, often the first caretaker outside the home. It takes time for children to incorporate us into their internal circle of trust. At First Years we work step by careful step to provide a safe environment as children enter our program. Our goal is to have them move forward in independence while being supported by the familiar. Each child walks through this process along a path that is right for them. For some it occurs swiftly. For other it may take longer. There is no one right way.

Based on a philosophy that all children deserve a safe, supportive and nurturing environment that helps them develop physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively, the program encourages children from varying backgrounds to explore and discover through play as well as interactions with peers, adults and their surroundings.

In addition to serving low-income families, Early Learning Center also accepts applications from all families in the community who seek high quality childcare for toddlers and pre-K children. Tuition rates are reasonable and flexible schedules are available. Enrollment is limited, so waiting lists may apply.

St. Joseph Center Venice Early Learning CenterA key part of the Center’s model is its “dual-immersion” bilingualclassrooms. The opportunity to become bilingual early in life through a high quality bilingual learning environment will open up a new world of possibilities for every child enrolled. The diverse classrooms and the guidance of skilled teachers who are educated in Child Development, help the children at St. Joseph Center develop positive attitudes toward others who are different from themselves and enable children with diverse needs to better achieve their full potential.

A philosophy that values diversity and the development of the whole child, in combination with low teacher-to-child ratios, regular developmental assessments, an emphasis on family involvement, ongoing staff development, and comprehensive services for families who need extra help to maintain stability, makes St. Joseph Center’s ELC one of the best childcare providers in Venice.

Please drop in often for informal visits; you are always welcome.

The staff at Happy Ventures is very anxious to work with you to provide a nurturing learning environment for your child as he/she gains self-esteem. Many research studies have been completed which demonstrate the positive effects of parents involvement regarding children’s achievement, self-esteem, motivation, and language skills. The investigations show beneficial results for children, parents, and in some cases for younger siblings.

We look forward to involving you and your child in our program. Please check out the rest of the site as it contains a more in depth look into our philosophy, policies and organization; the experiences your child will have; and ways we can cooperate with each other to fulfill mutual goals.

Happy Ventures admits children who are 6 weeks old through age 5. The director leads each family through a number of steps prior to a child’s admission into the school. We hope that all parents will choose Happy Ventures Preschool because we represent their own philosophical beliefs regarding early childhood care and education. We allow an adjustment period of 6 weeks for the parents and teachers to assess whether the child’s needs can be met within the school environment.

Our three classes are broken up based on developmental readiness, rather than calendar age.﻿

﻿Here are some examples of what our Child-Centered Philosophy looks like:

    We do not have scheduled ""potty times"", when a child has to go, they are taken individually. 
    Not all children are required to nap; we have a ""non-nap"" group for those who have grown out of their naps to do quiet activities.  
    We encourage healthy eating but we do not say they have to ""clean their plate"". 
    Teachers encourage and teach problem solving at every level, and help the children to work out conflicts individually.
    The children go outside in cold, hot and sometimes sprinkling rain! Their need to run and move does not go away with weather changes, so we bundle up and take them out when they need it!
    ﻿We believe in developmentally appropriate curriculum, and do not expect long periods of sitting or quiet.

Children enrolled in the program gain proficiency in Spanish much in the same way they learn English or any native languageâ€”by integrating it into their lives on a daily basis. All of the instructors we hire are native speakers because the program emphasizes proper pronunciation and exposure to various aspects of Latin culture.

A team made up of experienced child care providers, a registered nurse, and the Center Director provides the comprehensive care that your child needs.  The California Department of Social Services licenses TodayCare Children’s Center.   John Muir Health subsidizes the cost of the programs as an employee benefit.  The types of care offered and descriptions are as follows:

v                 Transitional Child Care is for parents returning from maternity leave and/or who have recently adopted a child.  Transitional child care is available for up to 12 weeks upon their return to work. Care will be individualized to meet your child’s needs.  The transitional child care program also includes a comfortable area for mothers to nurse their infants.

v                 Back-up Care is for those days when your regular child care arrangements are not available.  Examples include school holidays or teacher in-service days; child care is closed; or your nanny is ill.  Employees are allowed 45 days per year (based on calendar year) to use Back-up care at their discretion.  The back-up program is based upon using creativity and imagination to stimulate and teach outside a normal developmental curriculum.  Your child will have the opportunity to paint, draw, build with blocks, play a board game, or even perfect their computer skills.  Children will also have the opportunity to play outdoors.   

v                 Mildly Ill Care is for days when your child has a mild illness or is recovering from a more serious illness.  For example, your child has a low grade fever, cold symptoms or earache, or he is recovery from a tonsillectomy.  A nurse will monitor your child’s condition and notify you of any changes while a child care provider comforts and entertains your child.  Mildly ill care is not limited, as long as the child and the illness meets our criteria. 

Our goal is to provide parents or guardians with a child care choice that is easy to make.  We will provide a safe and caring environment for your child when participation in the regular school or care routine is not possible and you still need to go to work.";"http://www.todaycare.com/john_muir";;"6:15 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday";;"http://www.todaycare.com/john_muir";"http://www.todaycare.com/john_muir/handbook";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";;;;;;;

At Happy Notes children study the Russian language and literature, become acquainted with the works of Russian writers and poets, and learn how to read and write. To test and reinforce their knowledge of Russian language, our students write vocabulary dictation, perform grammar exercises on selected topics, practice writing from memory, and short compositions. Such assignments expand the ability of the children to intelligently build phrases and sentences, develop oral and written speech, and help in the overall development of our students.

For those interested in playing musical instruments, we offer classes in piano, violin, and guitar. Furthermore, our Music Literature class introduces our students to masterpieces of classical music. For the youngest in our school we provide the class “I, Mom and Music.”

The school is geared for children between the ages of four and twelve years old. Your child will have a unique opportunity to take part in productions of Children’s Musicals: participate in vocal lessons, dancing, and acting. These experiences will help your child in building his or her self-confidence and practice their team-work skills.

The school operates on Saturdays from 10am to 2pm. This time frame includes four 45minute lessons and a short break. There are four age groups of up to ten students. Such group formation provides for individual approach toward each child, yet simultaneously allows the child to grow within a team.";"http://www.happynotes.org/home/";;"Saturdays from 10:00am to 2:00pm.";;;;"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.happynotes.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/22222222.png";"http://www.happynotes.org/wp/wp-content/gallery/day-care/MG_8790-to-print-for-e-mail1.jpg";"http://www.happynotes.org/wp/wp-content/gallery/day-care/Detki-3.jpg";"http://www.happynotes.org/wp/wp-content/gallery/day-care/DSC03417.JPG";"http://www.happynotes.org/wp/wp-content/gallery/home/musicalkids_musical-school.jpg";;

Child development is a complex, continuous process involving both natural characteristics and environmental influences. Children progress in predictable steps, achieving successively higher and more complex levels of development. Children share certain characteristics, but each child is also unique. Children thrive in the combined influences of caring adults, and a consistent, predictable environment.

Our program philosophy, goals, and objectives address all aspects of child development, including their social, emotional, cognitive, language, and physical needs.

Demand for Pre-school's continue to grow day by day, but all too often, institutions are only able to focus on either allowing the child to enjoy their childhood and develop naturally or forcing the child to focus only on mental development in order to achieve high test scores later on in life.
At Cornerstone we believe a healthy mix of both is necessary in order for your child to continue to grow into a well rounded individual . We promote physical activities in large open areas and a wide variety of educational games, but we also have a small library and various arts and crafts for your child to unleash his or her full creative and intellectual potential.

It provides the students with the District curriculum and believes that all students can learn. Each child is considered as an individual with his/her own needs and potential. Staff development provides teachers with more knowledge and a better understanding of the special needs of students.

One of our school wide goals is that all children who have been at West Whittier since kindergarten will be reading at grade level by the end of third grade. To support this, all teachers and support staff have received additional training on reading strategies and differentiated instruction. Our categorical budget has been developed to target expenditures that will support our students where they need it most. A reading support teacher, instructional assistants, additional books and other instructional materials are just a few of the items that have been provided for our students out of our categorical budget. Technology continues to be another area where we believe our students need to learn more about. We have purchased new iMacs for our library to help our students research material on the Internet for reports. We have also bought individual word processors called Alphasmarts that will help our students with their classroom writing projects. In addition, several software programs have been purchased to provide additional help in language arts and math.

The staff recognizes parents as partners in the education of their children. The staff and parents continuously work to assess and improve the instructional program. Family nights in the areas of literacy and math have provided our students and parents with an opportunity to learn together in a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere. We will continue to provide opportunities for parents to become involved with their child’s education.

The school also focuses on the students’ development of a positive self-concept, respect for themselves and others and the responsibility for their own actions. We have also provided after school programs that help our students develop other talents in the areas of dance, art and sports. By providing all of these programs and experiences, it is our hope that our students will be able to flourish both academically and socially.";"http://whittier-wcsd-ca.schoolloop.com/";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"http://whittier-wcsd-ca.schoolloop.com/uimg/image/1296917145899/1296917141108/1312697422482.png";;;;;;

To encourage children to become independent ajnd develop an appreciation for the rights and needs of others and to help each child develop an awareness of him/herself with confidence in their abilities.

For the parent: To help parents better understand their child’s development and aid them in their role as parents.

Your child will discover aptitudes, abilities, and areas of success. Students will be free to respond with wonder and interest to the beautiful unusual, and the dependable in the world.

Our school uses developmentally appropriate teaching practices along with an environment that’s designed to provide a variety of sensory experiences in an aesthetically pleasing manner using both indoors and outdoors as learning space. Classrooms are light and bright, with large windows that open to the playground and patio areas. Items found in nature are incorporated into the classroom. Materials are considered an important part of developing an appreciation for the work around us. Teachers carefully arrange the room and display all material so that children can make thoughtful decisions when working and exploring. We consider our classroom environment to be as much of a teaching tool as the teachers themselves. Our curriculum will provide opportunities for new adventures into discovering and increasing independence. Developed skills include: but are not limited to, oral language, perception, matching, sound, letters, colors, sequencing and relationships.

Our primary goal is to help your children become happy, productive people, and to provide an atmosphere where children experience being loved, understood, and accepted by trustworthy and dependable people who care for them personally. The program is supervised at all times by an experienced staff. We feel that the children should come first with the parents coming in at a close second.";"http://www.napsinc.org/";;;;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.napsinc.org/img/logo.png";"http://www.napsinc.org/img/dragonflies.jpg";"http://www.napsinc.org/img/butterflies.jpg";"http://www.napsinc.org/img/owls.jpg";"http://www.napsinc.org/img/frogs.jpg";;

The program was created in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty. The program was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing a comprehensive program that would meet the emotional, health, nutritional and psychological needs of preschool children from low-income and disadvantaged families. Our central premise is that “family” is the most fundamental factor influencing the lives of children. Aside from children’s educational needs, they also need a supportive, healthy home environment combined with stable and reliable relationships with adults and caregivers. In short, if you strengthen families, you automatically strengthen children.";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/";;;"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/employment/Default.aspx";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/enrollment/Default.aspx";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_home/Logo_rtPhoto.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos_2kids.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos_girl.jpg";"http://hss.sbcounty.gov/psd/images_inside/slice4kidphotos_volunteer.jpg";;
