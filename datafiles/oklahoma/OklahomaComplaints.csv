We checked the fence for holes, slats missing, we could not find anything. I had a professional come out to check and see if they could find anything missing, or if they could see how a child could have left the playground. They could not find anything. At this point we began to look at areas of concern. The first area was by the sheds on the playground we noticed that if a child would go to this area to play they would be out of view to the staff. We immediately put up a fence connecting the sheds on the playground. The second step was accountability, every child on the playground must be accounted for every 15 minutes. If the class is on the playground for 30 minutes, then the teacher must show on their sheet that she checked and accounted for each child twice. The third step was cameras, we added two cameras to the playground, we can view the playground at several different angels. This will help to ensure the staff are monitoring the children and supervising their activities. The next step was communication, every staff must check out a radio when they clock in, and prior to going to their assigned work areas. The fifth step for safety was to put a 6 ft. stockade fence around the two and three year old playground. This will prevent anyone having view of our children. The last step was to discipline the teacher involved who did not keep accountability of all the children, therefore the staff was suspended for two days without pay and removed from the classroom.
