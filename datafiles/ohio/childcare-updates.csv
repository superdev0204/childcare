We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

We may be a new local child care name in the community, but we have a lot of love, dedication and experience to give! We strive to be an extension of your child's home with a low teacher to student ratio. Small class sizes means more one on one attention for your child and the opportunity to see growth and development!

Your child will have plenty of room to explore and socialize with others while receiving one-on-one attention from our experienced instructors. We  offer child care services to children ages 6 weeks to 12 years old. Ask us about our competitive prices for this area, and how you can qualify for the Title XX program!

The needs of children and their parents are the primary concerns of Youthland Academy's child care philosophy. By providing the best possible daycare to children, we are contributing to the happiness and the security of their parents and to the community they live in.

First and foremost, Youthland Academy provides children constant and alert supervision in a safe environment, screened from hazards. The large classroom with designated area for learning centers provide for both quiet and active play. Our entire program is designed to enable children to have a positive self-concept and to know success and fulfillment through programs of positive self-concept and to know success from the beginning. This is possible because our Academy environment provides children the opportunity to be safe in their quest as natural leaders.

Youthland Academy isn't merely a childcare center, it's a ""learning center"" that assists children to realize success and fulfillment through programs of positive self-image. Children experience the joy of learning; they feel loved and accepted. Our program is our attitude.

Our Teachers and Directors are provided monthly themes that ignite each child's unique pleasure in learning. The monthly curriculum suggests proven ways to include these themes in a variety of ""discovery centered"" activities. Using the curriculum's themes, each teacher designs individualized lesson plans. We do not adhere to the standardized lesson plan because we feel there is no standard child or standard class. This is why we keep our teacher-child ratio at the level that comfortably supports personal attention.

Included with classroom discovery and stimulation are field trips. At some of our Academies, we also provide activities such as gymnastics and dance classes. These services enable parents to further enrich their children's lives without cutting into the quality time parents and children share after working hours.

Progress reports are given to parents to keep them up-to-date on the total growth of their children. Formal conferences are scheduled yearly to discuss a child's progress. However, parents are encouraged to meet their child's teacher and director, and visit the Academy at any time they feel necessary.";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/locations/west-carrollton-school-age";;"6:30am-2:00pm";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/careers";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/attachments/14/enrollment1.pdf";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/attachments/124/ParentHandbook2k14.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/138/content_1377348_10151877935546211_176283268_n.jpg";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/2/content_tod-cincinnati-day-care.jpg";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/141/content_426470_10151492431831211_1832794487_n.jpg";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/139/content_580490_10151499682281211_1585200262_n.jpg";;

YMCA programs and services have grown and adapted to the changing needs of families. Today, more and more parents are looking for quality, yet affordable childcare they can depend on. Whether your child is attending our infant/toddler program, preschool or our school age child care program, our goal is to provide a safe, fun environment. Like all Y programs, childcare is open to all.

With so many demands on today’s families, parents need all the support they can get. That’s why child care at the Y is about more than looking after kids. It’s about nurturing their development by providing a safe place for them to learn the foundational skills of Early Childhood Education, develop healthy, trusting relationships, and build self-reliance through the Y values. We believe the values and skills learned early on are vital building blocks for quality of life. The Preschool program is focused from the very beginning on Kindergarten readiness. We begin our Early Preschool program with our 2 ½ year olds. Our year-round curriculum includes thematic units that move the children through a progression of learning that can be adapted to meet the individual needs of the children at each level. Our facility allows us to provide the children breakfast, a full hot lunch and an afternoon snack as well as weekly swimming lessons and weekly gymnastics classes. We strive to educate the parent about the importance of their role in their child’s education from the very beginning. We keep parents informed through newsletters, scheduled and impromptu conferences, formal assessments and an open door policy that allows parents full view of what their child is involved in daily. We also encourage the parents to participate in family events throughout the year and to utilize our facility. A strong family relationship is vital to the ongoing education of our children, and we know that strong kids and strong families build strong communities.

We emphasize the four core values: caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility. We teach this to the children through day to day experiences, activities, and lessons. We give the children the opportunity to use verbal communication to solve problems. Our staff serves as positive role models and provides care that is supportive, nurturing, warm and responsive to each child's needs.  Our open door policy allows parents the freedom of knowing what their children are doing at all times during the day.

New friendships. New ideas. New ways to learn.

Welcome to the joys of childhood. Welcome to La Petite Academy.

What matters to us at La Petite Academy is simple: Your child. Here, exceptionally strong, sound social and educational foundations are formed. Here, children learn to respect one another. Learn together. Learn to work together. Learn to have fun constructively.

And discover how enjoyable learning can be.

It all starts by design. The free-flowing, open concept design of our facilities inspires a nurturing, interactive, and collaborative environment in which your child can thrive. Our schools and classrooms are designed to give children room to grow, room to share and room to be themselves. At La Petite Academy, open spaces and open concepts promote open minds.

In addition, our entire school is designed to ensure that your child’s safety and security remain our top priority. And communication is essential. With regular updates (including many photos) of your child’s experiences, you can feel comfortable that you are sharing this journey – every step of the way.

where children become numbers, yet run by a director committed to quality care.
In addition, Hilltop has multiple teachers that have not only years of experience
but degress in early childhood education. This experience creates a sense of family and
trust which resonates throughout the school.  I really can’t have imagined a better place
for my child to begin his formal education.  Lots of love, a little discipline,
plenty of playtime, creative projects, encouragement and understanding … time to be a child!";"http://hereforyoucdc.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://hilltopmonroe.com/images/HILLTOP_CHILDHOOD_Y.jpg";"http://hilltopmonroe.com/images/entry.png";"http://hilltopmonroe.com/images/nb_cc.jpg";"http://hilltopmonroe.com/images/t_cc.jpg";"http://hilltopmonroe.com/images/pK_cc.jpg";;

We value education and believe in partnering with the parents to  ​ensure a greater measure of success and growth. Our program strives to instill a higher education, biblical foundation, character, discipline, and creativity throughout the children in our care.   We currently use the Abeka and Pinnacle 
​curriculums which enhance our program and 
provide balance (both traditional learning 
and active participation) to every child.  
Children learn best when all five senses are 
applied to learning.  They enjoy the process 
and are not distracted by fear of the product 
that they are trying to achieve.  In additional 
to ​the curriculum, we desire to focus on the 
original grace, talent, and creativity that were 
given to them by God.  They are learning from 
​the inside out, encouraged to speak from their hearts, and have the freedom to be who they 
called to be!  A greater measure birthed within 
them can now be activated and developed in 
​the early years.";"http://www.godskidztoo.com/contact.html";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gods-Kidz-Too/139854126033018";"Mon - Fri:

1) We are a non-profit ministry- this means that the revenue generated by our program is invested into the lives of your children! We are here to make a difference in the lives of our families!

2) Our integrity- we believe in striving for excellence. We have a history of nearly flawless state licensing inspections because we endeavor to represent Christ in all that we do. 

3) We have a low staff turnover because we make careful selections in the hiring of our all Christian staff. Staff are encouraged to maintain their relationship with God and their roles as parents, spouses, children and friends in God's order of priority. We have several in-house teacher-aides that serve as substitutes at times- they are familiar with our children, our class routines and provide love and care for children in the absence of the lead teacher in each room.
   
4) Our experience- Our fourteen most senior employees have been here an average of over seven years. We LOVE what we do! Our newest staff members are selected because they FIRST have a love for children. Then education and experiences are considered in the selection and training processes. 
 
5) Our training- training is provided and paid for staff. Ongoing support in childhood development and classroom management is provided as staff mature. Staff are encouraged through tuition reimbursement to continue their professional growth. Many staff are degreed or have their Child Development Associates Degree (CDA) through the Council for Professional Recognition, Washington, DC. We have an on-staff advisor to make this process convenient for our staff. Through STEP UP TO QUALITY, our staff have access to scholarships that cover 90% of their college expenses! 

6) Our facility, including the full-sized gym, allows us plenty of space for exploring and experiencing fun ways to learn with our friends.

7) Our congregation supports Agape as an outreach ministry- we are not viewed as a ""profit machine"" to generate church income, but as part of the ministry of Dayspring.

8) We are privileged to be able to combine our call to ministry with our chosen vocation. Many people minister to children- we do it all week long!

9) Equipment purchases and supplies are a priority even though we do not charge as much as many other centers do. We want to meet the needs that staff have for classroom supplies and program materials. 

10) Our literacy based program provides many opportunities for child interaction with books- our teachers receive collections of library books monthly that change as our weekly themes change. This provides a rich and ever-changing resource for learning. Our K4 and preschool classes use a phonics-based reading curriculum that prepares them for a successful Kindergarten year.

Tuition for the two day a week program is $75 a month. Tuition for the three day a week program is $110 a month.

Ann's Bright Beginnings is Step Up to Quality approved. This means, simply, that we went 'one step above' licensing rules and regulations to be the best! We have lower staff/child ratios, a perfect inspection with cleanliness and orderly records, approved curriculum and better educated staff!

Head Start is a federally funded preschool specifically for low income children ages 3 to 5. 

Head Start is a national program that promotes school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. 

Head Start programs are operated by local organizations, usually nonprofits, but not always. Children who attend Head Start participate in a variety of educational activities. They also receive free medical and dental care, enjoy healthy meals and snacks, and play outdoors and indoors in a safe setting. Head Start centers are required to meet all State and local licensing regulations. 

Head Start provides children with activities that help them grow mentally, socially, emotionally and physically while assisting them with school readiness. 

The majority of the children served in Head Start are low income, below 130% of the national poverty guidelines. About ten percent of the children served may be above income and are selected based on need. 

Kno Ho Co Ashland CAC currently operates half day Head Start programs at all 5 locations. Children attend for 3.5 hours per day, for 128 days during a school year. Classes typically begin in September and last until mid-May. Classes are held Monday through Thursday with Fridays available to staff for training. 

Head Start teachers must have a degree in Early Childhood Education or a related field. Many of the teachers hold State of Ohio Teaching licenses. Assistant teachers must have a minimum of a CDA certificate, but many have taken college level classes in Early Childhood Education. 

Kno Ho Co Ashland CAC Head Start centers participate in the State of Ohio’s Step Up to Quality rating system. All centers have been rated as 4 stars.

Ashland County Head Start centers are located in the villages of Sullivan and Loudonville in Ashland County and in the City of Ashland. 

In Holmes County centers are located in the villages of Glenmont and Millersburg. 

Children with disabilities are welcome in the Head Start program and may receive special services or therapies. 

Some Head Start centers provide transportation by Licensed Ohio School Bus.";"http://www.knohoco.org/index.php/services/youth-services/head-start";;;;;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

At the Y, we believe the values and skills learned early on are vital building blocks for quality of life and future success.  That’s why our child care programs are staffed with people who understand the cognitive, physical and social development of kids, the need children have to feel connected and supported in trying new things, and the caring and reinforcement parents and families need to help each other. At the Y, babies develop trust and security, preschoolers experience early literacy and learn about their world, and school-age kids make friends, learn new skills and do homework.  Most importantly, children learn how to be their best selves. That makes for confident kids today, and contributing and engaged adults tomorrow.

The Ashtabula County YMCA offers preschool, academic preschool, kindergarten readiness, kindergarten extension, a before school program, an after school program, a school day off and snow day off program, and a summer day camp at the Y.  We also offer a before school and an after school program on site at Ridgeview Elementary School and on site at Kingsville Elementary School.

Our number one goal is to prepare children for kindergarten. Our curriculum takes into account the importance of social skills and group-work while focusing on the necessary educational skills. 
Head Start is available in either one of our centers or in your own home.

The Head Start Home Base option focuses on parents as educators and includes regular home visits by an assigned home visitor who works with families and supports parents in meeting the needs of their young children. Home Base is available anywhere in Washington or Morgan Counties. Our centers offer 3-½ hour classes four days a week and provide transportation where available, breakfast or lunch and a snack. Both of our options provide services for children with disabilities, family nights, parent groups and more.

Head Start teachers are constantly receiving the most current training in childhood education and development. We also work closely with the local school systems on many issues and have an on-going evaluation process that allows the teachers and parents to monitor the child's progress.

Program goals are set for improving the school readiness of children that align with the requirements and expectations of the schools. School readiness goals are the expectations that children's evolvement of language and literacy, cognition and general knowledge, approaches towards learning, physical well-being and motor development, and social and emotional development will improve children's' readiness for kindergarten.";"http://www.wmcap.org/headstart.html";;;"http://www.wmcap.org/employment.html";"http://www.wmcap.org/app_headstart.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.wmcap.org/_gfxredesign/topbar_left.gif";"http://www.wmcap.org/gfx-photos/service_headstart.jpg";;;;;

Children need to be presented with learning experiences and opportunities and they will soak up knowledge and continue to learn. Preschool education must offer a fine balance between ""structure"" and ""freedom of choice"". The child will be allowed to reach out to fulfill their natural curiosities and to explore the obvious. Our well educated staff will guide the child and direct them to grow by enhancing their experiences. BLC staff will offer the balance a child needs to feel secure and stable while attending our center. It is a known fact that all children will learn and progress at their own rate. Children, however, progress more rapidly if provided with the right stimulation and environment. Our center strives to offer the child a comfortable and secure environment that will stimulate and challenge the child to reach their full potential. We encourage children to make choices and to participate in group activities. We believe at Blanchester Learning Center, that early preschool years are very important for children to develop a strong self-image. We provide age appropriate opportunities for growth in self-direction and independence. We encourage self-expression, creativity, imagination, and above all, we want the children to feel safe and have fun learning. It is our goal for each and every child to look forward to attending our center. We also believe that the parents must feel confident and assured that their child will be cared for in an appropriate, nurturing and loving way. We encourage parents to get to know the staff and develop a strong partnership of Shared Care Giving with them. Thank you for sharing your child with us.";"https://www.facebook.com/BlanLearningCenter/info?tab=page_info";;"Mon - Fri:

During the morning children will begin in a large group setting where they will hear the bible verse, sing silly songs, learn fascinating facts and relish in the wonder of our world. Afterwards we will separate into age appropriate groups and explore through art, games, cooking and science stations  as we create, experiment, play and discover
    Full Day camps (9 a.m.-4 p.m) 1 $140 per week*  (includes 1/2 day camp)  Offered nine different weeks throughout the summer for children in K-5th grade.

Hundreds of children ages 18 months through 14 years have had the opportunity to enjoy learning, swimming, sports, trips, crafts, and much more in a Torah-true environment, supervised by counselors who are superb role models. Over the winter of 2007/8, Mrs. Pollock passed on the torch of leadership to Rabbi Shai Scherer, who is serving as the Camp’s Director. We are pleased that Mrs.Miriam Ottensoser will continue to direct our licensed toddler program. This summer the Pre-school is fortunate to have an experienced and talented new Head, Mrs. Kayla Berger. Rabbi Baruch Berger, our Elementary Boys head counselor, will continue to lead a fabulous program for boys entering 1st– 5th grade. Mrs. Chaya Spetner and Mrs. Chana Rochel Rabinowitz will also provide the girls entering 1st-6th grade with an outstanding experience.

We incorporate our mission of Growing Well-Rounded Kids by sharing the love of Jesus, following the example of Luke 2:52, where it says, “Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and men.” This means, Jesus grew intellectually, physically, spiritually and socially.  

CenterPoint Childcare is a place where children can grow likewise; with academic challenges, physical play, spiritual development, and relational learning. Children explore their God-given abilities in a loving, caring environment with a developmentally appropriate curriculum.  Each weekly theme, of our Christian curriculum,  includes  language arts, dramatic play, math, science, music and movement, fine and gross motor skills, sensory, and art enrichment activities. Each lesson is designed and focused on your child’s personal growth and development.";"http://centerpointchildcare.com/home/contact/";;" 7:00 AM-6:00 PM";"http://centerpointchildcare.com/home/cpcc-jobs/";;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://centerpointchildcare.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/0-6-26-100_7167.jpg";"http://centerpointchildcare.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0532.jpg";"http://centerpointchildcare.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/016A.jpg";"http://centerpointchildcare.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/018.jpg";;

We have been bring quality programs to the Grand Valley area since 2004. Choice Child Care is licensed by the state of Ohio to care for infants through school-aged children.  Before and after-school care is available with local school busing. The center also offers preschool and Pre-Kindergarten classes for children three through five years of age. Give us a call at (440) 437-7770 and we will be glad to answer your questions and/or arrange a tour of the center. 

    The large 5800 sq. ft. building was designed specifically for the care and teaching of young children. Each classroom is spacious and divided into clear individual learning centers holding a wide variety of materials. Every classroom has its own kitchenette area and is equipped with restrooms scaled to the size for the age group. The building is also equipped with an emergency monitoring system that is wired for fire and other emergency services. Exits are available out of every classroom directly to the large three acre playground. The outside environment has wide open areas of grass for ball play, mulch for climbing, and a pavilion for sun shelter.

    Your child’s safety is a primary concern and as a result we have equipped the building with a video monitoring system including a front entry-video camera.  Each classroom has a monitor displaying the front entrance and staff can release the locking mechanism from any classroom to allow authorized individuals to enter.

    The professional teaching staff has a wealth of experience. We emphasize the importance of quality care and are adamant about having low adult-to-child ratios and maintaining small group sizes. All programing is developmentally appropriate and focuses on the Early Learning Content Standards.

    We had an abundant of exciting activities through out the year that enhance our programs and tie in community involvement. To name a few of our annual visitors are Jungle Terry, the local fire department, paramedics. dental hygienists, and farmers. We recently purchased an activity bus making it possible for our school age group to travel to places such as Deer Park, Penentary Animal Reserve, museums, and the library program.

Girls Enabled is an innovative program designed for girls in the fourth grade and older that was launched at the Child Enrichment Center of Lorain in fall 2010. Driven by the girls’ interests in potential careers, the group is connected and exposed to strong, successful, college-educated women who are entrepreneurs and leaders in the community. Supported by grant dollars, the Girls Enabled participants have blossomed through activities which have included a tour of Oberlin College and speaking with professors and students, attending a cooking session at Cuyahoga Community College, and learning basic etiquette lessons such as the importance of eye contact, how to make a proper introduction and table manners which they put to good use during an excursion to the Cheesecake Factory.";"http://www.myneighborhoodalliance.org/child/child-care-locations/lorain";"https://www.facebook.com/MyAllianceNEO";;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://www.myneighborhoodalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/NALogoColor_Small2.png";"http://www.myneighborhoodalliance.org/wp-content/gallery/summer-enrichment-camp-2014/img_3210.jpg";"http://www.myneighborhoodalliance.org/wp-content/gallery/champions-for-charity-golf-tournament-2014/first-federal-of-lakewood.jpg";"http://www.myneighborhoodalliance.org/wp-content/gallery/home-run-for-the-homeless-2014/dsc_4349.jpg";"http://www.myneighborhoodalliance.org/wp-content/gallery/heroes-recognition-event/dsc_4149.jpg";;

Children acquire new knowledge through dramatic play, music and movement, science, literature, Bible teaching, language skills, creative arts, and activities that develop gross and fine motor skills.

Children begin to develop a positive self-concept, a sense of independence, and attain the ability to express, understand, and control their feelings.  They learn to positively interact with others, learning feeling of empathy and mutual respect among children and adults.

 To achieve these goals, our program is structured to offer children the opportunity to work independently and to participate in constructive group activities.

On the basis of her scientific observations of behavior of young children, she found that children learn best in a homelike setting filled with developmentally appropriate materials that support each child's unique growth and learning abilities.

Key facts that differentiate the Montessori from the conventional approach are: focus on ""total development"" of child, the environment, appropriate materials, and the prepared teacher.

The Montessori environment cultivates children's natural desire to learn at their own pace without interruption or coercion. The children learn new skills through a free choice of hands-on activities, with guidance from a prepared teacher who observes, counsels, and demonstrates appropriate activities to individuals or small groups. Montessori materials are age-appropriate, concrete, self teaching, and open-ended; they reflect reality and require active participation.

The result is a child with a well-rounded personality, positive self-image, improved physical coordination, better self-care, and an accurate perception of the world.

Children are creative and receptive, our program strives to nurture and encourage these qualities in our students. 

Through the experiences your child encounters your child will become more aware of the world around them and stir up curiosity so they will become eager to learn.  During the early years of your child’s life there is rapid growth taking place and important habits and attitudes are being formed.  These concepts attitudes and habits will affect your child’s personality and his/her potential to cope successfully in any environment. 

The goal of First Class Christian Child Care and Preschool is to provide an atmosphere that encourages your child’s intellectual, spiritual, emotional, social and physical growth and development as a whole.  We want these first experiences with others to be successful beginnings to the many years of formal education ahead.  Through the programs at our center your child will develop self-discipline, cooperative work and play, creative self-expression, group communication, development of coordination and muscle control, as well as many other social and physical growths.

Our curriculum includes sharing and conversation time, reading books, singing songs, finger-plays, creative art activities, crafts, and games.  Children have the opportunity to learn concepts like; shapes, colors, numbers and letters, and the celebration of birthdays and holidays. Our center is designed to reflect knowledge of child growth and development, offering learning opportunities that are age appropriate and individual appropriate.  Children will then naturally move to their next level of development.  

Communication with your child’s next teacher will assist our planning to prepare your child to succeed to the next level or school grade.  Our teaching methods and materials encourage independence, discovery and experimentation.  Materials are easily accessible to all students.  Materials are carefully chosen to serve as learning tools for younger children.  Our programs are stimulus-rich environments with a wide variety of learning materials.

Ganon Gil has a comprehensive and developmental program designed to help children reach their full potential socially and emotionally and provides them with the educational components necessary for future school success.

Ganon Gil is more then just a preschool, it is a family. Each staff member takes the time to not only get to know the children they teach but also the student's parents and siblings. The bonds that are created in the classroom, the hallways and the social functions at Ganon Gil allow the families to all feel connected and give the sense of a community of Jewish tradition.

Building strong minds and a sense of self is a goal of our teachers here at Ganon Gil. We offer a wide range of activities both in and out of the classroom to help our kids learn to be independent thinkers. By offering a variety of special enrichment programs and extended day activities we are not only able to meet the differing schedules of our families, but provide them with a way to add extra curricular activities without adding extra time in the car.

Ganon Gil's mission is to provide children with love and a caring atmosphere so that they can learn the social, emotional, physical and cognitive skills that they will need now and in the future.

Come and see why Ganon Gil Preschool is one of Cleveland's most innovative Jewish preschools and the place ""Where love and caring are the building blocks of the future.""

Voted in the top 3 best Jewish Preschools in Cleveland by The Source Magazine

Ganon Gil preschool is housed in the beautiful Temple, Beachwood. Rabbis Richard A. Block, Rosette Barron Haim , Roger C. Klein and Stacy Schlein, and Cantor Kathryn Wolfe Sebo participate in programming, along with The Temple's outstanding Judaic education team.

The students have access to The Temple's state-of-the-art library and resource center, the sanctuary, and a brand new playground. The Temple's renowned Museum of Religious Art and the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage, adjacent to The Temple, will also be available to the students and their families as unique educational resources.

It is important to realize that we are creating an environment which provides learning situations for children.

We firmly believe that young children learn best by ""doing"". Children are given a creative set of materials and are encouraged to master skills with a minimum amount of Care Giver involvement.

Child care works best when there is a combination of structure and freedom, so our Care Givers maintain a balance of child-directed and adult-supported activities. Therefore, toys, games and lessons are planned for specific purposes and all are designed to inspire interest and excitement.

Our program supports and encourages each child's individual development; socially, emotionally, cognitively and physically. No child is forced to do something he or she is not developmentally ready to do.";"http://www.growingyearsnursery.com/";;;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.growingyearsnursery.com/templates/Weekend/img/company_name.gif";"http://www.growingyearsnursery.com/mediac/400_0/media/6a8aa0efd1a1e22cffff9723ffffe41e.JPG";"http://www.growingyearsnursery.com/mediac/400_0/media/DIR_4101/6a8aa0efd1a1e22cffff9b18ffffe41e.JPG";"http://www.growingyearsnursery.com/mediac/400_0/media/61821faed1a1e04bffff9c38ffffe41e.jpg";"http://www.growingyearsnursery.com/mediac/400_0/media/6a8aa0efd1a1e22cffff9722ffffe41e.JPG";;

At Kids Encounter Preschool and Daycare, we know children learn best by investigating, exploring and playing not by being crammed up in a small room all day. That’s why our center has one of the largest amounts of space dedicated to providing all the room your little one needs,  including a full size gymnasium.

Being a non-profit preschool and daycare our bottom line is not financial. Our bottom line is providing incredible child care and preschool at an affordable price.

Feel free to schedule an appointment to see our safe, secure, well maintained center or just drop by for a visit anytime. You will like what you see and if we have space available, you can enroll your child on the spot.

Resnik, the American engineer and NASA astronaut who was born in Akron, OH in 1949 and died in 1986, when the Challenger space shuttle was destroyed during its launch. She was the second female American astronaut in space.  The original school building was known as the Fairlawn School, named for the village of Fairlawn, and was constructed in 1929. It was part of Portage Township until it was annexed by the city of Akron in 1931, when the city extended its western boundary. Fairlawn can trace its ""school"" to the 1820s. The 1929 building contains, in its cornerstone, the names of the children and teachers of the school and a history of Portage Township.

Children may attend any combination of days and hours per week that are available.  Each child must attend school a minimum of 2, three hour sessions per week.  Half day sessions are from 8:30-11:30am and 1:00-4:00pm.  The full day session is from 8:30am-4:00pm.  Extended hours are available to accommodate parent's schedules, from as early as 7:00am or as late as 5:30pm, Monday-Friday. 

Our school follows the Ohio Academic Content Standards for Preschool.  These set guidelines list what materials and subject matters must be covered during the preschool year.  This material is used as a learning step, and the Kindergarten teacher will take this preschool knowledge and build from it.

We are also a one star rated Step Up To Quality program. Step Up To Quality is Ohio's voluntary quality rating system for child care programs recognizing early care and education programs that exceed quality for Ohio's children.

We have two classrooms that separate the 3-4 year old from the 4-5 year old preschoolers.  This allows you to send your child multiple years if you chose, without them repeating the same program.


For families that need tuition assistance, we work with the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services.

Finally, we care about your child and are always willing to communicate.  Parents receive frequent updates on class activities, and all of our teachers are available for conferences or phone calls before and after school.

This ensures that your child is being offered nutritionally balanced meals each and every day. Our breakfast and snack contains at least two of the 4 major food groups. Our lunches our catered in and contain all four major food groups. We serve milk with breakfast and lunch, daily. We serve our children portions that are guided by the U.S.D.A. Standards. We keep our sweets to a minimum. You are welcome to bring in a treat for your child’s birthday to share with the class. We pride ourselves on our staff guiding our children through their daily activities using developmentally appropriate practices. We match each child’s goals with their individual developmental level in each and every area of learning. We encourage our children to explore many avenues of creativity. Painting alone offers so many creative choices. Here are a few examples. Painting with…marbles, fruit, fingers, feet, water and sponges are just a few of the many sensory materials that we offer for our children to create their masterpieces. We also incorporate many unconventional art materials. While out on our nature walks, we gather all sorts of materials for our art projects. They include, but are not limited to, nuts, berries, twigs and seeds. Children enjoy creating nature collages. Our children’s art projects are their own, not the teachers. So, when their turtle has three eyes and eight feet, you will know this is straight from their imagination! We offer many opportunities throughout the day for our children to enjoy and learn through literature. Each of our classrooms have a book nook for our children to “chill out” and relax with a book. We also offer literacy teaching through word recognition by having your child’s name on their lunch table and cubicle as well as items labeled throughout the classroom, using Spanish as well as English. We do encourage our school-agers to work on their homework with the assistance of the teacher, when needed. This teaches them time management as well as freeing up some time to enjoy their evening at home with mom and dad.";"http://www.lakewoodcommunitycare.com/contact-us/";;"6:30 AM – 6:00 PM";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.lakewoodcommunitycare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Boy-With-Blocks2-300x200.jpg";"http://www.lakewoodcommunitycare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/slide0131.jpg";"http://www.lakewoodcommunitycare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/slide0231.jpg";"http://www.lakewoodcommunitycare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/slide0331.jpg";;

We absolutely love working with children and it is our priority to create a safe, comfortable, and exciting environment that will assist all children in reaching their full potential through making friends, sharing, taking turns, playing, and exploring their world.  Lewis Center Preschool is a place where children are encouraged to develop their own unique, individual potentials and talents.  We provide a healthy, loving, child-centered environment to aid young children in all areas of development:  social-emotional, cognitive, and physical.  It is our goal to help young children develop a feeling of self-confidence so that they can have the freedom to be curious and creative. 

It is our belief that the best assurance for the success of each child’s learning experience is through a close relationship between our teachers and our families.  Parents are their child’s first and most important teachers and by working together we can help each child build a solid foundation of skills for future success in life.  This partnership is designed to help parents have the opportunity to participate as classroom volunteers, attend family activities throughout the year and support the preschool in a variety of ways. We offer conferences in the fall and in the spring.  Special conferences can be arranged whenever they are needed.  Our staff is always willing to assist in any way possible.

Lewis Center Preschool has a professional staff of knowledgeable teachers experienced in the field of Early Childhood Education.  They plan a stimulating, creative program aligned to the state content standards.  They continue their professional development by participating in staff meetings, in-service training, workshops, and conferences.  All staff has the required background checks as required by licensing regulations.  Our teachers have been trained in:  CPR, Communicable Diseases, First Aid, and Child Abuse and renew as required. 

Once again, thank you for taking the time to tour our preschool and we hope that you have enjoyed spending some time with us!  Please feel free to call the preschool office at 740-548-1934 if you think of any questions that you may have thought of since your tour.

YMCA programs and services have grown and adapted to the changing needs of families. Today, more and more parents are looking for quality, yet affordable childcare they can depend on. Whether your child is attending our infant/toddler program, preschool or our school age child care program, our goal is to provide a safe, fun environment. Like all Y programs, childcare is open to all.

With so many demands on today’s families, parents need all the support they can get. That’s why child care at the Y is about more than looking after kids. It’s about nurturing their development by providing a safe place for them to learn the foundational skills of Early Childhood Education, develop healthy, trusting relationships, and build self-reliance through the Y values. We believe the values and skills learned early on are vital building blocks for quality of life. The Preschool program is focused from the very beginning on Kindergarten readiness. We begin our Early Preschool program with our 2 ½ year olds. Our year-round curriculum includes thematic units that move the children through a progression of learning that can be adapted to meet the individual needs of the children at each level. Our facility allows us to provide the children breakfast, a full hot lunch and an afternoon snack as well as weekly swimming lessons and weekly gymnastics classes. We strive to educate the parent about the importance of their role in their child’s education from the very beginning. We keep parents informed through newsletters, scheduled and impromptu conferences, formal assessments and an open door policy that allows parents full view of what their child is involved in daily. We also encourage the parents to participate in family events throughout the year and to utilize our facility. A strong family relationship is vital to the ongoing education of our children, and we know that strong kids and strong families build strong communities.

We emphasize the four core values: caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility. We teach this to the children through day to day experiences, activities, and lessons. We give the children the opportunity to use verbal communication to solve problems. Our staff serves as positive role models and provides care that is supportive, nurturing, warm and responsive to each child's needs.  Our open door policy allows parents the freedom of knowing what their children are doing at all times during the day.

Our center is open Monday – Friday from 6:00 AM – 6:00 PM. We are a small center compared to others in the Medina area so we are able to offer a family focused style. Throughout the day the children are given opportunities where they can spend time with additional age groups/siblings and get to know one another. This creates a bond that will follow these children through their early school years.
The owners Renee Miller and Elizabeth Kelkenberg have known each other for over 20 years. Renee has been providing care for children in the area for over 30 years one of them being Elizabeth when she was young. In 2009 Renee and Elizabeth founded Litchfield Preschool and Child Care Center. Staff turnover is very small so you will see the same faces day to day as many of the employees have been here from the start.
Preschool tuition includes our enrichment classes. We offer a weekly Kindermusik program where children discover the basics of music, art, movement and language through a variety of activities and instruments. The children participate in a weekly Yoga class where they discover and strengthen their growing bodies and enhance body awareness.
Parent Participation is a key to the cognitive, physical and social development of your child. Parents are welcome to participate in any of our center activities. We believe with Parent Participation it is another positive way of keeping the lines of communication between staff at the center and the parents. Throughout the year we host numerous events and parties that bring families back to the center after hours to mingle and get to know one another.

Our devoted professional staff believes play is the key for learning in the early years. Play is one of the most dynamic childhood learning methods. Play is a voluntary activity which permits freedom of action, diversion from routines and an imaginary world to master on their own.

 Little Learners Child Development Center believes that social growth and establishment of high self esteem are also essential. We believe that every child can reach their full potential at their own individual pace, in a developmentally age appropriate program. The teachers encourage the children to actively involve themselves in every learning experience, utilizing both individual and cooperative play situations to increase sensory exploration of materials and activities. We feel that young children function best in a consistent program with small group sizes and a familiar caregiver.

Warm, positive relationships with adults help children develop a sense of trust and feelings of worth. Because a child's experience at Little Learners is a supplement to their home experience, we feel very strongly that staff and families should work together in order to provide for optimal development of the children. Most of all we strive to create the loving and caring atmosphere of home.";"http://www.littlelearnersltd.com/";;"Monday -Friday. 5:30am-7:30pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.littlelearnersltd.com/images/banner.jpg?nxg_versionuid=published";"http://littlelearnerschilddevelo.liveonatt.com/images/FFA_023L.jpg";"http://littlelearnerschilddevelo.liveonatt.com/images/100_1172.JPG";"http://littlelearnerschilddevelo.liveonatt.com/images/100_1041.JPG";"http://littlelearnerschilddevelo.liveonatt.com/images/100_1043.JPG";;

Little Learners' goal is for every child enrolled to have the opportunity to grow and learn through structured academics, creative play, arts and crafts, and social and physical opportunities. It is important that the child feels confident and happy. A sense of accomplishment will be developed by praising the child's efforts and hard work.

Loving. Laughing."" We believe it takes all three of these environmental components to foster a healthy, happy child. Educational excellence in an impersonal, institutionalized setting is a failure. Highly qualified teachers who aren't warm and affectionate is a failure. Acclaimed curriculum that doesn't provide opportunities for fun and play is a failure.  We combine educational excellence with a warm, loving approach to care and add a healthy dose of fun and play every day. Our approaches are forward-thinking, original, exclusive, and proven.

Little Leprechaun Academy is located in Mason, Ohio.  We are not a franchise.  We are privately owned and operated and dedicated to providing innovative, quality care and early education to the children we serve.  

Little Leprechaun Academy is open earlier and stays open later than any nearby competitors.  We also offer breakfast, a morning snack, lunch, an afternoon snack and even dinner if your child is scheduled during the times they are served.  All meals are prepared by our very own executive chef, who also provides take-home-meals for parents.";"http://www.littleleprechaun.com/";"https://www.facebook.com/LittleLeprechaunAcademy/info?tab=page_info";"Monday:       6:00am to 7:30pm

Along with these helpful services we are a part of the Children and Adults Care Food Program (CACFP) which helps children get either free or reduced meals. We provide all nutritious breakfasts, lunches and snacks. A menu is provided upon request.

Our curriculum is based on the Montessori Method which means more learning by ""free activity"" play by using colored blocks, wooden sticks, songs, instruments, dancing etc. while still maintaining a structured and prepared environment. This allows children to have independence and enhance their natural psychological development. Some worksheets are incorporated for children who are getting ready to enter Kindergarten. These worksheets help children foster the ability to write and recognize their names, recognize letters, colors, shapes, etc. Each class including toddlers have a daily schedule they follow to keep children in the routine of things. This keeps structure in their daily lives as they also learn to socialize with other children.";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Little-Scholars-Learning-Center/291635097551428?sk=info&tab=page_info";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Little-Scholars-Learning-Center/291635097551428?sk=info&tab=page_info";"Mon - Fri:

It’s natural. After all, the next best thing to a parent is family. It’s Grandma, Sister, Aunt, or Cousin. When family isn’t available, a child care center can often feel like settling for your third or fourth option.

What if your child care center could feel like family? Well, it can.

Programs, policies, facilities, and funding are important, but they don’t ease the guilt or bring you peace of mind. You need a better option – something more than daycare. You need Child Care That Feels Like Family.

Look, you have to work and you have to have child care. That’s OK. You’re not a bad parent. And you’re not alone. We understand and we’re here to help. Let us be your support, your partners, your team. We can do this together.";"http://www.littlevillagekids.com/contact-us/";"https://www.facebook.com/childcarefairfield";"Mon - Fri:

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

Head Start is a federally funded preschool specifically for low income children ages 3 to 5. 

Head Start is a national program that promotes school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. 

Head Start programs are operated by local organizations, usually nonprofits, but not always. Children who attend Head Start participate in a variety of educational activities. They also receive free medical and dental care, enjoy healthy meals and snacks, and play outdoors and indoors in a safe setting. Head Start centers are required to meet all State and local licensing regulations. 

Head Start provides children with activities that help them grow mentally, socially, emotionally and physically while assisting them with school readiness. 

The majority of the children served in Head Start are low income, below 130% of the national poverty guidelines. About ten percent of the children served may be above income and are selected based on need. 

Kno Ho Co Ashland CAC currently operates half day Head Start programs at all 5 locations. Children attend for 3.5 hours per day, for 128 days during a school year. Classes typically begin in September and last until mid-May. Classes are held Monday through Thursday with Fridays available to staff for training. 

Head Start teachers must have a degree in Early Childhood Education or a related field. Many of the teachers hold State of Ohio Teaching licenses. Assistant teachers must have a minimum of a CDA certificate, but many have taken college level classes in Early Childhood Education.

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

We have served children ages 18 months to pre-Kindergarten from the community for more than 25 years!

A year-round curriculum with learning centers and motivational activities that build important foundations for future reading and other academic skills are provided.

Weekly themes are used to coordinate a well-balanced curriculum which fosters curiosity and creativity in your developing child.

The Center is licensed by the State of Ohio, Department of Jobs & Family Services.  Olentangy Church Child Care is a small, family oriented center with a license capacity of 35 children.

A STEP UP TO QUALITY center - Ohio's voluntary rating system for programs that exceed quality benchmarks of Ohio licensing standards.  Benchmarks are ratio, group size, staff education and qualifications, specialized training, administrative practices and early learning.

Through the Olentangy Church, we offer a 20% reduced tuition for those who meet the income standard of the Ohio Child and Adult Care Food Program.

We have outdoors: a very large playground where the children can run and ride their bikes;  a grassy area for playing ball and swimming in the summer and; a climbing area with a large covered sand box that leads to many fun adventures.

Field trips are a highlight for us, and if we can't get out we invite special visitors in.  Favorite trips are to the zoo and the pumpkin farm where the adults can outnumber the kids!  Monthly we visit the nursing home next door to us to share our songs, programs, and annually have our July 4th bike parade there. Our families which include many of the children's grandparents love to attend our programs at Christmas and Graduation.

    where children learn through THEIR learning style (hands on, visual, auditory, through movement, etc.)
Not all babies start babbling words and sounds at the same time or learn to crawl at the exact same age.  Children grow and develop at their own, individual pace.  This continues throughout childhood and is respected at Parma Preschool.
When some children start preschool they know the whole alphabet and can write their name.  Others cannot even hold a pencil.  Why then, would we assume that all children need to be taught the letter A at the same point in the school year?
We don't teach like that.
Preschool is much more than ABCs and 123s... it's learning to get along with peers, share, be kind and repectful to others.  It is learning to be healthy and active.  It is learning how to problem solve, negotiate, figure things out and make choices; not just being told what to do, how to do it and when!  
We follow the children's lead, meet them where they are at and help them reach the next level in their development.

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

In addition, we seek to lay a Godly spiritual foundation for each child, on which they can build upon the rest of their lives.

The Christian faith and Bible teachings are a very important part of the daily curriculum at Richwood Christian Preschool. We believe this is a great complement to the academic and social preparation the children receive. Our focus is on helping children develop the skills they’ll need to be fully prepared for their kindergarten year in school. This includes time spent on not only academic skills but also those important social skills such as learning how to get along with others and being part of a group. In addition, activities which help to improve fine and gross motor skills are a part of the child’s day.

The Robin Rogers Day Service is a state licensed day care program, whose mission is to serve children with developmental delays and disabilities. Our program has existed for over thirty years, with a rich and successful history of serving children with disabilities. Our staff boasts an average of a dozen years of experience each. They receive annual training in CPR and First Aid, Communicable Disease, and Child Abuse and Neglect, as well as regular training on medical issues, behavior modification techniques, and a wide variety of other areas imperative to teaching young children. We contract for services through both the Allen County Department of Job & Family Services and the Allen County Childrens Services Board. In addition to serving children with special needs, we also serve siblings of children with developmental disabilities who are already enrolled. We recognize that developmental disabilities affect the entire family and child care is often necessary for the entire sibling group. In addition to siblings, we also accept a small percentage of children who are “typically developed.” Extensive research has shown that integrated classrooms are beneficial for everyone, including our society as a whole.";"http://www.arcallencounty.org/day.htm";;"Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.";;"http://www.arcallencounty.org/Applications/Day%20Services/Day_Service_Application.pdf";"http://www.arcallencounty.org/Applications/Day%20Services/Parent_Handbook.pdf";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.arcallencounty.org/Images/class1.jpg";"http://www.arcallencounty.org/Images/class2.jpg";"http://www.arcallencounty.org/Images/girls_dancing.jpg";"http://www.arcallencounty.org/Images/kids3.jpg";;

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

MYCAP is Helping People, Changing Lives.";"http://www.my-cap.org/locations";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/MYCAP-Mahoning-Youngstown-Community-Action-Partnership/253808185491";;"http://www.my-cap.org/about/employment";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.my-cap.org/wp-content/themes/mycap/images/mycaplogo.png";;;;;;

It is our big interest to find out what each child needs individually, as every child is a different world.  We always start the school year with assessments and observations on their behavior and learning styles.  All this together offers the opportunity to our teachers to know each student and is able to have a meaningful parent-teacher conference in October-November.

At that time every parent has the opportunity to set goals for their child, what they wish to see happen with their child""s education, behavior challenges, or anything that may require special attention.  Children will also have the following screenings at the beginning of every school year: Vision, Hearing, Height and Weight and Dental.  If after the screenings there is a need for a follow up; parents get informed as to what steps to take after the results.

Since 2010 Romake has been working closer with the school districts in these matters when additional screenings to evaluate a child before entering Kindergarten are necessary.  We also create a relationship with teachers to let us know the needs of our school age child.  This way we are able to assist them after school, along with their daily homework.

We offer free transportation for our school agers attending Rosehill, Herbert Mills, Old Orchard,Tussing Elementary, and Hannah Ashton Middle School.  Any other school outside our route will have an additional fee for transportation.

Our goal is to assist our parents with their children with their care and education.  We partner with our parents to prepare every child for a successful future!

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

Some of the goals of our Preschool are to teach children respect for others, to nuture the love of Jesus, to master social skills, and generally to prepare preschoolers for kindergarten.  Kindergarten readiness is evaluated at the end of the school year, according to these sample categories: recognition of shapes, numbers, colors and sizes; physical coordination; pre-writing skills; listening skills; math skills; language and pre-reading skills; awareness of his/her surroundings; emotional readiness; and social skills.

Curriculum in the Preschool is what happens throughout the day that contributes to the social, emotional, physical, cognitive, and spiritual growth and development of the young child.  It includes Bible stories and worship, music, art, health, language, social studies, mental and emotional health, science, math, and physical development activities.  These subjects are not taught separately, but rather are integrated into the happenings of the entire day, carefully orchestrated and woven together by the teacher as facilitator.  Our approach to learning is sometimes called the whole approach to learning.

Faith development is the core of the curriculum in a Lutheran preschool.  All activities add to the spiritual life of young children.  Faith development is more than having an isolated ""Jesus time"" in the daily schedule.  Integrated in the curriculum are experiences that help a child understand God's love for all people.";"http://stjohnsgeneva.org/preschool.php";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Johns-Lutheran-Church-Lcms/116873814997306";"Mon - Fri:

To earn NAEYC Accreditation, St. Stephen’s Christ Child-Child Care Center went through an extensive self-study process; measuring the program and its services against the ten new NAEYC early childhood standards and more than 400 related accreditation criteria. NAEYC accreditation has become a widely recognized mark of high quality early childhood education.

St. Stephen’s Christ Child-Child Care Center’s NAEYC accreditation is a sign that they are a leader in a national effort to invest in high quality early childhood education, and provide critical elements needed to give their children a better start.

Organized in 1991, St. Stephen’s Christ Child Center provides quality care for children of parents who are working, receiving job training, or attending an educational program. It is our goal to provide programming in the areas of: physical & motor development, social & emotional development, language development, cognitive development and general approaches toward learning. In an atmosphere of acceptance and affirmation, we work to maximize each child’s natural ability to feel competent and confident, with a positive self-esteem and to be successful in future educational experiences.

Tuition is assessed on a sliding fee scale. 90% of our families qualify for State subsidized funds through Block Grants and TANF dollars.

In 1917 it was decided to build a school, now known as the Boulevard School. This building was completed the same year. From the beginning, the Sisters of St. Joseph, CSJ, staffed the parish school and formed an important part of the parish’s educational life. The new school was completed in the 1950’s, with over 1,000 students and continues to serve the present diverse population of 370 students.

In the 1960’s the construction of Interstate 90 cut through the west side community and divided the neighborhood. Many families left the area and relocated in the suburbs. This loss of parishioners coupled with court ordered busing proved very challenging for the neighborhood and school.";"http://www.stignatiusofantioch-school.org/";;;;"http://www.stignatiusofantioch-school.org/registration.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://www.stignatiusofantioch-school.org/images/header0.gif";"http://www.stignatiusofantioch-school.org/images/church.gif";;;;;

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

MYCAP is Helping People, Changing Lives.";"http://www.my-cap.org/locations";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/MYCAP-Mahoning-Youngstown-Community-Action-Partnership/253808185491";;"http://www.my-cap.org/about/employment";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.my-cap.org/wp-content/themes/mycap/images/mycaplogo.png";;;;;;

We are an outreach ministry of the United Methodist Church in Stow. This program provides care, nurturing, and education to children in Stow and the surrounding communities. Children's Place strives to serve families in the spirit expressed in the church statement: ""BIG ENOUGH TO SERVE, SMALL ENOUGH TO CARE.""

Children's Place is open from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. year round. We serve children from 18 months old through the fourth grade of elementary school. Children are transported to our program by the Stow Munroe Falls school bus system from Echo Hills and Holy Family. Special needs children are transported from Indian Trail.

We take the security of our students seriously. The classroom doors are locked during class-time, and we have installed a new keypad system on the entry doors to help ensure the safety of everyone.

Our student teacher ratio is kept low to help give each child the quality care they deserve. The toddler room (18 months through two and one half years) has a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 6. Our three year old preschool class has a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 10. Our four year old preschool class has a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 12. Our school age program has a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 15.

Our fees are competitive with other area day care centers. Because we are an outreach ministry of our church, we also accept children subsidized by Summit County and by Portage County. A sliding fee scale is available for families who qualify.";"http://www.stowumc.org/?q=childrensplace";;"7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;;;;;;

The combination of approaches helps develop the child's perceptual, scientific, mathematical, and language skills. All classes incorporate social experiences with literature, science, music, and dramatic play.

Licensing--The Village Preschool is licensed by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The license is renewed annually by the agency following two comprehensive site inspections, including classroom observation.

Parent Involvement--The Village Preschool offers a variety of ways for parents to be involved in the classrooms and school. Teachers often ask for assistance with special events including field trips and special holiday celebrations. The Parents Association organizes several events throughout the year and needs chairs and workers for each of those activities.

The curriculum consists of a mixture of child-directed and teachers-directed activities in a relaxed classroom with hands-on concrete learning experiences.

Trinity Lutheran Preschool is a member of the educational system of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, which supports the largest protestant network of Christian schools and colleges in the nation. The Preschool staff includes a certified Administrator/Teacher. We are licensed by the State of Ohio and meet all State standards and requirements.

The Preschool offers classes for 4 and 5 year olds in the morning and afternoon on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Classes for 3 year olds are offered on Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 9:00 a.m.";"http://www.trinitylutheranchurch-elmore.com/Preschool.html";;;;"http://trinitylutheranchurch-elmore.com/newsletters/Preschool.pdf";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.trinitylutheranchurch-elmore.com/images/trinitybanner3.jpg";"http://www.trinitylutheranchurch-elmore.com/images/TLPS.jpg";;;;;

Our number one goal is to prepare children for kindergarten. Our curriculum takes into account the importance of social skills and group-work while focusing on the necessary educational skills. 
Head Start is available in either one of our centers or in your own home.

The Head Start Home Base option focuses on parents as educators and includes regular home visits by an assigned home visitor who works with families and supports parents in meeting the needs of their young children. Home Base is available anywhere in Washington or Morgan Counties. Our centers offer 3-½ hour classes four days a week and provide transportation where available, breakfast or lunch and a snack. Both of our options provide services for children with disabilities, family nights, parent groups and more.

Head Start teachers are constantly receiving the most current training in childhood education and development. We also work closely with the local school systems on many issues and have an on-going evaluation process that allows the teachers and parents to monitor the child's progress.

Program goals are set for improving the school readiness of children that align with the requirements and expectations of the schools. School readiness goals are the expectations that children's evolvement of language and literacy, cognition and general knowledge, approaches towards learning, physical well-being and motor development, and social and emotional development will improve children's' readiness for kindergarten.";"http://www.wmcap.org/headstart.html";;;"http://www.wmcap.org/employment.html";"http://www.wmcap.org/app_headstart.pdf";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.wmcap.org/_gfxredesign/topbar_left.gif";"http://www.wmcap.org/gfx-photos/service_headstart.jpg";;;;;

Fay DeHaven. Mrs Dehaven operated the Center at 2081 Willowgrove in the present home of Mrs. Mary Kingdom, who was part of our staff for over 17 years. The Center was known back then as WeeFolks. WeeHaven moved to the present address in 1959.

Mrs. Sarah Benson worked as a Program Director for Mrs. DeHaven in Head Start. She and her husband, Robert bought the Center in 1969 and moved into the second floor, where they lived with their two boys, Eric and Tony, until the Center expanded into the area in 1984.

Mrs. DeHaven had dreams of what she wanted WeeHaven to be. Many of her ideas have been realized over the years. including 3 expansions. A small expansion in 1971 and the multi-purpose room in 1977. Today what you see at WeeHaven is a result of the 27 years of the Labor of Love and dedication to children by the Benson’s and Mrs. DeHaven.

In January of 1996, WeeHaven was purchased by Sue and Greg Engler. At the time of the sale, Sue and Greg were parents of two children who had attended WeeHaven for 5 years. It was their objective to Keep the WeeHaven tradition going by continuing to provide a Center with a warm, loving, family atmosphere, where children can learn. Sue is a nurse by education and is now the director of the Center.

As we enjoy another year at WeeHaven we thank God for all the children, parents and staff who are here now, as well as the thousands who have passed through our doors over the past 57 years.";"http://weehaven.com/";;"6:30 am to 5:45 pm";;;;"n";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"http://weehavenblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cropped-large-shorter.jpg";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10850220_803901676335352_8296387929310200298_n.jpg?oh=61ed34cd8812cac0703a24933f8a8f93&oe=5543D37F";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10850220_803900896335430_3161987911520191242_n.jpg?oh=c03364ae517a0ac9db7f089b3062b466&oe=5533B2EA";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10848027_803893906336129_1281271677062982505_n.jpg?oh=9a8d9d4b25f4816671a4258ee0f3a573&oe=5532CE8F&__gda__=1430644329_25ad5b8f7ec842956e85161d0ca2988b";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1601211_795921347133385_4912081059056612206_n.jpg?oh=64175a4a55d8689860294245f07ee0bd&oe=54F9673F&__gda__=1429450984_c069be421be42b49d5fd989bc8320760";;

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

(We have a sister center next door that takes children 6 weeks - Kindergarten.) Our friendly and caring staff provides transportation, snacks, and a developmentally- appropriate environment for school age children. Our clean, stimulating facility includes a homework room (with help from our teachers if needed), a large playing area with plenty of available toys/activities, a quiet reading room with couches and many books, arts and crafts supplies, and so much more! Both group and individual games are frequently played to help foster cooperation, teamwork, and character building skills. We have degreed staff with extensive early childhood experience who are fully trained in CPR, First Aid, Prevention of Child Abuse, and Communicable Diseases. We also have an action-packed summer camp that includes daily field trips to local parks, movies, the City Pool, bowling, and other fun locations!

In this loving, caring environment children experience hands-on activities which help to develop and enhance their creativity. They are challenged to seek and explore answers through natural curiosity and self expression. We believe it is important to give the children entrusted in our care the precious gift of love and the knowledge of being loved. It is our intent to provide individual attention through low child/teacher ratios. These low ratios allow children to develop at their own pace, aiding them as they develop a sense of value, self respect, and independence.  Special aspects of our program include: a weekly chapel program with the pastor, participation in the federal food program, field trips and special events to enhance our weekly educational themes. We operate weekly, Monday through Friday, during the hours of 6:30 a.m. through 6:00 p.m. Our fully trained staff provide a variety of experiences based on their own educations and backgrounds and meet all standards set forth by the State of Ohio licensing laws.";"http://www.churchofthecrossum.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16:world-of-love-daycare&catid=7:childrens-ministries&Itemid=38";"https://www.facebook.com/churchofthecrossum";"Mon - Fri:

The objective to provide activities and programs which promote family life in southwest Ohio, has met, and at time exceeded the original objectives of the founders of the Countryside YMCA. Through a variety of programs that extend beyond the ""traditional"" the Countryside YMCA in Lebanon, Ohio has become one of the world's largest and most progressive YMCA programs.";"http://www.countrysideymca.org/child-care-centers/locations/";"https://www.facebook.com/countrysideymca?ref=search&sid=1280836280.970277671..1";"6:30am-6pm";"http://www.countrysideymca.org/about-us/employment-opportunities.html";;"http://www.countrysideymca.org/pdfs/childcare/Clinton%20Massie%20Handbook.pdf";"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://www.countrysideymca.org/_t/img/orange/logo.png";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/532925_10152857190230522_3126245771037607033_n.jpg?oh=c4d476702954ff19e247cdbbd646af85&oe=550E2AA1&__gda__=1426593279_1ccfc056062263d538c9cbcdbd4e200a";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/1509830_10152887544265522_2967035827901516546_n.jpg?oh=b9f026334ce98f413a8e56faa03bd4f5&oe=5538F04B&__gda__=1430547783_35ead6212a70406f8e8c09d677cb6619";"https://scontent-b-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1441573_10152959561110522_2967510081019814346_n.jpg?oh=09bc25d57bde6dc51ddcd9d58678332b&oe=55016088";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/1016426_10152857188135522_7282952582433890769_n.jpg?oh=a542c518cfa8bff4a47ef76865f8a8b6&oe=54FEB9F4&__gda__=1430421240_0f1037b77d25efbf83915b28151ef302";;

Our approach to Early Childhood Education is that the teachers builds upon, not directs or controls, the thoughts and actions of the children. Child-initiated activities foster independence at a time when it is important for pre-schoolers to begin to develop self-reliance. We resist the increasing pressure to teach young children facts and figures before they are ready and to focus instead on nurturing their special skills and abilities. Children actively playing are busy learning about the world in ways children learn best by exploring and working with people, materials and ideas. Children are much more likely to learn when they become intensely involved in projects of their own design. Our teacher’s role is to ensure that the children choose and organize their own work by helping each child develop a plan, define a sequence of steps, and identify needed materials. Significant amount of time are spent in child/adult interaction. Talking together, sharing ideas and playing together are essential parts of our program
Ample space is important for active learning and the arrangement of our classrooms reflect the belief that children learn best in a stimulating, but ordered environment. The classroom is divided into well-defined work areas, and the materials in each area are organized to enable the children to express their own interest by choosing their own materials. Materials that can be used in a variety of ways encourage children to solve problems creatively. The teacher’s responsibility is to create and maintain a physical setting that provides a balanced environment in which children’s strengths and interest are valued. Our preschoolers are supported as they learn to communicate and get along with others.
Young Dimensions Childcare’s role is to expose children to learning, not impose learning on them. Children have a natural love for learning. We hope to cultivate this love learning and see it grow.";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Young-Dimensions-Childcare-Centers-Inc/172576302804057?sk=info&tab=page_info";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Young-Dimensions-Childcare-Centers-Inc/172576302804057?sk=info&tab=page_info";;;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/q84/p720x720/995630_831790073549340_4258534143081306508_n.jpg?oh=223b4b02643e71511023e02dc6eb117c&oe=55407122";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/154366_438841542844197_1085496279_n.jpg?oh=0aed1e5ae9b96877f3aac1b8f41d3aba&oe=5545C930&__gda__=1429143245_dd99b98aae5d6c2231cf411d02107bdb";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/301211_201267509934936_6428251_n.jpg?oh=b52c361044f410677c53c951c2b6b5f2&oe=55294FB6&__gda__=1428956671_3ffd3f9e81dd23f159ec582aa0ba4d3e";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/293961_201267083268312_215727_n.jpg?oh=06109bae1a370698c11cf0c03f5588a7&oe=553384D1&__gda__=1430316996_44001b28b047090fc1ce0519593584ac";;

826011;"EARTH CAMP";"14240 BAIRD RD";"OBERLIN";"OH";44074;"LORAIN";4409655551;"http://commongroundcenter.org/programs/pathfinders-youth-programs/earth-camp/earth-camp-faq/";;"Earth Camp is a special place. At the heart of our work is a striving to enhance young people’s sense of relationship with themselves, each other, and with the world. Our belief is that children who attend Earth Camp gain a stronger sense of the diversity of life and possess new tools to assist them in sustaining relationships with their peers, families, and the community-at-large through understanding diversity, peacemaking, human worth, dignity, and respect, and through their own role in the world.

We believe that children should have a safe and nourishing structured environment where they can grow in the company of their peers and under the guidance of positive role models. We seek to provide a space where children are free of bullying, all forms of violence, and negative influences. Rather, Earth Camp is a place where human dignity and respect are cherished, where children are affirmed and encouraged to grow into their full potential in body, mind, and spirit, and where children can be simply that, children. Rarely will one hear a staff person raising their voice to a child at Earth Camp. Positive reinforcements are utilized in behavioral management and we talk campers through behavioral issues, helping to understand the natural consequences of their actions rather than responding punitively. We devote energy towards fostering group cohesiveness, in recognition of the importance of community and believing that children succeed in a positive group setting. There are very few competitive elements at camp and we emphasize the ability of each child to succeed in her/his own way.

We are committed to being one of the most diverse youth programs in Lorain County. Earth Camp is a non-profit summer camp and all revenue generated goes towards operating expenses and providing more children with an Earth Camp experience. Approximately 75% of children attending camp are able to attend with financial assistance. It is Common Ground’s goal to provide a summer camp experience for children of ALL backgrounds and ALL walks of life.

Earth Camp has a strong environmental education component. We believe that by learning about our impact on the natural world, developing an appreciation of it and the interrelatedness of all beings, children will make more responsible decisions and live in the world more safely and gently. Our entire environmental education program is experiential, hands- on, and interactive, and intertwines components of other programs.

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

MYCAP is Helping People, Changing Lives.";"http://www.my-cap.org/locations";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/MYCAP-Mahoning-Youngstown-Community-Action-Partnership/253808185491";;"http://www.my-cap.org/about/employment";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.my-cap.org/wp-content/themes/mycap/images/mycaplogo.png";;;;;;

ASD develops dynamic programs using an experiential learning model and aligns its classes to state academic standards.           

           Since 1994, After School Discovery has nurtured children's interest in education and learning through fun, engaging programs. Students have experienced the magic of science while looking through microscopes, connected to learning through cooking, created modern dance choreography with professional dancers, and have been inspired by their success in learning. Over the years ASD has grown and has provided over 30,000 learning opportunities. 

          ASD collaborates with local school districts, organizations, and businesses in order to better carry out its mission. Research has shown that a child's success in school is influenced by parents, schools, and community members working together to support student achievement. ASD is an essential link in encouraging a strong support system for students through a community learning support team, volunteer programs and mentorship opportunities.";"http://www.afterschooldiscovery.com/#!donate/c1ghi";"https://www.facebook.com/AfterSchoolDiscovery";;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/d1b7b1_ffa3203a1f874835ac58b236b8ddeed4.jpg_srz_p_105_93_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10850060_517244301751578_406344499752416046_n.jpg?oh=f0855f090ca2cad3288ec4098ca76d9a&oe=553E365A";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10600380_516753081800700_3035806445860648258_n.jpg?oh=5e2408623bd75d9ebf20e6fcf9eb6383&oe=5534552C";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10635754_504068956402446_2829878771788246686_n.jpg?oh=4d84bc000451da3256ed9efe81dd7efe&oe=55353AF7&__gda__=1430342855_d8971e177381134369808555a1897248";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10690042_500154656793876_8819091098467092174_n.jpg?oh=b17234741f7b9583dde425ac18abef40&oe=55469CD9";;

YMCA programs and services have grown and adapted to the changing needs of families. Today, more and more parents are looking for quality, yet affordable childcare they can depend on. Whether your child is attending our infant/toddler program, preschool or our school age child care program, our goal is to provide a safe, fun environment. Like all Y programs, childcare is open to all.

With so many demands on today’s families, parents need all the support they can get. That’s why child care at the Y is about more than looking after kids. It’s about nurturing their development by providing a safe place for them to learn the foundational skills of Early Childhood Education, develop healthy, trusting relationships, and build self-reliance through the Y values. We believe the values and skills learned early on are vital building blocks for quality of life. The Preschool program is focused from the very beginning on Kindergarten readiness. We begin our Early Preschool program with our 2 ½ year olds. Our year-round curriculum includes thematic units that move the children through a progression of learning that can be adapted to meet the individual needs of the children at each level. Our facility allows us to provide the children breakfast, a full hot lunch and an afternoon snack as well as weekly swimming lessons and weekly gymnastics classes. We strive to educate the parent about the importance of their role in their child’s education from the very beginning. We keep parents informed through newsletters, scheduled and impromptu conferences, formal assessments and an open door policy that allows parents full view of what their child is involved in daily. We also encourage the parents to participate in family events throughout the year and to utilize our facility. A strong family relationship is vital to the ongoing education of our children, and we know that strong kids and strong families build strong communities.

We emphasize the four core values: caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility. We teach this to the children through day to day experiences, activities, and lessons. We give the children the opportunity to use verbal communication to solve problems. Our staff serves as positive role models and provides care that is supportive, nurturing, warm and responsive to each child's needs.  Our open door policy allows parents the freedom of knowing what their children are doing at all times during the day.

Designed to be community-based and to use community resources, every Head Start program offers the following services:

1. Education - Each child's individual needs are met, and ethnic and cultural characteristics of the community are served.

2. Health - Medical, dental, mental health, and nutritional services are provided by trained staff. At least one hot meal and a snack, equal to at least one-third of the daily minimum nutritional requirement, are provided.

3. Parent Involvement - Whether as a volunteer, a member of the policy council, or through participation in a class or workshop - all parents are encouraged to be involved with their children's education.

4. Social Services - Head Start Social Services staff works to network families with other community agencies to fill their family needs.

Last year, Head Start served 249 Jefferson County 3- and 4-year olds. Head Start classes are housed at St. Anthony’s School in Steubenville, Tiltonsville, Adena, Amsterdam, and New Alexandria.";"http://jeffersoncountycac.com/home/head_start";;"8:30-4:30";;"http://www.jeffersoncountycac.com/forms/show/3131";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"n";"n";;;;;;;

Knowing that, we embrace children as sources of their own learning and development, helping them to build relationships and explore their environment. Relationships make it possible for children to nurture their curiosity, question their surroundings, and hypothesize about possible connections that bring meaning to their world.

At Sprout Early Education Center, our internationally minded but locally engaged approach to helping children grow allows us to guide them through the learning process. This takes place through a nurturing teacher-child relationship. We believe that every child has the right to a caring and responsive teacher.

Connected Pathways’Â goal is to partner with families and take up the challenge.Â  We feel that, as things may be difficult, they are not impossible.Â  It is imperative, however, that we all understand that information and planning, timing, and a commitment to the partnership and direction we develop together are the necessary ingredients we need to achieve success.Â  It is with a genuine ambition that we build on our mantra to â€œEnlightening Familiesâ€¦One Child at a Timeâ€.";"http://c-pathways.com/";;"6am-9pm";"http://c-pathways.com/career-center/";"http://c-pathways.com/enroll-now/";;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://c-pathways.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Boy-With-Blocks-300x200.jpg";"http://c-pathways.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/children-sitting-300x200.jpg";"http://c-pathways.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/boy-with-legos-300x200.jpg";;;

The camp boasts a climbing tower, a 21 element ropes course, and zip line for developing climbing skills, confidence, and physical fitness. Campers also enjoy traditional camp activities, including archery, backpacking, canoeing, climbing, tennis, swimming, as well as the opportunity to develop interests in science and camp crafts under the guidance of our experienced staff. Horseback riding is also available for our girls program.

Red Oak has several programs for boys and girls ages 7 to 15.

Red Oak's Water Rocks Trails is a residence/trip camp for boys and girls ages 11 to 14. This program provides a fun, outdoor adventure experience that promotes growth, responsibility, and a solid work ethic. There are three separate 14-day sessions that you can choose throughout the summer. Campers are challenged to work together, develop outdoor leadership skills, practice eco friendly camping, and function autonomously as they embark on short climbing, canoeing, or backpacking trips, depending on the selected session. The program is designed so campers can participate in one or more sessions, and each session focuses on a different skill. During each session, campers are taught general camping skills, including outdoor cooking, trip preparation and packing, and low impact camping skills.

Red Barn is a day camp for boys ages 7-12. Each day the boys participate in fun but challenging outdoor activities, which include archery, canoeing, fishing, hiking, low ropes course, softball, swimming, outdoor science, crafts, wood crafting skills and more. Campers select from a wide menu of activities, and are encouraged to try all activities. Swimming lessons are mandatory.

Chincapin is a day for girls ages 8-12. The girls’ camp program includes the same challenges of climbing, rappelling, backpacking and canoeing activities as the young men’s’ programs, as well as archery, canoeing, fishing, hiking, low ropes course, softball, swimming, outdoor science, and crafts. Chincapin campers receive riding and horse care lessons 4 days a week. Chincapin's instruction focuses on safety, an appreciation of the sport, good riding form, and care for the animals.

The Red Oak Junior Counselor Leadership Program is for young men and women 13 to 15. This 6-week program runs during the day, with a one-week overnight component. The JCLP is a mixture of fun and learning with the primary focus of training young men and women in leadership, safety, and service, following American Camping Association and Red Oak Camp standards.

Red Oak now also offers several other one-week programs, including our Co-Ed Adventure Day Camp for boys and girls 7 to 12; and the Chincapin Equestrian Extension Week.";"http://redoakcamp.org/";"https://www.facebook.com/RedOakCamp";;"http://redoakcamp.org/employment/";"http://redoakcamp.org/";;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://redoakcamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/logo.png";"http://redoakcamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/riflerang-300x224.jpg";"http://redoakcamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/100_1405-300x224.jpg";"http://redoakcamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DSCF1438-300x225.jpg";"http://redoakcamp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bigwall-300x224.jpg";;

ASD develops dynamic programs using an experiential learning model and aligns its classes to state academic standards.           

           Since 1994, After School Discovery has nurtured children's interest in education and learning through fun, engaging programs. Students have experienced the magic of science while looking through microscopes, connected to learning through cooking, created modern dance choreography with professional dancers, and have been inspired by their success in learning. Over the years ASD has grown and has provided over 30,000 learning opportunities. 

          ASD collaborates with local school districts, organizations, and businesses in order to better carry out its mission. Research has shown that a child's success in school is influenced by parents, schools, and community members working together to support student achievement. ASD is an essential link in encouraging a strong support system for students through a community learning support team, volunteer programs and mentorship opportunities.";"http://www.afterschooldiscovery.com/#!donate/c1ghi";"https://www.facebook.com/AfterSchoolDiscovery";;;;;"n";"n";"n";"n";"y";"y";"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/d1b7b1_ffa3203a1f874835ac58b236b8ddeed4.jpg_srz_p_105_93_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz";"https://scontent-b-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10850060_517244301751578_406344499752416046_n.jpg?oh=f0855f090ca2cad3288ec4098ca76d9a&oe=553E365A";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10600380_516753081800700_3035806445860648258_n.jpg?oh=5e2408623bd75d9ebf20e6fcf9eb6383&oe=5534552C";"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10635754_504068956402446_2829878771788246686_n.jpg?oh=4d84bc000451da3256ed9efe81dd7efe&oe=55353AF7&__gda__=1430342855_d8971e177381134369808555a1897248";"https://scontent-a-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10690042_500154656793876_8819091098467092174_n.jpg?oh=b17234741f7b9583dde425ac18abef40&oe=55469CD9";;

We seek to inspire a passion for excellence and nurture curiosity, creativity, and imagination.  We focus not only on giving students a great education, but on preparing them for life.  Our dynamic classroom offers daily exploration into mathematics, language, science, botany, geography, sensorial, and practical life, all in a traditional Montessori environment.

At Avon Montessori Academy, students learn a strong sense of independence and self-discipline.  Success in school is directly tied to the degree that children believe in themselves as capable and independent human beings.  Our goal is to be flexible and creative in addressing each student as a unique individual.  These children, when offered the appropriate aesthetically pleasing, respectful environment within which to discover themselves, will grow their skills in all areas and the whole child will emerge.

Our mission is to create a natural learning environment that is educational and safe, where children can learn from and be motivated by their teachers and peers, while developing a positive self-esteem. Our objective is to prepare your children for school by teaching them basic academics and keeping them engaged through social activities. When children have an interest, they are eagered to learn about it. Rather than a set curriculum, our teachings thrive on the natural interests of our children. Our methods focus on creating motivation for learning and exploring through inspirational teaching and the development of self-esteem. Our team uses the latest behavioural techniques, focusing on positive reinforcement rather than traditional methods. You are welcomed and encouraged to visit us any time that your schedule allows. The relationship between caregivers and parents is a very special one and we foster it here.

We believe that providing children with quality childcare will assist in securing the direction of our future as a society. We provide children with competitive education, nutritious meal plans, interactive play areas, healthy learning and growing environments, and ultimately a place to be themselves. By doing this, we create a home-away-from-home environment for all of our Cirque-Mates.

We currently service the Garfield Hts./Maple Hts, and Cleveland (Lakeshore area) with our positive childcare plans as well as transportation to and from schools within the areas, as time permits.

Prior to our certification, the daycare was inspected by The State of Ohio to insure that strict guidelines for excellence in childcare were being followed. In addition, the owner of the facility had a background investigation, and had to provide written references regarding character and abilities to operate a daycare facility.
 
Creative Learning Daycare and Preschool is a member of the St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce. We are also a member of CCVillage.com, which is a network of childcare providers who are dedicated to raising the standards of childcare through education, awareness and networking. We also follow Harcatus CAP, Inc., CACFP guidelines for providing healthy meals and snacks for the children.
 
I, Shayna Parsons, owner and administrator of Creative Learning Daycare and Preschool have a Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Education from Ohio University Eastern. I have owned and operated a childcare business for 13 years. I reside in Belmont County with my boyfriend Donnie Buff and his 10 year old daughter Brynleigh.

I enjoy working with the children and their families. It is very rewarding for me to see children learn and grow in a supportive and loving environment. I have attended training workshops in infant and child CPR, effective methods of nurturing positive growth and development in children, and in proper nutrition for children. Also, I attend monthly preschool meetings designed to foster and enhance an effective preschool program.
 
Our preschool program is in session year round. It is available full or part-time from the ages of 3 to 5 years of age. We collaborate with the Belmont County Head Start Program. We also work with Ohio University Eastern’s and Belmont Technical College's student teaching internship program.
 
We provide a variety of activities for the children each day. During the preschool sessions, we have crafts, interactive group activities, educational exercises, free play, songs and field trips. We have both indoor and outdoor toys and play equipment available for supervised play. Indoor play areas have a variety of blocks, books, musical instruments, dolls, tools, cars and computer activities. The outdoor play area is a combined: spacious grassy area for running and swinging, and a defined playground toy area complete with slide, playhouse and assorted toys. During the summer we enjoy routine field trips to the local public pool.

By enrolling your child in pre-kindergarten child care, you’re developing his or her social skills and introducing him or her to an environment that will cultivate an active lifestyle as well as a desire to learn.

But when selecting the right child care program, the decision should always come down to one thing: Where will your child get the individual attention that is so important in these early years? The answer to that question is Eagle’s Christian Preschool and Childcare.

Our center is a star quality rated facility and a model center of excellence in early childhood education. The cumulative years of education and classroom instructional experience among our teaching staff is 89+ years. Our staff brings a wealth of expertise and knowledge regarding best teaching practices in the classroom. Providing a safe, warm, friendly and developmentally appropriate environment for children ages 6 weeks to 12 years of age is an expected standard for Greater Expectations Learning Center.

We take great care in implementing our state`s pre-schoolEarly Learning and Development Standards (ELDS) in our classrooms. We plan activities to academically strengthen our children for their futures. The staff recognizes the importance of balanced growth so they provide opportunities for mental, physical and emotional growth through a variety of creative experiences. Our goal is to encourage children to learn as individuals by exploring, experimenting, self-expression, as well as by example. These goals are also exemplified in our extended school-age program. Our before and after school program follows the state`s extended after school Common Core State Standards which are reflected in our lesson plans and implemented for every subject area.

We provide daily two nourishing meals and one nutritious snack. We are a part of the CACFP food program. There are both indoor/outdoor play areas for all our children.

Although our teaching experience is great, our school has only been in existence for two years and has already gained our state star quality rating within a year due in part by the hard work of experienced and dedicated staff and teachers. We believe it`s because of this hard work and dedication we will continue to grow.";"http://gelc1150.com/contact.html";"https://www.facebook.com/gelc1150";"Mon - Fri:

This means that we believe knowledge is constructed rather than acquired through an active process of exploring, investigating, and playing. The curriculum, which is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach, is built upon the notion that every child is capable and competent.  

Our approach is based on the following premises:

    Children are full of potential, have many ideas and theories, and an eagerness to learn.
    Joyful learning is promoted daily.
    Time spent outdoors is essential to a child's well-being.
    Respect is accorded to all members of the community through encouraging and understanding multiple points of view.
    The environment promotes interaction and cooperation.
    Listening is a central role of the adult. Listening is reflected in the on-going documentation and study of children's ideas and investigations.
    Communication is a reciprocal process involving the home and the school.
    Parents are viewed as partners with teachers.

We'll have Bible stories and character building stories as well as many hands on activities to help your child discover the joys of learning.

Math and whole language can be fun, even for little ones. We'll use many experiences of life to help us learn how things work as we explore reading, writing, art and math and music.

Our classes will be small for a better learning experience for your child. Our teachers will have a college degree and have an assistant meeting the requirements of our license through ODJFS.

Students enjoy sharing with their friends and take turns bringing a snack for the group. We all have a lot of fun working and playing together.

You're welcome to visit our preschool and get acquainted with us. We have enrollment packs available to be returned with a $50 enrollment fee. We'll have you and your child come in for an interview and see how we can learn together.

We're a non-denominational Christian preschool that will encourage families to grow in their faith in Jesus as their Savior and Lord and attend a church that teaches God's Word.

Tutoring for students Pre K through Grade 6 can be arranged after school or on Friday afternoons. Check with us for more information.

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

MYCAP is Helping People, Changing Lives.";"http://www.my-cap.org/locations";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/MYCAP-Mahoning-Youngstown-Community-Action-Partnership/253808185491";;"http://www.my-cap.org/about/employment";;;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://www.my-cap.org/wp-content/themes/mycap/images/mycaplogo.png";;;;;;

Within the next few years, due mainly to the steady influx of immigrants, the parish had grown so large that the little church could no longer accommodate its parishioners. Rather than build a larger church, then Archbishop Purcell, favored the formation of second parish. On April 6, 1861, the congregation unanimously resolved that a division be effected along ethnic lines: German and Irish. It was decided by the drawing of lots that the Irish would retain the original church property, renaming the parish St. Patrick. The German community received the sum of $1500.00 to build a new church, St. Boniface.
In 1862, land was purchased at the corner of Blue Rock and Lakeman Streets and in November, 1863, the new church was blessed. Students attended school in the parsonage and by 1867 it was decided that there was no longer adequate space at the parsonage to accommodate the steady increase in pupils. The parish purchased additional property adjacent to the church. By 1870, an ornate, solidly constructed, two-story brick building consisting of four school rooms was erected on Blue Rock Street at a cost of $7,800.00.

By 1885, however, it was necessary to build an addition consisting of two rooms on the second floor as well as a chapel and meeting room on the ground floor. In the early 1900’s, another large addition was made to the school and a residence was built on Lakeman Street for the Sisters of Charity who taught at the school. The parishes of St. Clare (College Hill) and St. Pius (South Cumminsville) branched off, and still the parish and school grew. By 1913, St. Boniface School had 600 pupils and in 1921, the property at Chase and Pitts was purchased with plans for a new and much larger church.

The present magnificent church and rectory were completed in 1927 and the existing school building opened in 1933. In 1979, the parish school became a combined school with St. Boniface and St. Leo participating. At this time, the governance of the school shifted from the parish to the newly formed St. Boniface School Board.

The Sisters of Charity continued to serve the school until 1999.

Our mission is to provide a learning environment for young children that nurture all aspects of their development including physical, emotional, cognitive, language, social, and spiritual domains.  We believe that the learning environment is enhanced by the teachers who recognize that teaching and learning happen simultaneously for both children and teachers.


Philosophy
We believe that all children should be respected as individuals.  All children deserve learning opportunities that are based on their unique developmental needs. We recognize that each child has his/her own distinct, creative learning process.  The curriculum supports children through the hands-on experiences of manipulation, mastery and meaning in a safe, nurturing environment without fear of failure, rejection, or judgment.

We believe the learning environment is not conclusive to only one early childhood learning philosophy or ideology due to the diversity of the learning styles among the children.  Our philosophy is based on an infusion of many philosophies to meet the needs of the children in order to promote a healthy learning atmosphere.";"http://sunmoonstarspreschool.com/";;;;"http://sunmoonstarspreschool.com/Registration.html";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";"http://sunmoonstarspreschool.com/images/f2439adb825aebcb6cbf64896f3e60ad.jpg";;;;;;

We also believe in the whole-language approach and surrounding the children in a print rich environment even before they can read.

We are a non-profit Community Action Agency dedicated to helping families move from poverty and crisis to family stability and self-sufficiency.

Community Action Agencies were formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 vision for a Great Society. There are 1,100 Community Action Agencies across the country and 50 in the State of Ohio. MYCAP is part of the National Community Action Partnership designated to serve residents in Mahoning County, which encompasses the City of Youngstown, suburban communities and the rural villages in the western part of the county.

Today, MYCAP provides critical programs and services. Some of these are Energy Assistance Programs, which include home weatherization and utility payment assistance for eligible income homeowners; education and classroom instruction for individuals to increase the chances that they will secure employment; nutrition services for vulnerable mothers and young children; pre-school classes for young children so they are prepared and successful when they enter kindergarten; transportation for seniors and those with a disability in Western Mahoning County who need a ride to health providers, grocery stores and other locations; and much more.

We serve individuals and families who meet the federal poverty income guidelines. There are specific income guidelines for every program or service we provide. If you qualify, please get in touch with us because we would love to help you.

We have a federally mandated tripartite board composed of elected officials, private sector representatives and low-income representatives committed to:

    Empowering low-income individuals and families in their effort to become self-sufficient.
    Advocating for a poverty-free community.
    Stimulating expansion of economic opportunity for the poor and the community through economic development programs and services.

The development of the program is in response to the needs of many families for full-day programming for their kindergarten-age child.

The district sent a Request for Proposals to 21 area preschool and daycare providers to organize and implement a combination childcare/learning opportunities program at Ottawa Hills Elementary School. Of the proposals received, the district has chosen to partner with Gateway School to provide the program. Gateway has titled their program “The B.E.A.R. Program” (Beyond Education and Recreation).

The program will provide childcare, but will also provide activities that support and reinforce the skills being taught in the kindergarten classroom. The program is not envisioned to be another half day of kindergarten, but as a time for students to grow developmentally in a play-based environment that has opportunities for developmentally appropriate social interaction. The district will work closely with Gateway to offer long-term overviews and short-term information concerning units and lessons being covered in the kindergarten classroom so that B.E.A.R. Program activities will reinforce student learning.

Gateway was chosen because of their teacher/student ratios (1:10), their experience in specializing in early childhood care, their reasonable monthly fees, and the qualifications of their teaching staff. Any staff member teaching in the B.E.A.R. Program will have an Associate’s or Bachelor’s Degree in Early Childhood Development. In addition, the Program Director, Dan O’Connor, will be an integral part of leading and teaching the program.

The program will be a separate entity, organized and implemented within our elementary building. Gateway will be renting classroom space from the school district and will be using their expertise to partner with the district in providing a program that complements our district’s kindergarten program. - See more at: http://www.ohschools.k12.oh.us/districtNewsArticle.aspx?artID=757#sthash.CutEmwYB.a3IwoP8j.dpuf";"http://www.ohschools.k12.oh.us/districtNewsArticle.aspx?artID=757#sthash.CutEmwYB.dpbs";"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ottawa-Hills-Local-Schools/378134162312781?hc_location=timeline";;"http://www.ohschools.k12.oh.us/AdministrativeDepartment2.aspx?aid=6";"http://www.ohschools.k12.oh.us/content_page2.aspx?cid=266";;"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://www.ohschools.k12.oh.us/images/full/FlashHeader012-0.jpg";;;;;

    Taught by a STATE Licensed Teacher
    Standards based education
    Theme driven curriculum 
    Focus on purposeful play
    Caring & nurturing environment
    Collaboration with local schools for  Kindergarten Readiness

Our part-time preschool will focus on the necessary skills for student success in Kindergarten and beyond.  A theme based, standards driven curriculum taught by highly qualified and caring mentors will be the foundation of this program. Children ages 3-5 will be engaged in a variety of opportunities to play and explore the world around them in order to understand and foster the joy of learning.

The staff at The Workshop Learning Center is well qualified. All of the teachers are currently licensed by the state of Ohio with classroom teaching experience. The director has over 10 years of experience teaching children.  Collaboration with local schools ensures that our program will prepare students for kindergarten.   

Daily activities will vary and include language and math work, music and movement, arts and crafts, fine motor development, science exploration and dramatic play and much more.   

We are now accepting applications for the 2012-2013 school year. Our staff to child ratio will be 1 to 8; so space is very limited. This program is designed for children ages 3-5. We have am & pm classes on Tuesday and Thursday. A Friday morning class will be offered to students who will be attending Kindergarten in the following year.

All too often, children are taught in a “one size fits all” manner, overlooking each child’s personal learning style. The reality is that we all learn in different ways. To be successful, we all need to be taught and allowed to learn according to our own unique style. When a child’s uniquely effective learning style is discovered, it works like magic. Suddenly, the child actually enjoys learning and can awaken in him or herself an excitement to learn.

The Tree of Knowledge is continuously building relationships with schools across the United States giving more students access to programming they need and deserve. At Tree of Knowledge Learning Centers, our educational specialists access and reveal each child’s unique learning style and develop individualized educational plans that create an enthusiasm to learn.

Our mission at Tree of Knowledge Learning Centers is to deliver psycho-educational services to children who are at-risk academically and/or physically so they can achieve academic success and develop hope for a rewarding life.";"http://www.treeofknowledge.us/";;;"http://www.treeofknowledge.us/contact/employment/";;;"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"not mentioned in the website";"http://www.treeofknowledge.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ToK-logo-web1.png";"http://www.treeofknowledge.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/chalkboard.gif";"http://www.treeofknowledge.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/eager-schoolgirl-2.gif";;;;

Our program is designed to meet the major developmental needs of preschool children.  We place great emphasis on the emotional, social, cognitive, and physical needs of the children. Each child is encouraged to develop a strong sense of self-esteem while learning at his or her own pace.

We provide a nurturing environment where children can learn naturally by socializing with their peers and take part in learning centers.  Understanding to play, share, and work together is addressed throughout our program.

Field trips are planned to coordinate with our units of study.  Written evaluations for three-year-olds are provided and conferences are held for four-year-olds.  Parents are welcome to participate at nursery school by attending class programs, reading stories, becoming class helpers or volunteering at special times.  We encourage strong ties between home and school environment.

We feel it is important to keep the student:teacher ratios as low as possible.  The ratios we feel work best to create and safe and effective environment are:

Pre-Three Year Old Class: 1 teacher to 7 students
Three Year Old Class: 1 teacher to 7 students
Four Year Old Class: 1 teacher to 10 students";"http://villagenurseryschoolatfederated.com/";;;;"http://villagenurseryschoolatfederated.com/?page_id=46";"http://villagenurseryschoolatfederated.com/?page_id=21";"n";"n";"y";"y";"n";"n";;"http://villagenurseryschoolatfederated.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1-224x300.jpg";;;;;

that the first years of a child's life is by far the most important, helping to lay the foundation for all intellectual, emotional and spiritual development to follow. Through nurturing and individualized attention, we take great care to provide a warm, friendly, Christian and exciting environment for your child, while ensuring they receive the guidance and structure they need.

We strive to nurture your child's ideas and imagination, acknowledge each child's individuality, and validate each personality and individual differences.

Our goal is to provide a place where children know that they are accepted, loved, protected, and wanted; helping to instill in each child a strong sense of self-worth and purpose as a unique planned child of God. Our job is to make sure that each child has numerous positive experiences and interactions throughout each day. It is our hope that when the day is done, and children go home, they feel happy and proud of themselves; eager to express the happenings of their day to you.

The needs of children and their parents are the primary concerns of Youthland Academy's child care philosophy. By providing the best possible daycare to children, we are contributing to the happiness and the security of their parents and to the community they live in.

First and foremost, Youthland Academy provides children constant and alert supervision in a safe environment, screened from hazards. The large classroom with designated area for learning centers provide for both quiet and active play. Our entire program is designed to enable children to have a positive self-concept and to know success and fulfillment through programs of positive self-concept and to know success from the beginning. This is possible because our Academy environment provides children the opportunity to be safe in their quest as natural leaders.

Youthland Academy isn't merely a childcare center, it's a ""learning center"" that assists children to realize success and fulfillment through programs of positive self-image. Children experience the joy of learning; they feel loved and accepted. Our program is our attitude.

Our Teachers and Directors are provided monthly themes that ignite each child's unique pleasure in learning. The monthly curriculum suggests proven ways to include these themes in a variety of ""discovery centered"" activities. Using the curriculum's themes, each teacher designs individualized lesson plans. We do not adhere to the standardized lesson plan because we feel there is no standard child or standard class. This is why we keep our teacher-child ratio at the level that comfortably supports personal attention.

Included with classroom discovery and stimulation are field trips. At some of our Academies, we also provide activities such as gymnastics and dance classes. These services enable parents to further enrich their children's lives without cutting into the quality time parents and children share after working hours.

Progress reports are given to parents to keep them up-to-date on the total growth of their children. Formal conferences are scheduled yearly to discuss a child's progress. However, parents are encouraged to meet their child's teacher and director, and visit the Academy at any time they feel necessary.";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/locations/dayton";;" 6:30am to 6:30pm";;;;"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";"y";;"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/139/content_580490_10151499682281211_1585200262_n.jpg";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/7/content_nursery-school-teaching.jpg";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/138/content_1377348_10151877935546211_176283268_n.jpg";"http://www.youthlandacademy.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/3/content_preschool-classrooms.jpg";;
